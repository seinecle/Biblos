Journal of General Management   Vol. 19 No. 3 Spring 1994   Government's Impact   on the Business   Environment and   Strategic Management   by   Frans A.J. van den Bosch, Professor of Management andArd-Pieter de   i Man, Research Associate, Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus   University Rotterdam.   Should 'government' be a fifth force in Michael Porter's model of the Competitive   Advantage of Nations and, if so, what should be the appropriate level of analysis?   In the strategic management literature, frameworks explaining the impact of   the national environment, and more particularly of government, on firms and   industries are still in their infancy. Michael Porter's 'The Competitive   Advantage of Nations' [ 1 ] proposes a new integrative framework consisting   of four determinants (the so-called diamond) and aimed at a comprehensive   analysis of the above-mentioned impact. After a short overview of the   diamond model and a general critique, this paper will deal with the important   question of whether government is adequately integrated into Porter's   ! framework. Stated more precisely: whether government can be considered   ! as a fifth determinant. Porter has already recognized the indirect role of   government in creating competitive advantage, but denies a direct role. To   I demonstrate whether government does have a direct role and, if so, how large   its influence is, is both a theoretical and empirical question. Although a   \ definite answer upon this question is beyond the scope of this paper, we will   contribute to this challenging question by focusing on two aspects.   The first aspect will deal with the implications of the level of analysis   with respect to the government. Porter analyzes government's role primarily   at the macro level. However, the ongoing internationalization process forces   us to redirect our attention from the macro to the meso and micro levels of   policy making and government-business interaction. As a second aspect, we   will discuss whether the role and impact of government changes over time.   Porter believes in a diminishing role as time proceeds. We will criticize this   irreversible role. We will also pay attention to the combined effect of both   I aspects of our question. This means that we will investigate whether the   relevant level of analysis with respect to government's role is time dependent.   Journal of General Management   Vol. 19 No. 3 Spring 1994   Porter's Framework   Porter rejects the view that a country's competitiveness is solely based on   a rich amount of production factors. Instead, he claims that innovativeness   is the key to world market success. His analysis focuses on the influence   of the business environment on the process of upgrading. Porter discusses   a rich variety of innovation enhancing determinants, thereby simultaneously   providing a framework for comparative environmental analysis. For the   development of a coherent body of knowledge of strategic management   this is an important contribution. The relatively neglected field of macro   environmental analysis is brought a considerable step forward. For the   development of a dynamic theory of strategy, incorporating theories of the   business environment is a prerequisite [2].   Porter's framework (the 'diamond') identifies four determinants of   competitive advantage (see Figure 1). The first determinant is 'factor   conditions'. Porter distinguishes two kinds of production factors: basic   factors and advanced factors. Basic factors include the traditional production   factors: raw materials, labour etc. Advanced factors are considered to be   more important. They are created factors which are very hard to imitate, like   education. The second determinant is 'firm strategy, structure and rivalry'.   Journal of General Management   Vol. 19 No. 3 Spring 1994   Strategy and structure differ per country. Rivalry is central in Porter's   analysis; more than any other factor it stimulates companies to upgrade their   production process. Thirdly, Porter points out the importance of 'demand   conditions'. Consumer demand in a country is an impetus for innovation,   when consumers are demanding and critical. Finally,' related and supporting   industries' form a determinant of competitive advantage. Interaction with   suppliers and clients stimulates upgrading; cooperation in developing new   products becomes easier. The determinants do not operate in isolation, but   influence each other. The determinants are complemented by two influencing   factors: chance and government. Chance refers to unexpected developments   (scientific breakthroughs, wars etc.) that can activate change. Regarding   government Porter states: 'Government's real role in national competitive   advantage is in influencing the four determinants' (p. 126). Government   plays a role for instance with respect to demand conditions. By legally   enforcing high quality standards or by using its own procurement and   investments, government is able to play a significant role in this determinant.   Government can create favourable conditions for business and can act as a   challenger for it. But according to Porter, government cannot create a   competitive advantage other than indirectly via the determinants.   Criticism   Porter has been criticized on, among others, the lack of clear definitions of   the determinants [3], the applicability of his framework to regions [4], his   treatment of multinationals [5] and his ideas concerning the role of national   culture in competitive advantage [6] and the notion of stages of national   competitiveness, which Porter defines [7]. We return to the latter issue later.   Stopford and Strange [8] have included government as the fifth determinant   of the competitive advantage of nations in their modified version of the   diamond. They claim that in developing countries this is justified, but do not   go into this in depth.   Clearly the framework can be criticized. Other recent books on the   subject of competitive advantage of nations (e.g. Ohmae [9] and Reich [10])   only partly agree with Porter's analysis. Yet there has also been ample   support for Porter's theory. Ergas [11] identified many of the factors Porter   incorporates in his diamond. Kogut [12] seems to agree with Porter almost   completely and the already quoted article by Grant is mainly positive. In this   paper one of the elements that has attracted less attention in the discussions   about 'The Competitive Advantage of Nations' is considered in more detail,   namely the role of government.   Government Policy: contents and consistency   What becomes clear in both ' The Competitive Advantage of Nations' and its   criticism is the enormous pluriformity of governmental measures that can   influence competitive advantage. Indeed, in Chapter 12 of 'The Competitive   Journal of General Management   Vol. 19 No. 3 Spring 1994   Advantage of Nations' Porter identifies a large number of policies that have   an impact on upgrading. In developing his approach, Porter consistently   works out the relation of each policy with upgrading and innovation. Grant   compares some of Porter's ideas on government with traditional views on   policy and finds very interesting differences.   In neo-classical economic theorizing, for instance, a currency   devaluation can be seen as a means to create a competitive advantage and   thereby enhance exports. Porter, however, points out that this kind of   competitive advantage is short-lived. Most importantly, a devaluation can   temporarily shelter a country's industries and thereby block innovation,   because the artificial relief from competition creates the impression that   there is no need to innovate. Another example is Porter's idea that stringent   regulation of product and process standards can stimulate upgrading and   creates a competitive advantage when regulation anticipates international   standards. The traditional ideas on government consider almost any   regulation as an expensive nuisance, that restricts companies and raises   their costs. Anti-trust policies aimed at horizontal collaboration must be   strict, according to Porter, even with increasing international competition.   Most authorities have a more lenient attitude to mergers and acquisitions   when these are a reaction to competition from abroad. It must be noted that   the discussion about anti-trust policy has a long history. There is widespread   agreement about the advantages of competition in general. But there is   much disagreement about the question how much competition is optimal   (for a different opinion than Porter's see, e.g. Jorde and Teece [13]). Porter   indeed provides a different view on government. It would not be surprising   if many governments, by using the Porter framework, may find that there   are many unintended consequences of their policies. The practical usefulness   of the framework with regard to analyzing existing government policies is   therefore considerable. Yet Porter's treatment of government in his diamond   framework also raises questions. The role of government should be made   much more explicit in the framework. In the next paragraphs three   observations relating to this topic will be presented. In the first place the   deficiencies related to a limited interpretation of government's role in the   diamond are illustrated. Secondly, new forms of policy emerge that are   directed at the micro-level and are not included in Porter's framework.   Finally, the changing role of government over time is analyzed.   The Integration of Government in the Diamond: the cases of Japan   and Italy   Concerning the first point we shall limit ourselves to two cases: the role of   MITI in Japan and the role of local government in the Third Italy. Both cases   have already been analysed by other authors before Porter, such as Piore   and Sabel [14]. A comparison of these analyses with Porter's case studies   leads to the conclusion that his treatment of government differs substantially   from what other authors have found. Here we shall primarily use the   Journal of General Management   Vol. 19 No. 3 Spring 1994   treatment of Best [15], who draws heavily on Piore and Sabel but provides   a more recent account of the cases they use. Best's basic argument is that   increasingly manufacturing is shifting from low quality mass production   ('Old Competition' in Best's terminology) towards higher quality goods   produced by flexible specialization ('New Competition'). One of the main   features of the New Competition is that this change is enhanced by a strategic   industrial policy executed by government. Another important feature is the   balance between competition and cooperation. This balance is induced by   public policies.   The first case is the role of MITI in the Japanese economy. Porter   praises the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) for   the role it has played in the post-war period. The upgrading of Japanese   industries was encouraged by many MITI policies, which all worked through   the diamond. Yet, according to Porter, MITI only had a significant direct   influence on Japanese industry in the immediate after-war period. Porter also   points to some mistakes made by MITI. Best, on the contrary, finds a larger   impact of MITI on industry. One of the omissions in Porter seems to be the   MITI restructuring policy, that is still in operation today. This restructuring   policy may be as central to Japanese competitive advantage as policy in the   early phases of growth. In general, Porter finds a diminishing role of MITI   over time: the more the Japanese economy grew, the smaller MITI's   influence got. However, Best finds a changing role of government towards   industry over time, depending on the phase of the life-cycle an industry is in.   When a new industry emerges, MITI's influence is large. Once a self-  supporting industry has come about, the influence diminishes, but at the end   of the industry life-cycle the restructuring is again led by MITI. So, it is   possible that at the same time MITI is very active in some industries and   almost absent in others. A generic change over time of MITI's role is not   supported by Best's research. It depends on where the industry stands in its   life-cycle. The changing role of government over time will be discussed   further below. For now, it suffices to say that the relation between Japanese   industry and MITI in Porter has more antagonistic traits, while Best identifies   more cooperation between the parties (although partly involuntary and often   temporary).   Even more striking is the difference in asecond case: the Italian tile   industry in the Sassuolo area. In Porter's account of the successes of Italian   tile manufacturers, the government is almost completely absent. The reason   for this is that Porter mainly looks at government at the national level. But   things are different when local governments are taken into account. Porter   does not deny that, but neither does he study the subject in detail. Best's   account of Italy, however, takes local government as a point of departure.   The difference is striking. 'Local government intrusion in company activities   was not a factor in any of the cases we studied, even where the government   in the area was controlled by the Italian Communist Party', Porter writes (p.   448). Best's analysis, on the other hand, is an attempt to prove how far-  Journal of General Management   Vol. 19 No. 3 Spring 1994   reaching and successful the co-operation between local governments (in   majority communist) and clusters of small enterprises was. In the creation   of industrial parks, inter-firm productive associations and all kinds of   consortia, local government has played an important role in Italy. According   to Best, ' ...local government has been able to pursue an aggressive   economic program and retain a degree of insulation from interest group   politics by creating a range of extra- and inter-firm institutions' (p. 209).   Acknowledging that each theory, when applied, cannot escape some   subjective bias, the difference in analysis between Best and Porter is still   remarkable. Without concluding that one of the two approaches is right and   the other wrong, it seems safe to say that local government is a part of   government that Porter has not studied in depth. The same is true with   respect to provincial government [16]. The practical implication of this is   that local government can play a role in business development and   companies should be more active in searching for support at the local level   [17]. Other (historical) examples of a more integrated role of government   in structuring the business environment can be found in Tolliday [18].   Micro-Level Policies   'Firms compete in industries, not nations' (Porter, p. 619). If this is true,   then government's attention should be directed at the meso and micro   levels of policy-making as well. Historically, this has probably not always   been the case, but increasingly a shift is observed to policy-making that   takes the firm into account as an innovating entity. Ostry [19] identifies   internationalisation as the driving force behind the development of policies   on the micro-level. The Gatt negotiations limitthe options for macro-policy   and the multinational enterprise makes policy on a macro-level less   effective. As a consequence governments turn more often to innovation   policy and regulating foreign direct investment, rather than to traditional   industrial policy.   Branscomb [20] describes one of the new forms of policy that are   emerging. He introduces the term 'capability enhancing' technology   policy. The object of this kind of policy is that 'companies must learn to   absorb new technologies'. In order to achieve this, government should   stimulate research in the pre-competitive phase as well as the diffusion of   technologies. The development and diffusion of generic technologies must   be the core of this policy. Also, governmental support for research   endeavours should only take place in agreement with market forces.   Picking winners is out of the question. Although much of this policy   prescription by Branscomb is criticized, we can conclude that in the future   newpolicy instruments will come about. Governments innovate too and are   confronted with policy competition between different levels of government.   The question is whether the Porter framework will be able to explain these   new policies adequately. It is not unthinkable that in the near future they   will go further than Porter advises. Especially with respect to externalities,   Journal of General Management   Vol. 19 No. 3 Spring 1994   e.g. where market failures cause firms to under-invest. As recognized by   Porter, this gives rise to a direct role of government in influencing the   diamond. When these policies develop they may become increasingly   intertwined with the diamond. The more new policies are created which are   directed at the meso- and micro- levels and which have a more direct role in   influencing the diamond, the less the government can be treated as an outside   factor.   The Role and Impact of Government Over Time in Porter's Framework   Porter considers his framework to be a contribution to the development of a   dynamic theory of strategy. Therefore a closer look into the dynamic aspect   of his analysis is interesting. Firstly, the influence of time in the Porter   framework is not clearly developed. To illustrate this, we focus on the most   dynamic part of his analysis, the Four Stages of National Competitive   Development. The first stage is the factor driven stage, in which an economy   is primarily based on an abundant supply of basic production factors. The   industries compete on price and use widely available technologies. In   Porter's model this stage is followed by the investment driven stage, in which   aggressive investment occurs in efficient scale facilities and foreign   technologies. Technologies are not only applied but also improved upon.   The third stage is called the innovation driven stage, in which the full   diamond is strongly developed. Not only are technologies appropriated from   other countries, but firms also create them themselves. The final stage Porter   distinguishes, is the wealth driven stage, in which the preservation of   acquired wealth is the goal of investors and managers. In this stage the   economic health of the country is eroded by shifting preferences and   preserving what has been done in the past.   Porter proposes that the role of government in creating competitive   advantage changes during these stages. In the factor driven stage, the   possibilities for direct government interference are the greatest. Subsidies   and temporary protection are most powerful in this stage. However, according   to Porter over time the role of government must shift to a more indirect   approach. Companies must take the lead and intervention must decrease the   more countries reach the innovation driven stage. Wade [21] supports the   idea that the government role will shift over time. Yet the degree of   government interference he found in his comprehensive study of the Newly   Industrializing Countries, is much larger throughout the phases of development   than Porter claims. The effectiveness of government intervention may   indeed be inversely related to the stages of economic development, but not   to the extent claimed by Porter. For instance, Wade identifies quite some   successful attempts at targeting, while according to Porter the record of even   the best targeting governments is mixed. Also, once the Asian tigers had   reached a state of considerable competitiveness, government continued to   play a very important role. As pointed out in a previous section, a study of   the role of government related to industry- life cycles, m ight very wel 1 change   Journal of General Management   Vol. 19 No. 3 Spring 1994   the general conclusions about it losing its influence along the stages of   national competitive development. Where in some industries this role may   decline, in others it may be decisive.   Finally, Porter does not really identify the mechanism behind this   changing role of government. In our view it may be that the innovation   driven stage of development is more complex compared with the preceding   ones, so that it would be better for governmental influence to take place at   a lower policy level and with different instruments. Perhaps the information   requirements for policy in such an economy are too high for a government;   this would be an explanation inspired by Hayek [22]. It may also be   possible that in the innovation driven stage a country has a more   internationalized economy, than in the factor driven stage. This diminishes   the effectiveness and political feasibility of national policies; for macro-  economic policy Cooper [23] points at this effect. A definite assessment   of Porter's conclusions about government's changing and indirect role in   influencing the national diamond can not be made without knowing the   basic mechanisms that lie behind it.   Summary and Conclusions   Porter describes an abundant amount of governmental policies that have an   impact on competitiveness. However, an important question is whether the   government is adequately integrated in his framework of four determinants   of competitive advantage. Or stated more precisely, whether Porter is   correct by not including government as a fifth determinant of competitive   advantage. Although a definite answer upon this question has not been   given here, we have contributed to this challenging issue by elaborating on   two aspects of the role of government in creating competitive advantage:   the influence of time and the impact of the chosen level of analysis. In   Porter's framework the influence of time remains underdeveloped. By   paying more attention to this aspect we are able to show that more insight   can be gained into government's role in influencing the diamond. Especially   the industry specific role of government during the industry life-cycle   deserves attention. This leads to our second finding: the importance of the   level of analysis with respect to government. While Porter looks mainly at   government at the national level, we stress the growing importance of   government's influence at the local and regional level as well. Also we   found a shift from macro-economic policies to micro-economic policies.   Whether these findings produce enough evidence to make government the   fifth determinant is ultimately an empirical question.   Nevertheless Porter's framework shows that considerably more   governmental actions influence competitive advantage than many policy   makers and managers may have thought. A conscious analysis of policies   with the aid of the diamond including our two additional aspects of   government's role, may benefit the quality of government policies. It may   Journal of General Management   Vol. 19 No. 3 Spring 1994   also contribute to a better understanding of government's impact on the   business environment and strategic management. This understanding   stimulates managers to play an important role in shaping government   policies that enhance the national diamond in their industry and thereby the   competitive advantage of their firms.

Reputation Management Capabilities as   Decision Rules*  Pursey P. M. A. R. Heugens, Cees B. M. van Riel and  Frans A. J. van den Bosch  Utrecht University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam           We draw on a detailed grounded theory study of the reactions of Dutch  food firms to the recent introduction of genetically modified foods to inductively  identify the capabilities that firms develop in response to reputational threats. Central  to the view on capabilities we propose are the decision rules organizations use to   link individual actions to organizational outcomes. Four reputation management  capabilities were identified, which were aimed at, respectively: (1) engaging in a  cooperative dialogue with relevant stakeholders; (2) presenting the organizational  point of view favourably in the eyes of external beholders; (3) avoiding organizational  ‘ownership’ of critical reputational threats; and (4) communicating meaningfully with  affected parties, even under conditions of high adversity and time-pressure.  INTRODUCTION  Which types of systematic internal responses do organizations develop to protect  themselves against the impact of reputational threats? Do all organizations rely   on a singular response mechanism or do some draw on a greater repertoire of  responses? Two intertwined trends have meant that these questions are now more  salient than ever before. On the one hand, academics and practitioners alike are  starting to recognize corporate reputation – the relative standing of an organiza-  tion amongst its peers as perceived by its stakeholders[1] – as one of the most pre-  cious resources available to organizations (Fombrun, 1996; Fombrun and van Riel,  2004; Hall, 1992; Kay, 1993; Whetten and Mackey, 2002). On the other, the busi-  ness world has recently been confronted with reputational threats in unprece-  dented numbers and of an unparalleled impact.[2] In this paper we address the  aforementioned questions by inductively developing a theory of reputation man-  Journal of Management Studies 41:8 December 2004  0022-2380  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Our theory is rooted in a detailed grounded theory study (Glaser  and Strauss, 1967) of corporate responses to the reputational threats associated  with the recent introduction of genetically modified foods on the European  market.  Reputational threats – events or trends that could have a negative impact on an  organization’s relative status amongst its peers as perceived by its stakeholders if  left unattended – usually come in one of two forms: crises or issues. A crisis can  be seen as a ‘low probability, high impact event that threatens the viability of the  organization and is characterized by ambiguity of cause, effect, and means of  resolution, as well as by a belief that decisions must be made swiftly’ (Pearson and  Clair, 1998, p. 60). Alternatively, issues have been defined as ‘a gap between the  expectations of a stakeholder regarding corporate behavior and the same stake-  holder’s perceptions of actual corporate behavior’ (Nigh and Cochran, 1987, p.  4). Key differences between these two types of reputational threats are that the  former are immediate, unexpected, and henceforth open to many kinds of often  speculative interpretations (Pearson and Clair, 1998), whereas the latter are slowly  evolving, relatively predictably, and often highly politicized in the sense that  affected actors are entrenching themselves in rivalling coalitions based on their  solution preferences (Lamertz et al., 2003). These differences are not without con-  sequence, because both types of reputational threats play a different role in orga-  nizational learning and change processes. Crises represent ‘shocks’ or ‘jolts’ that  open organizations up to the possibility of change, whereas less immediate issues  allow organizations to engage in learning processes like comparing, analysing,  explaining and devising analogies.[3] The immanent differences between these two  types of reputational threats also stimulate organizations to develop multiple rep-  utation management capabilities, each geared specifically towards crises or issues.  CAPABILITIES AS DECISION RULES  What is the essence of organizational capability?[4] At the most basic level, this  notion entails an organization’s ability to accomplish some specific desired result,  say: R (Winter, 2000, pp. 981–2). This implies that we can express organizational  capability with respect to a certain task as a single dummy variable: either the  organization has the R capability and can therefore produce the outcome (XR =  1), or it lacks such a capability and is thus unable to produce it (XR = 0). In fact,  this teleological aspect of organizational capabilities is so commonly accepted that  most capabilities are denoted by the organizational outcome they are meant to  produce, such as: marketing capabilities (Day, 1994), leadership capabilities  (Useem and Harder, 2000), and information systems capabilities (Feeny and   Willcocks, 1998). Teleology is thus central to the concept of capability, but at the  1350 P. Heugens et al.  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004  same time it remains somewhat gratuitous to operationalize capabilities by the  results they are supposed to generate – simply because this does not tell us any-  thing about what actually produced the desired organizational outcome R (Priem  and Butler, 2001). To uncover the true essence of organizational capability, we  must therefore establish a plausible chain of events that demonstrates how R could  have been obtained.  Organizational scholars leave little room for doubt as to where this causal chain  should begin: they hold that all organizational outcomes somehow start with indi-  vidual action (Cyert and March, 1963; March and Simon, 1958; Thompson,  1967). Karl Weick puts it as follows: ‘Whenever organizations act – the university  gave tenure, the government negotiated, the bakery searched its memory, the  orchestra enacted chaos – people act. And any assertion that organizations act can  be decomposed into some set of interacts among individuals such that if these  people had not generated and meshed a specific set of their actions, . . . then the  organization would not have performed the act attributed to it’ (1979, p. 34). The  implications of this view for a theory of organizational capability are clear: such  a theory should firmly be rooted in the acts of individuals. But what connects indi-  vidual actions to organizational outcomes?  Rules in Organizations  Like a number of influential scholars before us, we propose that in most organi-  zations decision rules – normative constraints that guide the behaviour of indi-  viduals by determining the relative appropriateness of all the behavioural options  open to them[5] – constitute the primary device for linking the acts of individual  members to organizational results such as R. Weick, for example, writes that all  organizations require ‘assembly rules’ by which individual behaviours are ‘assem-  bled and sequenced to produce an outcome’ (1979, p. 35). Furthermore, Pentland  relies on so-called ‘grammatical rules’ to ‘describe the sequences of actions that  make up organizational processes’ (1995, p. 552). In an analysis of how ‘formal  rules’ govern life in an American research university, March et al. similarly observe  that ‘human actions are organized around rules, and these rules fit together to  create and maintain social systems’ (2000, p. 7). As a final example we point at  DiMaggio and Powell who hold that ‘organized life is explicable’ due to ‘institu-  tional rules’ that ‘constrain individual behaviour by rendering some choices unvi-  able, precluding particular courses of action, and restraining certain patterns of  resource allocation’ (1991, pp. 9–10). In brief, decision rules form an indispens-  able aspect of organizational capability because they connect individual actions to  organizational outcomes. But how do decision rules make this connection?  In order to facilitate organizational action, decision rules must perform three  elementary functions. First, they must overcome bounded rationality problems  (Simon, 1955) that impede the decision-making faculties of individual organiza-  Reputation Management Capabilities 1351  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004  tion members by removing as much as possible the element of active deliberation  from their task-related decisions. Rules ‘cut the Gordian knots’ of decision making  (Perrow, 1972, p. 31) by excluding the particular merits of particular cases from  practical consideration through an a priori specification of what is to be done  regardless of the circumstances of particular cases (Warnock, 1971). Second, deci-  sion rules must offer a remedy to the ‘problem of the utilization of knowledge not  given to anyone in its totality’ (Hayek, 1945, p. 520). The achievement of complex  organizational results requires the simultaneous or sequential execution of many  individual acts, but this synchronized deployment is hampered by the fact that  organizations are distributed knowledge systems lacking an overseeing ‘mind’  (Tsoukas, 1996). Organizations must therefore rely on decision rules for concert-  ing the efforts of multiple collaborating or interdependently operating specialists  (Grant, 1996a, 1996b). Third, decision rules must help organizations solve the  problem of delegating tasks under the condition of incomplete alignment of inter-  ests between the organization and its members (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). Deci-  sion rules can be used to expose individuals to incentives that appropriately induce  them to operate in the organization’s interest (Prendergast, 1999). The following  three sections describe at greater length how decision rules connect individual  action to organizational outcomes by overcoming these three fundamental   problems.  Decision Rules and the Problem of Bounded Rationality  A theory of organizational capability has to be rooted in a view of individual  behaviour that is compatible with the access to information and the computational  capacities individuals possess in the organizational environment in which they have  to operate (Simon, 1955, pp. 99–100). We know that the decision-making ability  of human beings is subject to both limitations and systematic biases (Tversky and  Kahneman, 1974), but this is not a problem per se. Problems only start to arise  when individuals are put in a setting where the complexity of the decisions they  have to make greatly outweighs their cognitive capacities – like in modern orga-  nizations. Three interrelated aspects of modern organizations in particular make  them particularly inhospitable territory for the boundedly rational decision maker.  First, organizations have a strong tendency towards knowledge ossification  (Berman et al., 2002, p. 17) – the routinization of decision processes that were  once deliberate. Ossification processes mean that individuals gradually grow  unaware of the decisions underlying their actions, which means that certain behav-  iours in organizations can long outlive their reasons for being. Second, employees  may have multiple beliefs about the nature of organizational means–ends rela-  tionship without ever being able to know which of these beliefs is most justified  (Weick, 1979). Finally, it may well be that organizational outcomes are not being  produced by a simple and confined set of antecedents, but by literally hundreds  1352 P. Heugens et al.  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004  or thousands of complexly interconnected organizational factors (Dierickx and  Cool, 1989).  To overcome the bewilderment and potential paralysis associated with a mis-  match between environmental complexity and decision-making faculties, organi-  zations must deliver their constituents from the ordeals of choice-based action  (Cyert and March, 1963). Such deliverance requires the stipulation of clear deci-  sion rules that accommodate the impaired decision-maker by specifying ex ante how  that individual is supposed to act, whether or not there is a good reason to act as  such in every case that may be encountered. This allows individuals to root their  behaviour in a decision logic that is neither wilful nor consequential in the normal  sense – the logic of appropriateness (Cyert and March, 1963). This decision logic  does not require individuals to anticipate the consequences of all behavioural  options open to them, but merely asks them to follow a set of rules telling them  which of these options are more appropriate than the others (March, 1994).  Hence, by engaging in a certain course of action individuals do not signal any  attempt to maximize their expected utility, but rather demonstrate their willing-  ness to fulfil the duties assigned to them by some central administration (March  and Olson, 1984). Such rule-following in accordance with the logic of appropri-  ateness is central to the theory of organizational capability we propose here,  because a view on how the problem of bounded rationality can be overcome rep-  resents an important first step toward an explanation of how individual actions  are linked to organizational outcomes.  Decision Rules and the Problem of Coordination  Overcoming the problem of bounded rationality by allowing individual con-  stituents to operate under the logic of appropriateness is a necessary first step  towards an explanation of how organizational outcomes are facilitated by means  of decision rules, but by itself not a sufficient one. This is because organizations  are, in the words of Tsoukas, ‘distributed knowledge systems’ (1996, p. 13) in the  sense that they must somehow utilize knowledge that is widely dispersed over many  individual specialists and that cannot be known or controlled by any individual  mind. In other words, telling organizational members what to do individually  without making an effort to synchronize or otherwise purposefully mesh their joint  knowledge and activities into an integrated whole is unlikely to result in satisfac-  tory organizational outcomes. An observation of this kind has led Robert Grant  to state that ‘the fundamental task of organization is to coordinate the efforts of  many specialists’ (Grant, 1996a, p. 113; see also Demsetz, 1991). In our view, deci-  sion rules play a crucial role in helping organizations overcome the problem of  coordination, because they can act as coordinating mechanisms that integrate the  specialist knowledge of many interdependently working individuals without  wasting too much of their time on cross-learning and communication.  Reputation Management Capabilities 1353  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004  Grant (1996a) has identified a number of such coordinating mechanisms, start-  ing with directives. Specialists can efficiently coordinate their efforts with people  who are specialists in other fields by giving them direct instructions; this relieves  them of the necessity of transferring their knowledge to these individuals by means  of a lengthy training process (Demsetz, 1991). A second mechanism is sequenc-  ing, which involves organizing work activities chronologically so that each specialist  can deliver his or her input to a specific project independently of others (Pentland,  1995). Another option involves the use of routines, which may be defined as ‘rela-  tively complex patterns of behavior . . . triggered by a relatively small number of  initiating signals or choices and functioning as a recognizable unit in a relatively  automatic fashion’ (Winter, 1986, p. 165). These routines act as catalysts for  complex interactions between individuals by increasing the simultaneity of their  behaviour, even in absence of significant communication between them.[6] A final  mode of coordination is group problem solving, which refers to all forms of task  coordination amongst specialists involving consensus-building, personal commu-  nication, and cross-learning. Since this latter mechanism is usually very effective  but rarely very efficient, Grant (1996a) recommends that this form of coordina-  tion be reserved for unusual and complex tasks. These coordinating mechanisms  are at the core of the theory of organizational capability we introduce here,  because an approach to overcoming the problem of coordination represents an  important second step toward an explanation of how individual actions are linked  to organizational outcomes.  Decision Rules and the Problem of Delegation  In our discussion of the problem of bounded rationality, we pointed out that   decision-rules allow individuals to operate in a non-calculative way by enabling  them to model their behaviour after ethical requirements or norms of appropri-  ateness (Frey, 1998). But Sunstein and Ullmann-Margalit (1999) warn us that the  decision to adhere to the logic of appropriateness is not a non-calculative decision  but in fact a rational attempt to reduce the problems associated with on-the-spot  decision making in a later stage. In other words, the a priori decision to act non-  calculatively at a later point in time is a calculative decision, which is made while  the individual is still operating under the logic of consequentialism (Cyert and  March, 1963). Like the problem of bounded rationality, this is not a problem per  se, but it is in fact a problem in modern complex organizations where delegation  relationships abound.  Delegation is the hallmark of modern organization; not just delegation between  owners and professional managers (Berle and Means, 1932), but also amongst and  between managers and employees themselves. Entrusting others with tasks that  otherwise would have had to be performed by the self is perhaps the primary  mechanism that explains the productivity of the modern firm, because it allows  1354 P. Heugens et al.  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004  the leveraging of the diversity of skills in the organizational arsenal ( Jacobides and  Croson, 2001). But delegation also creates potential misalignments of interests  within organizations, because the delegator and his or her delegatees do not nec-  essarily share common objectives (Eisenhardt, 1989a). This is a problem when   delegatees follow the logic of consequentialism to determine whether they should  switch to the logic of appropriateness. Given a discrepancy between their private  interests and those of the organization, rational deliberation on their part may  lead them to the conclusion that it is not in their best interest to blindly follow the  decision rules prescribed to them by the organization.  A realignment of interests between delegator and delegatee therefore has to take  place before individuals are put in the position where they have to choose between  surrendering to the logic of appropriateness and remaining in the deliberative  mode of practical reasoning. This realignment can be accomplished by adopting  incentive systems – composed of decision rules – that reward individuals for rule-  following and penalize them for rule-defiant behaviour (Prendergast, 1999). The  adoption of such incentive rules represents a third necessary step towards a theory  of organizational capability. The three steps we described are jointly sufficient to  explain how individual actions are linked to organizational outcomes, because they  tell organizational members what to do individually, how to coordinate their efforts  with others, and why it is rational for them to do so.  Common Misunderstandings about Decision Rules  These are the contours of our theory of capabilities as decision rules. But before  we proceed by introducing the research project, we will address some common  misunderstandings about decision rules, notably that they are necessarily rigid and  immanently codified. The persisting idea that rules breed inflexibility probably  derives from the influential literature on bureaucratic ‘dysfunctions’ and ‘bureau-  pathologies’ (Blau, 1955; Gouldner, 1954; Merton, 1957). Yet, there is no con-  vincing case to be made for a direct relationship between rule proliferation and  organizational obstinacy. In fact, numerous scholars have pointed at the crucial  role decision rules play in preserving the adaptability and flexibility of organiza-  tions. Eisenhardt and Sull (2001) argue that ‘simple rules’ provide organizations  with the structure to seize business opportunities in turbulent, ever-changing  markets. Similarly, Weick (1998) perceives a crucial link between decision rules and  improvisation in organizations. According to his view, the idea that improvisation  boils down to ‘making something out of nothing’ is astonishingly incomplete. The  true nature of improvisation can only be understood if we acknowledge the fact  that successful improvisers are skilled practitioners who create as well as follow  rules, such that their activity is controlled but not predetermined. For March (Levitt  and March, 1988; March, 1981, 1996), rules are both the medium and the message  of organizational learning. Organizational experiences are recorded in rules to  Reputation Management Capabilities 1355  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004  guarantee their preservation, but such ‘etching’ of experiences in accessible  memory also facilitates their diffusion. People lacking first-hand experience with  certain types of problems can benefit from the knowledge of experienced others  by applying the rules these experts once recorded. In sum, organizational rules are  at the core of various crucial adaptive processes in organizations.  It is also a mistake to presume that organizational rules must necessarily be   codified, as many rules in organizations tend to be unwritten.[7] March et al. (2000,  pp. 18–19) point out that the distinction between written and unwritten rules is  often far from consequential since the commonalities between them are as plenti-  ful as the differences are scarce. First, both types of rules are maintained and com-  municated through socialization. Second, both written and unwritten rules exist  to offset the bounded rationality- and self-interestedness-biases in individual deci-  sion makers. Third, in both manifestations rules can be self-enforcing, provided  that an actor’s compliance is seen as appropriate in the eyes of influential third-  party observers. Finally, all rules reproduce social structure by accumulating ex-  periences over several generations of rule-followers. Hence, codification is not a  necessary characteristic of decision rules.  THE RESEARCH PROJECT  The purpose of this paper is to inductively develop a contextually relevant theory  of organizational responses to reputational threats, following the procedures sug-  gested by the grounded theory approach (Glaser and Strauss, 1967). These pro-  cedures entail a constant comparison between an emerging theory and data  throughout the data collection and analysis process. The unfolding theory acts as  an interpretative lens that highlights the importance of empirical facts and dis-  tinctions, whereas previously gathered data simultaneously focus attention on the  theory’s adequacy as a framework for capturing the relevant dimensions of the  most recent data being collected (Isabella, 1990). The final product of this tran-  sient truce between theory and data should be a conceptualization that accounts  for all relevant nuances in the data.[8]  The empirical basis of this study is a four-year (September 1997–October 2001)  qualitative investigation of the reactions of the Dutch food industry to the intro-  duction of genetically modified food ingredients. With the foods themselves often  being described as ‘Franken-foods’ (Miller, 1992), ‘Über-plants’ (Walsh, 1999), or  ‘Demon seeds’ (The Economist, 1998), this setting easily meets the criteria of an  ‘extreme case’, one in which the need for and the development of reputation man-  agement capabilities is more evident and transparent than in other situations  (Eisenhardt, 1989b). Conceptually, this study builds on the previously outlined  generic theory of organizational capabilities as decision rules, and our ambitions  with this theory are two-fold. First, we strive for an application of the generic  theory in the hope of demonstrating its relevance. Second, we aim for a contex-  1356 P. Heugens et al.  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004  tualization of the generic framework in order to make it more amenable to the  facts of the situation as we found them.  Data Collection  During the research period, we studied the introduction process of genetically  engineered foods in Europe from a variety of different empirical angles.[9] First, to  gather firsthand knowledge of the reputation management capabilities of the firms  in the Dutch food sector, we conducted so-called focused interviews (Merton et al.,  1956) with key players in the biotechnology issue. To obtain data that captured  the greatest possible variation in reputation management experiences, we selected  a group of 23 key players in the issue, following Glaser and Strauss’s (1967) notion  of theoretical sampling in terms of theoretical relevance. More specifically, we  sought variation with respect to the roles these various participants played in the  issue, as indicated by both the nature of the organizations that employed them  and by their job titles. A full listing of our interviewees is presented in Table I.  Secondly, we conducted a large-scale archival study to corroborate our inter-  view findings with objectified printed data. We were allowed access to the archives  Reputation Management Capabilities 1357  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004  Table I. Listing of interviewees  Number Organization Job title  1.

These archives con-  sisted of a broad array of materials, ranging from letters and faxes to industry  crisis plans and consultancy reports. Furthermore, three roundtable discussions  were organized, in which we invited both industry and NGO (non-governmental  organization) representatives to discuss our initial research findings with us. We  were also able to use a collection of audiovisual materials, consisting of every tele-  vision broadcast on Dutch public television ever devoted to the issue. Finally, we  used a number of publicly available resources, such as the Internet, international  magazines, and Dutch newspapers as a back-up, to check whether we had missed  any significant events.  Data Analysis  Obviously, these different lines of qualitative inquiry provided us with more data  than we could use and interpret directly. We therefore sought for a means to pull  the data from these various sources together in a way that would simultaneously  further our understanding of the various reputation management capabilities in  use and reduce the ever-present danger of ‘death by data asphyxiation’ (Pettigrew,  1988; cited in Eisenhardt, 1989b). We decided to use vignettes, ‘focused descrip-  tion[s] of a series of events taken to be representative, typical, or emblematic in  the case [one is] doing’ (Miles and Huberman, 1994, p. 81), as our primary tool  for data reduction and interpretation.  The vignette strategy served three critical purposes. First, we structured our data  collection efforts by using draft versions of these vignettes in the interview process.  This stimulated our respondents to talk about salient themes that emerged in  earlier interviews, and pre-structured our later interviews to facilitate sorting and  coding processes. Second, our vignettes told us when it was time to stop collect-  ing data. After approximately the seventeenth interview a saturation process  started to set in (Glaser and Strauss, 1967), after which very few new facts and  opinions emerged that otherwise would have forced us to substantially rewrite the  vignettes. Third, the little narratives allowed us to validate our research findings  by having them reviewed by a number of key informants (N = 5). The rationale  behind this tactic is that informants and participants may disagree with the  researchers’ conclusions and interpretations, but they may as a rule not disagree  over the actual facts of the case (Yin, 1994). The reviewers that we used to verify  our findings are numbered 1, 2, 5, 13, and 22 in Table I.  FOUR REPUTATION MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES  During the research process, a number of qualitatively distinct types of responses  to reputational threats emerged from the data inductively. We made constant com-  1358 P. Heugens et al.  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004  parisons between these emerging empirical insights on the one hand, and our  generic theory of organizational capability on the other. The initial framework  allowed us to ask our respondents more focused questions during the data collec-  tion period, whereas the insights we gained from these informants permitted us to  apply our framework to the empirical materials we were investigating. This com-  parative process ultimately resulted in four contextualized versions of our generic  framework, each representing a reputation management capability that captured  the essence and explained the tinges of a distinct corporate response. We labelled  these four capabilities as follows: (1) dialogue, (2) corporate silence, (3) advocacy,  and (4) crisis communication.  Dialogue Capabilities  The first reputation management capability we identified allowed managers to  build cooperative and trust-based relationships with a broad range of external con-  stituencies, especially those with non-economic motivations (Heugens et al., 2002;  Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). The managers who took part in the development  and implementation of these dialogue capabilities seemed convinced that they had  to reach out to the critical stakeholders of their organizations in order to avert the  impact of reputational threats. But their jobs were significantly complicated by the  excessive complexity of the environment in which they had to operate. Not only  were they forced to cope with all the multifaceted aspects of organizational life in  general, but also with a multitude of external stakeholders and the often unpre-  dictable interactions amongst those parties (Rowley, 1997).  Given the unusual complexities of their operating environments, it remains  questionable whether any of these managers had the deliberative faculties to  foresee most of the external dynamics that would arise in response to their attempts  at establishing a dialogue. To get their jobs done, many of them therefore switched  from a consequential decision-making mode to an approach based on the logic of  appropriateness (Cyert and March, 1963). Rather than trying to predict the con-  sequences of every decision they made, they chose to adhere to a set of more con-  crete decision rules.[10] These rules, for example, specified that managers should  organize round-table discussions involving all the stakeholders the company criti-  cally depended on. Other rules instructed them to supply key stakeholders with  new information that could be of interest to them as soon as the organization had  acquired and validated it. Some rules even specified that stakeholder views should  be used as direct input for corporate decisions pertaining to the reputational threat  at hand. In combination, these rules enabled the managers in our sample to main-  tain a dialogue with external parties, even if they were unsure at times about the  direct results of their actions (see Table II).  In addition to providing a set of behavioural guidelines for the individual   specialists to follow, reputation management capabilities should also have a   Reputation Management Capabilities 1359  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004  1360 P.

Companies that used the dialogue capability frequently resorted to  group problem solving (Grant, 1996a) as a means of overcoming potential coor-  dination problems. Dialogue decision rules dictated that managers should try to  meet personally with all the parties that could play a decisive role in the evolution  of the reputational threat. Managers also followed guidelines advising them to root  all decisions involving multiple parties in consensus, rather than in persuasion or  coercion. In other words, the dialogue capability also consisted of an additional  set of decision rules stipulating that personal and communication-intensive forms  of coordination were most appropriate (see Table II).  Finally, since not every rule stipulated in organizations coheres well enough with  the interests of individual managers to be followed spontaneously, organizational  capabilities also need to provide and maintain an incentive system that stimulates  rule-following behaviour in accordance with the logic of appropriateness. In case  of the dialogue capability, these incentives were aimed at increasing the likelihood  of managerial behaviour that stimulated better relationships with external parties  by rewarding successful attempts at establishing stakeholder dialogue. At the same  time, the dialogue incentive system also reprimanded behaviour frustrating the  organizational ability to engage in meaningful relationships with outside con-  stituencies (see Table II).  Advocacy Capabilities  The second reputation management capability we uncovered through the present  study was aimed at persuading external audiences that the organizational position  on an otherwise controversial issue was both rationally acceptable and morally  legitimate. The managers exercising these advocacy capabilities believed that they  were justified in using their rhetorical and propagandizing skills to make the orga-  nizations they worked for look better in the eyes of external beholders. Again, it  must not have been easy for these managers to make reliable estimates of the per-  suasiveness of their actions, since the effect of advocacy attempts is not only a  function of the coherence and compellingness of the corporate message, but also  of the number and intensity of dissenting voices in the organizational environ-  ment (Grunig and Grunig, 1992).  An important aspect of these advocacy capabilities is therefore that they  equipped managers with a number of detailed instructions that enabled them to  economize on cognitive effort by allowing them to follow rules in accordance with  the logic of appropriateness. Such rules, for example, instructed managers to  design and implement responses to reputational threats that sought to legitimize  their organizations’ production methods and safety standards in the eyes of con-  sumers. Often they hired specialized corporate communication agencies to provide  the content for these public affairs campaigns. Other rules informed managers on  Reputation Management Capabilities 1361  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004  how to deal with the potential impact of national authorities and the EU govern-  ment on their businesses, and urged them to make extensive use of political mar-  keting tools to present their organizations favourably in these non-market arenas  (Harris and Lock, 1996; see Table III).  In addition to instructing individual managers on what to do under which cir-  cumstances, advocacy capabilities should also provide a solution to coordination  problems that might arise when these professionals try to combine their efforts to  resolve joint problems. Since the development of advocacy-oriented responses to  reputational threats requires the execution of many interrelated but essentially sep-  arable tasks, many organizations using an advocacy approach relied on rules that  prescribed sequenced forms of coordination. Advocacy tasks (such as competitive  intelligence, market research, campaign strategizing, copy writing, and communi-  cation channel management) were typically organized as stand-alone activities, so  that small teams of professionals could work on them separately. These activities  were also organized in time-patterned sequences, so that the output of one group  provided the input for another without there being much need for inter-group  communication and adjustment (see Table III).  A final aspect of the advocacy capability is that it should persuade the man-  agers it addresses to follow the behavioural and coordination rules it prescribes.  To that end, the capability provides incentives to stimulate behaviour that helps to  create a more favourable external image for the organization. At the same time,  it puts sanctions on any display of behaviour that could exert a negative influence  on outsiders’ assessment of the corporation’s actions and decisions (see Table III).  Corporate Silence Capabilities  A third reputation management capability we identified was aimed at avoiding  organizational ‘ownership’ of the reputational threats generated by the introduc-  tion of genetically enhanced foods. For our present purposes, ownership of repu-  tational threats (Oomens and van den Bosch, 1999) may be interpreted as a strong  association in the eyes of relevant publics between an organization and a given  reputational threat, which could potentially lead to additional responsibilities on  behalf of the organization for resolving that threat. The managers using these so-  called corporate silence capabilities tried to keep the company name out of the  public debate as much as possible, in an attempt to avoid their organization and  modern biotechnology always being mentioned in the same breath. The task of  maintaining corporate silence is a very complex one, not only since most of the  structures and processes determining the course of the public debate are not under  corporate control, but also because it is exceptionally difficult to make sure that  none of the organization’s employees breaks the cordon of silence.  Corporate silence capabilities therefore offer managers practical guidelines in  the form of decision rules that minimize the need for on-the-spot decision making  1362 P.

Most importantly, these guidelines tell managers to put all  external communication tasks in the hands of a relatively small number of well-  trained professionals. This centralization rule allows managers to substantially  reduce intra-organizational plurivocity (Thachankary, 1992), and hence to  promote the organizational point of view in a single, unambiguous voice. Other  guidelines supporting the centralization rule prevented non-communication  employees from making public statements and directed information-seeking  outside parties directly to the communication unit of the organization (see Table  IV).  Since corporate silence capabilities depend on the cooperation of many indi-  vidual specialists for their proper functioning, it is essential that they also offer a  solution to coordination problems. The dominant coordination mechanism for this  capability consisted of directives – impersonal standards and instructions regulat-  ing the interactions between individuals (Van de Ven et al., 1976). To overcome  plurivocity, the corporate silence approach first of all required the knowledge of  key communication professionals to be codified in handbooks and manuals. These  internal regulations specified most of the necessary procedures to be followed for  communicating successfully with both employees and outsiders. Furthermore, in  most organizations using the corporate silence approach, all employees except for  designated communication professionals were explicitly instructed not to commu-  nicate with outsiders about current reputational threats. Together, these rules  enabled the organization to present a unified view on modern biotechnology to  the outside world (see Table IV).  Finally, the corporate silence capability also needs an incentive structure to stimu-  late corporate employees to follow the specified decision rules. More than any of  1364 P.

Employees were certainly rewarded for behaviour that reduced the association  between the company and modern biotechnology in the public media, but more  telling were the instances in which employees were fined or even demoted after  presenting their personal opinion on biotechnology in public (see Table IV).  Crisis Communication Capabilities  Crisis communication capabilities allow managers to engage in a purposeful  exchange of information with interested outside constituencies during immediate  reputational threats. Crisis communication is a highly complicated activity because  crises usually leave managers with very little time to respond to the challenges and  critiques of affected stakeholders. Furthermore, firms struck by an immediate rep-  utational threat are typically affected by a number of conditions that hamper their  ability to communicate with outside parties, such as decreased source credibility  (because the organization may be tainted by a regrettable event; Leiss, 1994) and  receiver problems (because affected non-experts cannot be expected to readily  assimilate and understand expert views on what went wrong; Powell and Leiss,  1997). More than any of the other responses to reputational threats, crisis com-  munication capabilities must therefore equip managers with decision rules allow-  ing them to exchange information with affected stakeholders without forcing them  to make difficult on-the-spot decisions.  Most of the decision rules we encountered in organizations relying on crisis  communication took one of three forms. First, many of the organizations in our  sample used rules that stimulated managers to look for ‘weak signals’ in their exter-  nal environment (Ansoff, 1980), because these small stimuli could one day evolve  into significant reputational threats. Second, these organizations tended to have  rules in place that instructed managers how to identify emerging threats rapidly  and to interpret them ‘on automatic’. This type of automatic crisis identification  starts by learning the characteristics of a number of standardized crisis categories  and framing new crises in terms of these archetypical classes as they develop  (Dutton, 1993). Finally, managers that were frequently involved with crisis com-  munication followed rules that instructed them to match certain crisis categories  with standardized, well-learnt responses (Daft and Weick, 1984). In turn, these  responses allowed them to communicate purposefully with affected parties in high-  pressured situations without compromising the organizational position on modern  biotechnology (see Table V).  When an organization is confronted with events that require immediate atten-  tion, coordination problems easily rise to the fore. Due to the heightened time pres-  sure involved, crisis situations usually rule out all possible forms of coordination  1366 P.

What is more, crisis  situations are often too idiosyncratic and arise too unexpectedly to allow for coor-  dination by means of straightforward standard operating procedures. Therefore,  organizations with well-developed crisis communication skills often rely on the rou-  tines of their communication specialists as their principal coordination mecha-  nism. To stimulate routine-based task coordination, organizations often allow their  reputation management professionals to operate in relatively small and stable  groups to stimulate the simultaneity of their actions and decision-making. Because  of their relatively high degree of social cohesion, these groups are able to develop  the routines that allow them to operate as a single-minded ‘pack’ when they are  put under time pressure (see Table V).  Even though providing professional workers with a large degree of autonomy  and the ability to work in small groups can be seen as rewards in and of them-  selves, many of the organizations that relied on crisis communication capabilities  complemented these stimuli with more orthodox incentives. They rewarded indi-  viduals who were responsible for implementing innovations that reduced the orga-  nization’s reaction time with respect to critical reputational threats and penalized  employees who caused unnecessary delays in the process of formulating and imple-  menting responses (see Table V).  Cross-Sectional Analysis  The preceding sections presented the four reputation management capabilities we  encountered in our study of the responses of Dutch food firms to the reputational  threats imposed by the introduction of genetically enhanced foods. These sections  provide us with valuable insights into what capabilities were employed by the firms  1368 P. Heugens et al.  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004  Table V.

To address this  issue, we will present a brief cross-sectional analysis (see Table VI).  We obtained this analysis by juxtaposing the types of capabilities we uncovered  (displayed along the horizontal dimension of Table VI) with the organizations in  our sample (comprising the vertical dimension of this table). For the actual analy-  sis, we used the 14 interview reports we obtained from individuals working for  these organizations. Each of these reports was systematically and thoroughly  examined for evidence of data fitting the four capability categories. In line with a  procedure suggested by Isabella (1990), we extracted verbatim sections from these  reports (paragraphs in which individuals referred to an element or characteristic  of a particular capability), recorded them on separate sheets of paper to represent  the core of an individual’s statements, and coded them into the final categories.  In total, 259 such excerpts were recorded.  The cross-sectional analysis revealed that many organizations relied on multi-  ple reputation management capabilities rather than focusing on a singular  response pattern – five organizations used all four capabilities, two organizations  used three, and one organization relied on only two capabilities. Overall, the orga-  nizations in the sample relied most extensively on dialogue (accounting for 35 per  cent of all coded fragments), closely followed by corporate silence (30 per cent).  Less popular were advocacy (19 per cent) and crisis communication (16 per cent).  But not all organizations in our sample adhere to this pattern.

Included in this analysis are directly involved  business firms and their representative organizations. Excluded are firms without a direct stake in the issue, jour-  nalists, functionaries from the Ministries of Economic Affairs and Agriculture, NGO representatives, and   independent advisors.  The numbers listed in the table correspond to the number of paragraphs from the interview reports in which (ele-  ments of ) a particular reputation management capability was mentioned. Note that we interviewed several people  in some organizations: four at the Product Board for Margarine, Fats, & Oils; three at Unilever; and two at Gist-  Brocades (currently DSM).  nizations in our sample relied predominantly on dialogue (Unilever, Product Board  for Margarine, Fats, and Oils, and Product Board for Grains, Seeds and Legumes),  whereas four others were primarily focused on corporate silence (Numico, Ahold,  Gist-Brocades, and the Standardization Institute). One organization devoted equal  amounts of attention to both capabilities (Product Board for Animal Feed).  But perhaps the most revealing cross-sectional analysis we can perform on this  modest data matrix is an investigation of the dominant response pattern of these  organizations (operationalized as the specific combination of the two capabilities  they use most intensively). Four organizations used a dialogue–corporate silence  response pattern (Unilever, Product Board for Grains, Seeds, and Legumes,  Product Board for Animal Feed, and the Standardization Institute). We could call  this the uncertainty avoider approach to reputation management, because these   organizations prefer to secure matters pro-actively through dialogue and eagerly  avoid ownership of reputational threats. Three organizations opted for an   advocacy–corporate silence response pattern (Numico, Ahold, and Gist-Brocades).  This could be called the opportunistic approach to reputation management, because  these organizations tend to engage in highly vocal corporate propaganda when  the public opinion is temperate, but prefer to take a backbencher’s approach when  the public debate heats up. Finally, one organization chose to go with a dia-  logue–crisis communication response pattern (Product Board for Margarine, Fats,  and Oils). This could be called the maverick approach to reputation management,  because it combines a commitment to pro-active problem-solving through dia-  logue with a certain disregard for ownership of reputational threats in times of  heated public debate.  DISCUSSION  We have previously discussed a number of rules and the capabilities they consti-  tute as we identified them in the course of our empirical work. But this descrip-  tive–analytical exercise has left three questions unanswered. First, pertaining to the  rules, where exactly do they come from? Second, with respect to the capabilities,  why do we see differences across organizations in terms of their dominant response  patterns? Third, related to both rules and capabilities, what are the limitations of  the chosen approach?  Origin of Decision Rules  The organizational literature provides two complementary views on the origin of  decision rules: either rule production is seen as an organization-level phenomenon  rooted in learning or as a population-level process grounded in evolution. Accord-  ing to the first perspective, organizational rules are repositories of organizational  experiences. Organizations create rules when they encounter new problems that  do not seem to be covered by their current repertoire of rules. Rule making  1370 P. Heugens et al.  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004  appears to be a particularly fruitful strategy when such new problems are likely to  be fairly recurrent, consequential, or salient (Schulz, 1998). Of course, not all rule  creation involves organizational learning (Mills and Murgatroyd, 1991) and not all  organizational learning crystallizes in the form of decision rules (March and Olsen,  1988), but a fair amount of all organizational learning consists of encoding infer-  ences from history into decision rules that guide future organizational behaviour  (Levitt and March, 1988). The implication of this first view for the present study  is that reputation management capabilities can be seen in part as the codified sedi-  ment of prior organizational experiences with the management of reputational  threats.  Alternatively, the second perspective suggests that rule formation is largely a  consequence of population-level ecological or evolutionary processes. Nelson and  Winter (1982) have proposed an ecological approach in which organizational rou-  tines are analogously seen as genes – path-dependent and relatively inert triggers  of action in organizations. The gene metaphor suggests that rule change within  organizations tends to be slow relative to the rate of change of the organizational  environment. The diffusion of any set of rules across a population of firms can  therefore not strictly be perceived as a deliberately adaptive process. Instead, this  view suggests that variations in the population-level mix of organizational rules  are the outcome of an ecological selection process of differential organizational  growth and survival (March, 1996). The implication of this second view is that the  reputation management capabilities we identified can in part be seen as the prop-  erties of organizations surviving a shakeout process in which firms equipped with  inferior capabilities were weeded out.  Differences in Organizational Response Patterns  Two independent views may explain why we encountered different organizational  response patterns: we can either perceive of responses as deliberate and voluntary  acts, or as steps that are primarily dictated by the organizational environment   (Hrebiniak and Joyce, 1985). The first perspective suggests that organizations ex-  perience significant strategic choice (Child, 1972), even when they are faced with  reputational threats. This may be the case, for example, when an organization’s  resource dependencies are not very problematic or when it enjoys an influence  over the other organizations in its environment (Emerson, 1962). The strategic  choice perspective predicts that the larger, more powerful players in the modern  biotechnology issue enjoy considerable slack in terms of choosing their desired  response pattern, which implies that they can decide for themselves whether they  want to be ‘mavericks’, ‘opportunists’, or ‘uncertainty avoiders’ (see the cross-  sectional analysis above).  Alternatively, smaller or more dependent organizations are more often forced  to comply with the social norms in the industry and adopt only the response  Reputation Management Capabilities 1371  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004  pattern deemed most appropriate for them by influential observers (Oliver, 1991).  Adaptation under these circumstances is mostly determined from without, as the  environment weeds out maladapted organizational responses and allows only firms  with desired characteristics to remain in business (Aldrich, 1979). The environ-  mental determinism perspective predicts that organizations lacking power or the  leverage of critical resources must very carefully match reputation management  capabilities with reputational threats. Advocacy and dialogue capabilities can be  used for issues, when response time and stakeholder receptivity are in relatively  generous supply. When crises break, corporate silence and crisis communication  capabilities should be used to minimize the risks of wasting time and galvanizing  stakeholders.  Limitations of the Chosen Approach  The findings and implications of this study must be considered in light of its lim-  itations. One limitation of this study is that it is distinctly organizational – as  opposed to strategic – in scope. The study was purposively designed to identify the  types of systematic internal responses organizations develop to protect themselves  against the impact of reputational threats. No effort was made to link these  responses to organizational outcome variables such as financial performance, per-  ceived legitimacy, or corporate reputation. This clearly limits the practical and   theoretical implications of this study, as it does not allow us to comment on the  relative effectiveness of the individual responses and response patterns we identi-  fied. An important avenue for future research could therefore consist of an empiri-  cal test of the performance implications for firms confronted with reputational  threats of adopting the reputation management capabilities we uncovered.  A second limitation of this study is that it is exclusively based on a grounded  theory methodology (Glaser and Strauss, 1967). The main attraction of this  approach is that it allowed us to devise ‘thick descriptions’ of the responses orga-  nizations use to withstand organizational threats, which adds to the novelty and  insightfulness of our findings by unearthing many contextualized, socially em-  bedded facts. The downside of our choice for grounded theory is that this  approach cannot be used to establish the generalizability of our theory of repu-  tation management capabilities as decision rules. An important opportunity for  future research could therefore be to develop a large-scale cross-sectional study  spanning multiple industries and covering several different reputational threats to  assess directly whether our approach is robust enough to explain reputation man-  agement in different settings.  CONCLUSION  A first contribution of this research is that it shows that organizations can develop  up to four qualitatively distinct reputation management capabilities in order to  1372 P. Heugens et al.  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004  protect themselves against the impact of reputational threats. Dialogue capabili-  ties allow managers to build cooperative and trust-based relationships with a broad  range of external constituencies. Advocacy capabilities enable managers to per-  suade external audiences that the organizational position with respect to a con-  troversial reputational threat is both appropriate and right. Corporate silence  capabilities are aimed at avoiding organizational ‘ownership’ of critical reputa-  tional threats. Finally, crisis communication capabilities allow managers to inter-  act meaningfully with affected parties, even under conditions of high adversity and  time pressure.  A second contribution of this paper is that it also shows how the outcomes by  which these capabilities are denoted (dialogue, advocacy, etc) are obtained within  organizations. We propose that capabilities are composed of decision rules, which  fulfil three crucial functions for linking the actions of individual members to orga-  nizational outcomes. Rules circumvent the problem of bounded rationality by  allowing individuals to make decisions according to the logic of appropriateness  rather than the logic of consequentialism. They also solve the problem of coor-  dination by supplying collaborating specialists with a ‘grammar’ for sequencing  and synchronizing their behaviours. Finally, rules offer a remedy for the problem  of delegation by aligning the interests of delegator and delegatee before the latter  is asked to make any decisions. It is important to note that our grounded theory  study of organizational responses to reputational threats has demonstrated the  applicability of this behavioural approach to organizational capability, but it has  certainly not exhausted future research possibilities in this area. We therefore plea  for subsequent studies offering further conceptual refinement and empirical testing  of the decision-rule approach to organizational capability.  NOTES  *We thank Oana Branzei, Hans van Oosterhout, Karen Legge, and two anonymous JMS reviewers  for helping us to improve this paper. Naturally, we assume full responsibility for any remaining errors.  [1] Fombrun and van Riel (1997, p. 10) define corporate reputation as ‘a collective representation  of a firm’s past actions and results that describes the firm’s ability to deliver valued outcomes  to multiple stakeholders. It gauges a firm’s relative standing both internally with employees and  externally with its stakeholders, in both its competitive and institutional environments.’ The  definition we use here is completely in tune with the one proposed by Fombrun and van Riel,  but shorter and more focused on the ‘relative standing’ aspect of corporate reputations.  [2] Consider the following anthology of recent reputational threats: AOL Time Warner’s inflation  of sales by booking barter deals; Arthur Andersen’s shredding of documents after the SEC  launched an inquiry into Enron; revenue inflation through ‘channel stuffing’ at Bristol-Myers  Squibb; Coca Cola’s bungling with a contamination incident in Belgium; Dow Corning and  the issue of leaking breast implants; Enron’s use of off-the-book partnerships to hide debts; the  insider trading scandal at Martha Stewart Omnimedia; Merck’s recording of uncollected con-  sumer-to-pharmacy co-payments; Phillip Morris and the issue of second-hand tobacco smoke;  Qwest Communication’s inflation of revenue through the use of network capacity ‘swaps’; and  WorldCom’s overstating of its cash flow by booking operating expenses as capital expenses.  [3] We thank an anonymous referee for bringing this point to our attention.  [4] Since an explicit aim of this paper is to inductively develop a specific theory of reputation man-  agement capabilities, we need a more generic ‘baseline’ or ‘searchlight’ theory of organiza-  Reputation Management Capabilities 1373  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004  tional capability to guide our observations and interpretations of empirical facts (Popper,  1934/1959). Without some kind of theoretical frame of reference, it would simply be impos-  sible to separate salient from irrelevant observations.  [5] This definition is partially based on Philip Pettit’s (1996) definition of rules: ‘normative con-  straints that determine that one member – or perhaps one subset – of a set of options is more  appropriate in some way than alternatives’ (p. 65). Also see the discussion on the ‘logic of appro-  priateness’ (Cyert and March, 1963) in the present paper’s section entitled: ‘Decision rules and  the problem of bounded rationality’.  [6] Examples offered by Grant (1996a) include the routinized behaviour of surgical operating  teams and auto racing pit crews. Berman et al. (2002) add the example of teams operating in  the National Basketball Association.  [7] Note, however, that unwritten rules are not necessarily tacit in a Polanyian sense (Polanyi, 1962):  they are uncodified but not necessarily uncodifiable. This is significant because researchers can  then study such rules and put them in print, even if an organization abstains from doing so  itself (for examples, see Tables II–V of the present paper).  [8] There is an immanent tension between the depth (contextuality) and breadth (generalizability)  of any theory. The grounded theory methodology tends to generate theories that are highly  contextual, but potentially less generalizable than theories generated by other means. We thank  an anonymous referee for reminding us of this trade-off.  [9] This mode of inquiry, which consists of double-checking findings by using multiple sources and  modes of evidence, has become known as triangulation (Huberman and Miles, 1998). The  origin of the term can be traced back to Campbell and Fiske’s (1959) ‘multiple operational-  ism’ – using multiple measures to ensure that the variance reflected in the dependent variable  derives from the influence of the independent variables and not from the measures in use.  [10] See the discussion section of the present paper for a view on where these rules came from.  REFERENCES  Aldrich, H. E. (1979). Organizations and Environments.

Co-evolution in Strategic Renewal Behaviour of  British, Dutch and French Financial Incumbents:  Interaction of Environmental Selection,  Institutional Effects and Managerial  Intentionality*  Bert Flier, Frans A. J. Van Den Bosch and   Henk W. Volberda  Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam           How do incumbent firms and environments co-evolve and how are   firm-level adaptation and selection at industry level interrelated? Can and do large  established organizations renew themselves to adapt to their environment? Three  single-lens theories, relating to environmental selection, institutional theory,  managerial intentionality, and a co-evolutionary perspective are used to investigate  strategic renewal of incumbent firms. We derive propositions and distinguish between  three dimensions of strategic renewal and develop metrics to investigate our  propositions in a multi-level, multi-country, longitudinal study of the European  financial services industry.  Our results provide the following insights. From an environmental selection  perspective, we found incumbents have a preference for exploitation renewal actions.  Country institutional environments appear to explain to what extent incumbents  prefer internal and/or external renewal actions. Managerial intentionality seems to  explain outlier behaviour and firm-specific frequency and timing of renewal actions.  From a co-evolutionary perspective, interaction effects explain deviations from  predictions derived from the single-lens theories applied in this paper.

We analyse these questions in a multi-  country, multi-level, and longitudinal investigation of the European financial   services industry.  The financial services sector in the European Union (EU) is well suited for study-  ing co-evolutionary processes at the industry, institutional, and firm level of analy-  sis, as these levels capture ‘the promise and the empirical challenge of conducting  coevolutionary research’ (Lewin and Koza, 2001, p. vii). This sector experiences  major technological developments at industry level. Substantial and identifiable  changes in EU and national regulations impact at institutional level. At firm level,  we focus on large, long-lived established financial services firms in the EU of which  strategic renewal actions will be investigated.  We use three single-lens theories and a co-evolutionary approach to explain  strategic renewal of incumbents. By developing propositions and metrics that  address three levels of analysis, we seek to appreciate the value of these theories  and of the addition of a co-evolutionary perspective. The propositions and metrics  will be illustrated in a qualitative empirical analysis of the content, context, and  process dimension of strategic renewal actions of incumbent financial services  firms including their interaction effects. The empirical set-up should be designed  in such a way that these interaction effects are revealed (Volberda and Lewin, this  issue). We therefore use both a longitudinal and cross-section design at the indus-  try, country, and firm level, with appropriate metrics (McKelvey, 1997) to relate  these levels.  Many publications on co-evolution have a conceptual nature (e.g. Lewin and  Volberda, 1999; McKelvey, 1997) and most empirical contributions use a case  study approach in which narration and a historical analysis are applied (e.g. Carney  and Gedajlovic, 2002; Djelic and Ainamo, 1999; Huygens et al., 2001; Jones,  2001). The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this literature by developing  metrics that link actual renewal actions of firms, and by explaining renewal actions  as resulting from interaction effects of environmental selection, institutional effects  and managerial intentionality (Lewin and Volberda, 1999).  A CO-EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE: ENVIRONMENTAL  SELECTION, INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS, AND MANAGERIAL  INTENTIONALITY  Co-evolutionary theory argues that the concurrent operating of adaptation and  selection explains processes of change and renewal. As such, our theoretical basis  is derived from theories that address selection processes, institutional effects and  managerial intentionality (Lewin and Volberda, 1999; Volberda et al., 2001). We  choose the population ecology and the institutional approach to investigate envi-  ronmental selection and institutional effects, and the strategic choice and dynamic  2164 B. Flier et al.  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  capabilities approach to analyse managerial intentionality. Below, we will discuss  these four theoretical lenses, and develop four propositions.  According to population ecology (Carroll and Hannan, 2000; Hannan and  Freeman, 1977, 1984), large organizations are well suited to exploit today’s  markets, but their build-up inertia makes adaptation to the future difficult. Change  occurs at the population level through a continuous process of variation, selection,  and retention, during which environmental forces select organizations that fit the  resource base of an environmental niche best (Hannan and Freeman, 1977). Orga-  nizations that are reliable, accountable, and reproducible (Hannan and Freeman,  1984) will be favoured in the selection process. Organizations that survive the selec-  tion process will in turn increase their level of structural inertia. As the environ-  ment changes, the inertness of these organizations results in deteriorating  performances. Aldrich (1979, 1999) and Hannan and Freeman (1984) argue that  this structural inertia is difficult to overcome, resulting in eventually selecting out  firms whose competencies have become outdated. New organizations that emerge  over time ultimately replace the current organizational population. Recent con-  tributions of population ecologists (Barnett and Burgelman, 1996; Baum and  Singh, 1994) point out organizations can to some extent adapt to the environment  if that environment is relatively stable. In times of radical change the organiza-  tional population will generate a variety of strategies, of which only some will  prove to be successful. Firms who have tried a different strategy have to comply  with this dominant strategy; otherwise they will be selected out. However, varia-  tions in new strategies result from a random process and no single firm can con-  sistently create the dominant strategy. As time goes on, this process eventually  results in an alteration of the composition of the organizational population.  Arguing from a population ecology approach, organizations are structurally  inert and slow to change (Hannan and Freeman, 1984). Individual attempts to  renew decrease firm survival chances, while high reliability, accountability and  reproducibility increase survival chances (Hannan and Freeman, 1989). Therefore,  the renewal patterns of firms within a particular industry will be predominantly  characterized by exploitation actions. In times of high rates of environmental  change, this theoretical lens suggests incumbent firms should exploit their niche.  The impact of environmental selection on incumbents’ strategic renewal, there-  fore, suggests the following proposition:  Proposition 1: From a population ecology approach, to achieve high reliability,  accountability and reproducibility, incumbent firms pursue exploitation actions  over exploration actions in their strategic renewal behaviour.  Institutional theory examines the influence of the institutional context on the orga-  nizational structure (Scott, 2001; Tolbert and Zucker, 1996; Wicks, 2001). Orga-  Co-evolution in Strategic Renewal Behaviour 2165  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  nizations are more homogeneous than unique because of coercive, normative, and  mimetic isomorphism (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). Mimetic isomorphism may  result in bandwagon pressures (Abrahamson and Rosenkopf, 1993), according to  which strategies diffuse through an organizational field once a strategy is perceived  to be legitimate (Meyer and Rowan, 1977). This so-called ‘old institutionalism’  (Greenwood and Hinings, 1996) is not known for explaining change due to a   lack of explanations of the internal dynamics of change in organizations. Neo-  institutional theory has a less static approach. According to neo-institutionalists,  the embeddedness of organizations in their institutional context is a basic reason  for resistance to change. The more organizations are coupled to a prevailing   organizational template in a highly structured institutional context, the higher the  resistance to change, and the more radical organizational responses to drastic envi-  ronmental changes. In addition, the pace of change is contingent on the differ-  ences in structures of distinct institutional sectors. That is, organizational change  varies across institutional sectors. Internal dynamics of organizations are the reason  for differences in the pace of change within sectors. In an uncertain environment,  changes in the power structure and competing ideas result in different strategic  thinking, which gives rise to the emergence of new strategies. Thus, changes also  vary within sectors (Greenwood and Hinings, 1996).  Institutional pressures may lead organizations to adopt initiatives undertaken by  other organizations in their institutional environment. This process of institutional  bandwagon effects explains the phenomenon that a significant number of orga-  nizations in institutional settings undertake similar types of initiatives. As the  number of organizations that adopt the initiative increases, the initiative becomes  value infused. Organizations that do not adopt the initiative risk loss of stake-  holders, in particular of shareholder support, which may lead them to adopt the  innovation after all (Abrahamson and Rosenkopf, 1993). In this connection, Scott  (2001) emphasizes the impact regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive insti-  tutional factors have on organizations. Greenwood and Hinings (1996) also   recommend a fast follower strategy to achieve long-term survival to prevent   firms from drifting away from the prevailing institutional template. Institutional  effects on strategic renewal actions of incumbents firms suggest the following  proposition:  Proposition 2: From an institutional approach, incumbent firms will mimic the  renewal actions of other firms in their institutional environment, which results  in similar strategic renewal behaviour.  The strategic choice approach (Child, 1972, 1997; Miles and Snow, 1978) endows  organizations with a capacity to change their destiny by adapting themselves and  reshaping their environments. This approach emphasizes the importance of man-  agerial intentionality of decision makers being the intermediary between organi-  2166 B. Flier et al.  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  zations and their environments. Child (1972, 1997) attributes decision makers  some managerial leeway regarding environmental factors, performance standards,  and organizational design. Few organizations function at the limits of their effi-  ciency (Cyert and March, 1963), resulting in organizational slack allowing in-  cumbents to meet short-term performance needs (Schiff and Lewin, 1970) and  enabling multiple forms of organizations to be viable in an environment.  Teece (1984) has argued that a limited repertoire of available routines severely  constrains a firm’s available strategic choices. Firms develop core rigidities together  with highly specialized resources in order to enhance profits, however at the price  of reduced flexibility (Volberda, 1996). Wernerfelt (1984) pointed at the possibil-  ity of managerial action to develop new capabilities. Consequently, Teece et al.  (1997) argue that the firm must remain in a dynamic capability-building mode,  which is an organization’s latent ability to renew its core competence. According  to this dynamic capabilities approach, an organization should retain its capacity to  renew, augment, and adapt its core competence over time.  Firms try to escape the competence trap by remaining in a dynamic capability  building mode and continuously renew themselves by exploring opportunities  arising in their environment (Teece et al., 1997). This approach is based on orga-  nizational learning and focuses on how organizational members notice and inter-  pret information and knowledge and use it to reconsider the fit of firms with their  environment (Best, 1990; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Van Den Bosch and Van  Wijk, 2001; Van Den Bosch et al., 2003). In reconsidering this fit, a firm’s absorp-  tive capacity plays an important role (Lewin et al., 1999). A firm’s absorptive  capacity influences the expectation formation process and its exploration/exploita-  tion balance (Van Den Bosch et al., 1999, 2003). Cohen and Levinthal (1990, p.  137) suggested that the higher the absorptive capacity, the more likely it will be  that a firm’s aspiration level or expectation formation process will be defined in  terms of environmental opportunities, independent of current performance crite-  ria such as profitability. Cohen and Levinthal (1990) even suggest that firms with  higher levels of absorptive capacity will tend to be more proactive: fortune favours  the prepared firm (Cohen and Levinthal, 1994). From a knowledge-based and  dynamic capability perspective on managerial intentionality, we therefore expect  the pattern of strategic renewal actions of firms to be firm specific regarding the  timing, frequency and volatility of strategic renewal actions.  Proposition 3: From a managerial intentionality approach, renewal actions of incum-  bent firms will show firm-specific patterns regarding the temporal dimension of  strategic renewal behaviour.  Lewin and Volberda (1999, p. 526) define co-evolution ‘as the joint outcome of  managerial intentionality, environment, and institutional effects’. McKelvey (1997)  suggests co-evolution as one of four frontiers to attack the idiosyncrasy problem  Co-evolution in Strategic Renewal Behaviour 2167  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  in organization science. Lewin et al. (1999, p. 535) emphasize that a co-  evolutionary perspective ‘considers organizations, their populations, and their  environments as the interdependent outcome of managerial actions, institutional  influences, and extra-institutional changes’. Co-evolution can be studied on  varying levels of analysis. Baum and Singh (1994) propose that changes may occur  in all organizations or populations that interact. McKelvey (1997) distinguishes  between micro- and macrocoevolution. Microcoevolution refers to co-evolution  within firms (Barnett et al., 1994), whereas macrocoevolution takes place between  firms and their niche.  Interaction effects between levels of analysis are a key phenomenon to be  studied in co-evolutionary research. Lewin and Volberda (1999) mention mutual,  simultaneous, lagged, and nested effects, which most likely are not linear and   may lead to counterintuitive outcomes because of feedback loops. McKelvey  (2002, p. 1) points out that co-evolution ‘approximates a mutual-causal, deviation-  amplifying, positive feedback process (Maruyama, 1963)’, in which A reacts to B,  and B to A, and so on, until halted by a damping mechanism. This study builds  on Lewin and Volberda’s (1999) definition of co-evolution as the joint outcome of  managerial intentionality, institutional, and selection effects. We operationalize co-  evolutionary effects by considering the interaction effects that stem from feedback  relations between organizations and environments (Baum and Singh, 1994; Lewin  and Volberda, 1999).  The previous three propositions are based on single-lens theories. In a co-  evolutionary approach, however, strategic renewal actions are analysed as the joint  outcome of environmental selection, institutional effects and managerial inten-  tionality (Lewin and Volberda, 1999). The outcome of co-evolutionary processes  of strategic renewal will deviate from the predictions derived from the single-lens  theories because of interaction effects between multiple levels of analysis.  Proposition 4: From a co-evolutionary perspective, interaction effects of industry selec-  tion, country institutional effects and managerial intentionality at firm level  explain deviations of strategic renewal behaviour of incumbent firms from pre-  dictions derived from single-lens theories.  METRICS TO CONNECT THE INDUSTRY, INSTITUTIONAL, AND  FIRM LEVEL IN PROCESSES OF STRATEGIC RENEWAL  We defined strategic renewal as strategic actions to align organizational compe-  tencies with the environment to increase competitive advantage. Our propositions  and strategic renewal definition require metrics that connect the industry, institu-  tional, and firm level in strategic renewal processes. To this end, we distinguish  between three dimensions of strategic renewal (cf. Volberda et al., 2001) – the content,  context, and process of strategic renewal – and develop metrics for each of these  2168 B. Flier et al.  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  dimensions. The exploration/exploitation ratio relates to the content dimension.  The ratio of external to internal strategic renewal actions addresses the context  dimension. The process dimension refers to the temporal character of strategic  renewal and covers the timing, frequency, and volatility of strategic renewal  actions. These metrics allow observing both uni-directional and multi-directional  causalities in trajectories of strategic renewal and linking multiple levels of  analysis.  March’s (1991) conception of exploration and exploitation gives rise to our first  metric. This metric, the exploration/exploitation ratio, is defined as the number of  exploration actions divided by the total number of strategic actions over a time  period. Exploitation concerns refinement and efficiency, which relates to environ-  mental selection. Exploration ‘includes search and variation’ (March, 1991, p.  71). Environmental selection theories emphasize that successful firms undertake  similar strategic renewal activities and aim their actions at strengthening and  exploiting existing core competencies. This contrasts to theories focusing on   managerial intentionality, which suggest that firms may adapt by behaving   differently and exploring new competencies. We assume, therefore, that strategic  actions resulting in exploration are more related to managerial intentionality. As  the balance of exploration to exploitation actions is linked to changes in the pop-  ulation of organizations (Levinthal and March, 1993; Lewin et al., 1999; March,  1991), this metric also signals multi-directional causalities (Volberda and Lewin,  this issue).  We propose the ratio of external to internal strategic renewal actions as a second  metric. This metric is defined as the number of external strategic renewal actions  divided by the total number of actions over a time period. External actions involve  parties outside a firm’s boundaries in implementing renewal actions, and include  mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, and cooperative agreements. Internal actions  take place within the firm, comprising greenfield investments, the launch of a new  line of services, and rationalizations. The process of importing external business  units into the organization, or selling internally developed units to other organi-  zations, also links the intraorganizational and interorganizational level of analy-  ses. Institutional approaches highlight isomorphism regarding internal and  external renewal actions of incumbents in the same institutional context.  The third metric relates to the temporal dimension, i.e. the timing, frequency, and  volatility of strategic renewal actions. In hypercompetitive environments, success  is often tied to speed (D’Aveni, 1994). Typically, managers act prudently and wait  until environmental turbulence reaches a critical threshold before responding,  which often results in organizational inertia (Hambrick and D’Aveni, 1988). Proac-  tive strategic acting suggests managerial intentionality, whilst concurrent or  delayed acting can be related to institutional theory and environment selection.  We assume firm specific timing, frequency or volatility to indicate managerial   intentionality.  Co-evolution in Strategic Renewal Behaviour 2169  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  METHODOLOGY  During the past decades, the European financial services industry has experienced  a series of environmental and institutional jolts that altered the selection environ-  ment. To approximate these higher-level changes, we follow Haveman et al. (2001)  and investigate the impact of regulatory and technological changes across coun-  tries. We investigate the pace of diffusion of these changes by determining the year  of implementation of European Union (EU) banking regulations, and of signifi-  cant technological innovations across five European countries.  Firm level changes are assessed by the three metrics discussed above. To empir-  ically assess the first metric, renewal actions of financial incumbents were coded  for exploitation or exploration. Following March (1991), exploitation actions are  defined as strategic renewal actions that elaborate on the current range of activi-  ties and fall within the current geographic scope, or that rationalize activities.  Exploitation actions include cost savings, the dissolution of a range of products,  sale of activities, and actions aimed at increasing the scale of the activities per-  formed. We define exploration actions as strategic renewal actions that add new  activities to the current repertoire of the organization and/or that increase the  geographic scope of the firm. Examples are banks entering insurance, or the  expansion into a new geographic region. The latter often requires new compe-  tencies to cope with new business practices, knowledge about clients, etc. (Sivula  et al., 2001).  We derived our second metric by coding strategic renewal actions as being exter-  nally or internally driven. Internal actions originate from within the firm, such as  starting up new businesses, closing offices, reorganizing activities, and job cuts.  External actions are undertaken in conjunction with other organizations and  include mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, and alliances. The third metric relates  to the temporal dimension of strategic renewal, i.e. the timing (in which year a  particular action took place), frequency (the number of renewal actions per year),  and volatility (i.e. standard deviation) of strategic renewal actions.  Sources of Data  The data regarding the timing of regulatory and technological developments is  based on Gual (1999) and on secondary data. To overcome the problems of inter-  views, which risk retrospective sense making (Weick, 1988; Weick and Daft, 1983),  the data collection strategy of strategic renewal actions intended to find contem-  poraneous accounts of actions of renewal. We thus chose to examine publicly  available data to track down contemporaneous accounts of strategic renewal  actions. Annual reports and the Financial Times served as our sources to detect  strategic renewal actions. These sources report on actions from both an inside  2170 B. Flier et al.  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  (company) and an outside (Financial Times) perspective, which overcomes potential  biases of using just one source. We chose the Financial Times above potentially more  detailed national sources (e.g. the Dutch Financieele Dagblad) to prevent differences  stemming from using different sources for each of the countries, and to overcome  linguistic problems. Other arguments for using the Financial Times are its European  focus and its extensive electronic database, which goes back as far as 1990.  We investigated our data using the NUD*IST (Non-numerical Unstructured  Data Indexing, Searching, and Theorizing) software. In comparison to manual  coding procedures, the use of NUD*IST results in a more consistent, more   rigorous breakdown of large files of data into an overview of strategic renewal  actions. This method supports the categorization of large amounts of information  from various data sources. In line with Barr et al. (1992), samples of actions were  used to ascertain intercoder reliability. We recognize, however, that there are poten-  tial biases in our data and we will address these in the concluding section. We  investigated strategic renewal actions of British, Dutch, and French financial ser-  vices companies. Table I provides key data about these firms. We examined the  period 1990 to 1997, which spans a period of increasing turbulence for the finan-  cial services industry.

MACRO-COEVOLUTION: INCREASING ENVIRONMENTAL  SELECTION PRESSURES AND DECREASING INSTITUTIONAL  EFFECTS  We assess changes in environmental selection pressures and national institutional  effects by analysing how and, in particular, when EU banking regulations and tech-  nological innovations in providing bank services were implemented in five EU  countries; France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom during  the period 1972–99. This analysis provides the context of our investigation of  strategic renewal behaviour of European financial incumbents and is used for the  selection of countries in the empirical section.  Pace of Diffusion of Changes in EU Regulations  The process of deregulation and harmonization in the European financial services  sector has been a gradual one and has varied considerably across European coun-  tries. We focus on three main categories of regulatory changes aimed at: (1) eliminating  restrictions to domestic competition; (2) increasing the scale and scope of finan-  cial activities; and (3) improving the external competitive position of financial firms  (Gual, 1999).  We study the first category by comparing the dates on which capital flows, which  limit foreign competition (Gual, 1999), and interest rates were deregulated. The  first mover country regarding interest rate deregulation was the UK (1979), two  years later followed by the Netherlands. The UK also moved first in liberalizing  capital flows, closely followed by the Netherlands. France and Italy lagged almost  ten years in both the deregulation of interest rates and the liberalization of capital  flows. These late movers followed a more gradual policy of deregulating interest  rates and liberalizing capital flows (EFB, 1999). For both regulatory indicators, we  calculated the average time lag per country (see Table II).  The second category comprises indicators on the relaxation of regulations that  limit the scale and scope of financial services. These include restrictions on cross-  border establishment and limits on combining banking, insurance, and securities  activities within a single firm (Gual, 1999). The effectuation of the First and  Second Banking Directive were important indicators in expanding the scale and  scope of financial activities. France, the Netherlands and the UK implemented the  First Banking Directive in 1980. Italy, the UK and the Netherlands were the first  to implement the Second Banking Directive. France followed one year later.  Sweden lags in implementing the Banking Directives because of its late entrance  to the European Union. Table II depicts the results.  The third category comprises the implementation period of harmonization of  prudential regulations across the five EU countries. Prudential regulation includes,  amongst other things, legislation on solvency ratios and the definition of own funds  2172 B. Flier et al.  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  (Gual, 1999). The starting dates of the implementation process range between  1989 and 1991. A notable exception is the United Kingdom, which had already  started in 1985. Four countries finished implementation of prudential regulation  in 1995. Italy finished two years earlier. The establishment of the European Mon-  etary Union (EMU) and the introduction of the Euro took place without any dif-  ference in time lag between the countries investigated. The results presented in  Table II indicate decreasing average diffusion times during the research period,  highlighting increasing convergence in the institutional environment of the five  countries.  Pace of Diffusion of Technological Developments  Technological developments are a major selection force (Haveman et al., 2001;  Spedale, 2003) and have had a substantial impact on the European financial ser-  vices landscape. Based on Flier et al. (2001), we investigated the pace of diffusion  of the implementation of technological developments along five related technological  innovations (see Table II). The establishment of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)  networks is the first indicator. The first ATM network, Bankomat, was founded in  1972 in Sweden. Italy followed 11 years, and France 12 years later. In the Nether-  lands, Rabobank, ABN, Amro, NMB, and Van Lanschot formed an ATM network  in 1985. In the UK, the Link network was founded in 1986. This resulted in an  average time lag per country of about ten years (see Table II).  Co-evolution in Strategic Renewal Behaviour 2173  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  Table II.

(2001), Table 1.  The second innovation, EFTPoS (Electronic Fund Transfer at the Point of Sale),  is ‘an electronic payment method involving goods and services being paid for at  the point of sale through electronic debit of the customer’s account’ (Essinger,  1999, p. 70). In France, the CB network was founded in 1984, consisting of an  ATM and EFTPoS network. The UK’s first debit card payment system Switch  was founded in 1988. The Dutch did not introduce their EFTPoS network PIN  until 1990.  The third innovation is the e-purse, a substitute of cash. The Netherlands was  the first country to launch an e-purse trial in 1989. The Netherlands was also the  first country to introduce a nationwide e-purse scheme, called Chipknip, in 1996.  The Mondex card was introduced in the UK in 1995 with a trial undertaken in  Swindon. The French acquired the licence for the latter card, which was intro-  duced in 1999. The average time lag per country of this indicator is about six  years (see Table II).  The fourth innovation is remote banking. We split up remote banking into three  different types: telephone banking, PC banking, and Internet banking (cf. Daniel  and Storey, 1997; Taylor, 1998). Swedbank first introduced telephone banking in  Sweden in 1985. First Direct was the first to offer a complete banking service in  the UK via the telephone in 1989. In France, Paribas first offered this service in  1990. In the Netherlands, the Postbank (part of ING) started offering a telephone  banking service called Girofoon in 1993. Of the five countries, the UK pioneered  PC banking in 1985. Of the Dutch incumbents, ING followed one year later. BNP,  the French bank, introduced BNP Micro in 1994. The time lags in the diffusion  pattern of Internet banking are much shorter than in telephone and PC banking.  Sweden first introduced Internet services in 1995, followed one year later by the  Netherlands and Italy. France and the UK enabled Internet banking in 1997.  Table II shows the resulting average time lags.  Our final indicator is the establishment of the first branchless bank in a country.  In 1989, First Direct in the UK was the first branchless bank of the five countries  we investigated. In 1994, Banque Directe of BNP was founded in France, while  ING established ING Direct as a branchless bank offering complete banking ser-  vices in 1996. This indicator results in an average time lag of about five years (see  Table II).  Pace of Diffusion: Decreasing Institutional Effects and Increasing  Environmental Selection Pressures  Table II shows increasing speeds of diffusion of the regulatory indicators from an  average time lag per country of about 6–7 years to an average time lag of about  0–1.6 years for the most recent changes. A similar pattern emerges from the dif-  fusion of technological developments. These preliminary results suggest increas-  ing selection pressures. On the other hand, the influence of the national  2174 B. Flier et al.  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  institutional context on financial incumbent firms appears to be decreasing. The  national institutional context, however, remains an important factor. We accumu-  lated the time lags in relation to the first mover country in the diffusion of regu-  latory changes and the time lags in relation to the country of the first mover firm  in implementing technology changes of each country (see also Flier et al., 2001).  The UK heads in the pace of diffusion of regulatory changes, closely followed by  the Netherlands. Firms in Sweden are early in diffusing technological develop-  ments, followed again by British and Dutch firms. France and Italy are late movers.  Sweden’s timelag in diffusing regulatory changes results from its late entrance to  the European Union.  Our analysis suggests at least two findings. First, the pace of diffusion of regu-  latory change and technological developments was on average the highest in the  British and Dutch financial services environment. France and Italy were late  movers. This suggests that the Netherlands and the UK can be considered as  examples of first mover countries, and France as a late mover. These countries  provide an interesting research context for exploring the relationship between  managerial intentionality of firms and environmental selection and institutional  effects. The second finding relates to the decrease of country institutional differ-  ences in the pace of diffusion, whilst selection pressures increased.  CO-EVOLUTION ON FIRM LEVEL: STRATEGIC RENEWAL  BEHAVIOUR OF BRITISH, DUTCH, AND FRENCH FINANCIAL  INCUMBENTS  We start our analysis of renewal actions of financial services firms by presenting  aggregated data on country level to investigate how financial incumbents combine  external versus internal renewal actions. Table III displays eight-year averages of  the average external/internal actions ratio of the Dutch, French and British  incumbents investigated. Dutch incumbents appear to have a preference for exter-  nal over internal actions. About 60 per cent of the actions were externally ori-  ented. French incumbents are on average more balanced in using external and  internal actions of renewal. UK firms show a different pattern. On average, only  one quarter of their actions was externally oriented.  Table III also shows the average exploration/exploitation ratios. The Dutch,  French, and UK firms appear to have comparable average exploration/exploita-  tion ratios. In all three countries exploitation actions by far out number the explo-  ration actions. Both the Dutch and UK incumbents appeared to have on average  80 per cent of their actions focused on exploitation. French companies averaged  about 70 per cent over the research period.  To investigate the frequency of strategic renewal actions, we present data on  the average number of renewal actions per year over the time period 1990–97 in  Table IV. These data illustrate significant differences in the average number of  Co-evolution in Strategic Renewal Behaviour 2175  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  renewal actions per year, or firm specific average frequency of strategic renewal  actions undertaken by the incumbents investigated. Tables V and VI present the  eight-year averages and standard deviations of respectively the external/internal  actions ratio and the exploration/exploitation actions ratio of the thirteen sample  firms. We use the standard deviation as an indicator of the volatility of strategic  renewal behaviour. The standard deviations of external/internal ratios indicate  that some firms, like Barclays and SocGen, have had a more stable pattern of  strategic renewal actions than others, such as Fortis and UAP. The standard devia-  tions of the exploration/exploitation ratios also indicate varying levels of volatil-  ity across the incumbents with high levels of Dutch financials Aegon, Fortis and  2176 B.

Two  firms, ING and Société Générale, however, appear to have a two times higher  exploration/exploitation ratio.  CO-EVOLUTIONARY INTERACTION EFFECTS: INDUSTRY  SELECTION, COUNTRY INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS, AND  MANAGERIAL INTENTIONALITY  This section addresses co-evolutionary dynamics, and investigates the interaction  effects of industry selection, country institutional effects, and managerial inten-  tionality in strategic renewal processes. We investigate co-evolutionary dynamics in  three ways. First, we study the link between the country institutional and firm level  by investigating the connection between the speed of implementing regulatory  changes and the pace of implementing technological changes by the incumbents  operating in those countries. Second, we concentrate on one country and investi-  gate differences in the diffusion of four technologies among the five largest incum-  bents in the Netherlands. We finally focus on the firm level and investigate the  coevolutionary path of the genesis and development of the Dutch largest incum-  bent (ING) and the Dutch financial regulatory and supervisory structure.  We will focus on how across the three countries the pace of implementing regula-  tory changes relates to the speed of implementation of technological innovations  by incumbent firms. We expect that incumbents in first moving countries regard-  ing regulatory changes implemented new technologies faster compared to slower  moving countries to cope with increasing levels of competition.  Figure 1 depicts the first-moving incumbent in implementing technological  innovations associated with remote banking and in establishing a branchless bank.  From the technology indicators used in Table II, we selected these innovations to  exclude innovations that involved ‘collective’ renewal actions that included bank  consortia, such as the introduction of the Electronic Fund Transfer at the Point  Co-evolution in Strategic Renewal Behaviour 2177  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  Table VI.

As Figure 1 indicates, UK and, to a lesser extent, Dutch incum-  bents appear to implement technological innovations prior to French incumbents.  This suggests that incumbents in first mover countries regarding regulatory  changes are likely to move first as well in implementing technological innovations.  Such a connection between implementation speed of regulatory and technologi-  cal changes may result in positive feedback effects. Countries with first movers in  implementing technological innovations may be influenced by these first movers  and their stakeholders to speed up regulatory change to enable the next techno-  logical innovation.  We now focus on one country to investigate co-evolutionary dynamics and inter-  action effects. We selected the Netherlands for reasons of data availability and  because we could investigate all five large Dutch incumbents (with a combined  market share of about 90 per cent). Figure 1 illustrates that ING moved first in  four out of the five technological innovations. A case in point is the introduction  of the e-purse in the Netherlands. The e-purse case illustrates cross-industry inter-  action effects between the banking and telecom industries, the role of mavericks  2178 B.

First mover incumbents regarding the implementation of five technological innovations in  France, the Netherlands and the UK (1985–99)  in developing a financial services technology, and exemplifies how interactions  between financial services incumbents and other players can drive technological  developments.  A Dutch bank consortium (including ING) moved first in implementing the   e-purse (see Figure 1), a technology in which the Netherlands was first in Europe.  In 1989, a consortium including all major Dutch banks, consumer organizations  and retailers undertook a chipcard trial in Woerden, but decided not to pursue  this technology. An attempt to commercialize the e-purse by PTT Telecom, the  Dutch telephone operator, in the early nineties failed. Eventually, in 1995 a con-  sortium of large Dutch banks, including ING, developed the Chipknip – the Dutch  e-purse. ING’s Postbank left the consortium within a month as it decided to pursue  a more innovative e-purse strategy. It linked up with PTT Telecom and developed  the Chipper. As an example of mutual-causal interaction effects, the remaining incum-  bents speeded up the rollout of the Chipknip and introduced it at the end of 1996.  Postbank and PTT Telecom introduced the more sophisticated Chipper in the  second half of 1997 (BIS, 2000), which urged the Chipknip consortium to improve  the functionality of their product. Both the Chipknip and Chipper however had  moderate success. Chipper and Chipknip jointly promoted the use of both e-purse  systems, signed an interoperability agreement, and eventually integrated the two  e-purse systems in 1999 (De Vries and Nielen, 2001).  This case illustrates how managerial intentionality of PTT Telecom and ING  accelerated the introduction of the e-purse and took its functionality to a higher  level. As an example of the feedback mechanism of firm-environment relations  (Baum and Singh, 1994), these first mover incumbents subsequently influenced the  selection pressures on other incumbents.  We will zoom in on the case of the Dutch ING to address the firm level. We will  illustrate interaction effects between its strategic renewal behaviour and changes  in the Dutch financial regulatory and supervisory structure. In the late eighties,  innovative Dutch financial services firms increasingly integrated banking and  insurance activities. These developments induced the Dutch government to lift the  ban on combining banking and insurance operations from 1 January 1990. As an  example of the feedback mechanism of firm-environment relations, Dutch insurer  Nationale Nederlanden and NMB Postbank were already proactively negotiating  a merger to establish the Internationale Nederlanden Group (ING). This merger  was completed in March 1991. ING was the first of the major Dutch incumbents  in implementing the concept of integrated financial servicing. Concurrently, the  regulatory and supervisory systems are changing again. According to the 1990  change in regulation, banking and insurance activities should be legally separated.  However, as integrated financial institutions like ING gradually dissected their  operational structure from their legal structure, two problems arose. First, it  became increasingly difficult for Dutch regulatory agencies to supervise the for-  merly sectorally separated financial activities. Second, it also became problematic  Co-evolution in Strategic Renewal Behaviour 2179  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  for large integrated companies to cope with conflicting claims of these separate  agencies. Therefore, in July 1999, the Dutch Board of Financial Supervisors was  founded to add a cross-sector perspective to the sectoral supervisory model.  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  This explorative paper applied three complementary single-lens theories and a co-  evolutionary perspective to develop four propositions. We designed novel metrics  to investigate environmental selection, institutional effects, managerial intention-  ality, and co-evolutionary interaction effects at three levels of analysis. At the indus-  try and country level, we analysed the impact of major technological innovations  and changes in EU regulations to assess the development of changing selection  pressures and the importance of country institutional effects. We then analysed  three dimensions of strategic renewal behaviour of a sample of 13 financial incum-  bent firms. We now discuss our findings, indicate limitations and suggest issues for  further research.  Environmental Selection and Strategic Renewal  Two findings relate to the selection perspective. First, incumbent firms show rather  similar exploration/exploitation ratios (see Table III). Exploitation actions by far  outnumber the exploration actions in the three countries investigated. This sug-  gests strong selection pressures regarding exploitation and exploration as predicted  by population ecology, illustrating Proposition 1. This is remarkable since the  incumbents investigated (see Table I) include insurance companies like Aegon and  Prudential, banks like Barclays, and integrated financial services firms such as ING,  which are rooted in different regulatory and national environments, and have dif-  ferent path dependencies. From a population ecology perspective, incumbents  appear to prefer leveraging their routines and resources (exploitation actions) above  changing the routines and developing new resources and competencies (explo-  ration actions) in coping with organizational inertia (Hannan and Freeman, 1984)  and maintaining fit with their selection environment.  Selection forces ‘arise from the constraining role played by cultural elements,  such as symbols, cognitive systems, and norms and rules’ (Aldrich, 1999, p. 49).  Regarding these cognitive systems, Weick (1979) suggests that managerial beliefs  can be inferred from actions. To the extent this is the case, the incumbent firms  investigated may share a common industry recipe (Spender, 1989), dominant   logic (Prahalad and Bettis, 1986), or top management mindset regarding explo-  ration/exploitation renewal actions (Barr et al., 1992). We did not investigate  whether the causes of similarity stem from common dominant logics, similar top  management mindsets regarding exploration/exploitation actions, or in features  commonly ascribed to strategic groups (McGee and Thomas, 1986; Peteraf and  2180 B. Flier et al.  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  Shanley, 1997). The firms investigated, however, are all financial incumbents that  share a common industrial context, the EU financial services industry. The impact  of variation in national selection environments on the prevailing management  logics regarding exploration/exploitation in the financial services sector thus  appears to be limited (Dijksterhuis et al., 1999).  Institutional Effects on Strategic Renewal  The second finding deals with country institutional effects on the context dimen-  sion of strategic renewal of incumbents. These country differences regarding  external/internal ratios may be the result of the distinct economic and institutional struc-  ture of the financial services sector in these countries. The Dutch financial services  industry was much more concentrated than the British industry. If Dutch com-  panies wanted to grow, external actions abroad offered more opportunities than  internal or external actions in their domestic market. British financials were con-  fronted with a different climate. In the early nineties, the British financial players  had to overcome a troublesome period caused by an economical slowdown,  leading to restructuring operations, which are typically internal actions. The  French sector represents a mix of the Dutch and British national circumstances.  Overall, this second finding illustrates Proposition 2.  Managerial Intentionality and Strategic Renewal  Focusing on differences at firm level, Table VI indicates that ING and Société  Générale have significantly higher average exploration/exploitation ratios. This  suggests these firms possibly have a higher absorptive capacity than the other  incumbent firms. Firms with higher levels of absorptive capacity tend to consider  opportunities in their environment independent of current performance criteria  in their industry, which might result in higher exploration/exploitation ratios. This  facilitates managerial intentionality, which is reflected in more proactive strategic  behaviour regarding the changing selection environment (Van Den Bosch et al.,  1999, 2003). Regarding Proposition 3, ING and Société Générale could be inter-  esting examples of managerial intentionality regarding the content dimension of  strategic renewal.  The findings regarding the process dimension of renewal actions suggest that  financial incumbents appeared to have their own timing of renewal actions (see  also Figure 1). In the Netherlands, ING was a first mover in creating particular  resource configurations in its strategic renewal trajectory, which contributed to its  competitive advantage (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). The firms also differed  markedly in terms of the frequency of renewal actions (see Table IV). Incumbents  further diverged with respect to the standard deviation of both ratios, indicating  firm specifics in terms of the volatility of strategic renewal patterns. In conclusion,  Co-evolution in Strategic Renewal Behaviour 2181  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  the incumbents investigated seem to have had sufficient slack to allow for, and use,  different timing and frequency of actions of renewal. Moreover, two incumbents  seem to have deviated by exploring the environment to a greater extent than their  competitors, which suggests incumbents can overcome structural inertia and still  be viable. These observations indicate managerial intentionality at firm level and  suggest evidence regarding Proposition 3.  Co-evolutionary Interaction Effects and Principles of  Self-renewing Incumbents  Explaining strategic renewal behaviour of financial incumbents using a selection,  institutional, or managerial intentionality approach offers partial explanations.  Depending on the level of analysis and point of view taken, Propositions 1, 2 and  3 can all be illustrated within the corresponding theoretical approach. The previ-  ous section, however, illustrates co-evolutionary interaction effects in three com-  plementary ways. Each addresses interaction effects within and between several  levels of analysis. Our study shows that co-evolutionary interaction effects play a  significant role in understanding strategic renewal behaviour. With regard to  Proposition 4, our research indicates that interaction effects based on a co-  evolutionary perspective can explain deviations of observed renewal actions from  predictions derived from these theories.  As co-evolution ‘is at the root of self-organizing behaviour’ (McKelvey, 2002,  p. 1), it is important to reflect on how our findings contribute to the understand-  ing of self-renewing organizations. In this connection, Volberda and Lewin (this  issue) raise the important question of how to become and sustain a self-renewing  organization and identify three overarching principles. The first principle relates to  managing ‘the internal rates of change’. Enabling strategies can drive momentum  and early mover behaviour. The second principle is ‘optimizing self-organizing’.  Managing the rate of internal growth through innovation is a key enabling strat-  egy, and suggests that forms of decentralized structures are associated with this  principle. Their third principle highlights the necessity of synchronizing concur-  rent exploitation and exploration (March, 1991). This principle requires slack  resources to enable exploration and pursuing multiple strategies in which parallel  exploring may take place. Do the findings of this paper provide empirical evidence  of these three key principles in the context of self-renewing incumbents?  To address this question, we relate the three principles to our findings of the  strategic renewal of the Dutch incumbents. The first principle about internal rates  of change and early mover behaviour implies relatively low external/internal  ratios (i.e. internal renewal actions outnumber external ones). As indicated above,  ING had the lowest external/internal ratio of the five Dutch incumbents, and is  first mover in implementing technological innovations in the Netherlands (see  Figure 1). The second principle stresses the importance of internal growth through  2182 B. Flier et al.  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  innovation and of forms of decentralized organizational structures. Again, ING  has the lowest external/internal ratio and the highest exploration/exploitation  ratio of the Dutch incumbents. Furthermore, ING has a decentralized structure  (Volberda et al., 2001). Due to large-scale merger and acquisition processes, ING  emerged as a collection of unconnected divisions, each of which is subject to its  own selection environment. The third principle, which regards synchronizing con-  current exploitation and exploration and pursuing multiple strategies, can partly  be illustrated by the ING case. ING has by far the highest exploration/exploita-  tion ratio of the Dutch incumbents (see Table VI). Its exploration/exploitation  ratio, however, was not stable during the research period. ING’s on-line financial  services strategy is an interesting example with regard to pursuing multiple strate-  gies that foster parallel exploration. Major divisions, such as ING’s Postbank and  Nationale Nederlanden, developed their own on-line strategies. Only very recently  top management began emphasizing the necessity of creating an ING-wide Inter-  net portal. In sum, the empirical evidence provided here shows that our metrics  can be helpful in further exploring self-renewing organizations and in opera-  tionalizing the three principles.  Limitations and Issues for Future Research  No study is without limitations. As our regulatory and technological indicators are  primarily related to the banking industry, developments in the insurance and secu-  rities industries were largely kept out of the analysis. Furthermore, we limited   our analysis to two major selection forces, regulatory and technological changes.  This excluded other major influences including globalization, changing demo-  graphics and consumer preferences, disintermediation, and changing corporate  governance.  Another limitation concerns potential biases in our data. Strategic renewal  actions were measured in terms of their number and not their magnitude. Weigh-  ing renewal actions in terms of their magnitude, however, was not possible. The  Financial Times and the Annual Reports of the incumbents investigated do not sys-  tematically report the present, let alone the expected future impact or conse-  quences of these renewal actions. We expect, however, marginal activities are less  likely to be reported than those of greater significance. As the marginal projects  of the investigated firms are subject to the same potential bias, and since actions  are evaluated in terms of their ratios rather than counts, interpretation problems  caused by this potential bias are largely avoided.  A first suggestion for future research is to investigate in greater detail the two find-  ings discussed above: (1) the exploration/exploitation ratio seems to a large extent  to be determined by the industry selection environment; and (2) the external/inter-  nal ratio appears to be influenced by the institutional environment. Second, in  future research it is important to develop methodologies that measure strategic  Co-evolution in Strategic Renewal Behaviour 2183  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  renewal actions by their magnitude including the impact on the ratios as presented  in this paper. Another important issue is to incorporate new entrants into the  coevolutionary analysis. We mainly focused on financial incumbent firms and  excluded new entrants. These new entrants may be either brand new entrants or  incumbent firms from another industry, such as the ICT industry. We expect that  interaction effects of industry selection, institutional effects and managerial inten-  tionality will give rise to a coevolution of both incumbents and new entrants, which  might increase the average exploration/exploitation ratio of financial incumbents  (Hensmans et al., 2001). Introducing new entrants in a more encompassing co-  evolutionary analysis enables the investigation to what extent new entrants are  related to damping mechanisms being mechanisms that influence the rate of co-  evolution (McKelvey, 2002). Future research could also include case studies of  outlier companies in terms of the three dimensions of strategic renewal. These  case studies could contribute to the understanding of the managerial, organiza-  tional and knowledge process factors and the role of leadership that enable and  inhibit self-renewing organizations. We already indicated the absorptive capacity  construct and its expected relation with proactive behaviour (Van Den Bosch et  al., 1999, 2003) could be helpful in such an endeavour. Finally, it is interesting to  investigate to what extent CEO changes and changes in the composition of the  Top Management Team will have an impact on the speed of a firm’s co-evolution.  In conclusion, how does this paper contribute to answering questions related to  the ‘Beyond Adaptation versus Selection’ theme (Volberda and Lewin, this issue)?  We hope that our analysis shows that a co-evolutionary approach is fruitful to over-  come the partial explanations of single-lens perspectives. In previous research on  this topic similar conclusions have been reached. Our study, however, has at least  three contributions. First, we proposed to use metrics linking strategic renewal  actions of firms to environmental selection, institutional effects and managerial  intentionality. Such metrics have been lacking up till now. Second, we showed that  single-lens perspectives cannot explain co-evolutionary interaction effects operat-  ing between different levels of analysis in the empirical world. Third, in a more  detailed empirical analysis for one incumbent firm, it appeared these metrics  provide preliminary evidence for the three principles that Volberda and Lewin (this  issue) associate with self-renewing organizations.  Reflecting on these contributions, we suggest that co-evolutionary research can  make progress in three ways. First, researchers have to investigate other single-lens  theories to assess selection, institutional effects and managerial intentionality in co-  evolutionary dynamics. Second, and even more important for building co-  evolutionary theories, is the development of conceptual metrics, such as those   presented in this paper, to link multiple levels of analysis. Third, these metrics can  be applied in quantitative research to explore the nature and types of co-  evolutionary interaction effects and of principles of self-renewing organizations.  2184 B. Flier et al.  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003  By combining these efforts, co-evolutionary theory building and empirical research  will make progress.

How knowledge accumulation has  changed strategy consulting: strategic  options for established strategy  consulting firms  Frans A. J. Van den Bosch, Marc G. Baaij* and Henk W. Volberda  Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands    There is considerable research evidence to confirm that the accumulation of knowledge  contributes to the competitive advantage of firms. However, in strategy consulting, one  of the most knowledge-intensive professional services, established firms that exploited  their knowledge accumulation by adding exploitative consulting practices have found  their performance has deteriorated.    The increasing share of exploitative practices in the strategy consulting industry has  attracted both established ICT-related consulting firms and new entrants.Moreover, it has  enabled clients to expand their problem-solving abilities. These developments, in terms  of competitiveness and client competencies, have reduced the attractiveness of exploita-  tive practices for established strategy consulting firms.    To analyse this development and to provide strategic options for the established firms, a  conceptual framework is proposed. Based on this framework three strategic options are  identified: ‘follow the herd’, ‘become ambidextrous’ and ‘back to the original focus’. In  summarizing our argument, we highlight the pros and cons of these options and the  implications for senior management.  Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Although established  strategy consulting firms were successful for a  long time, they now face serious problems.  Previous research by Wright and Kitay (2002)  in this journal found that the performance and  legitimacy of management consultants had  come under some pressure. The established  strategy consulting firms are also threatened  by changing client demand and new competi-  tors.

E-mail: mbaaij@fbk.eur.nl  Introduction  There is considerable evidence to suggest that  the accumulation of knowledge contributes to  the success of firms (Grant, 1996; Van den  Bosch et al., 2003). Paradoxically, in strategy  consulting, which is one of the most knowl-  26 Frans A. J.Van den Bosch et al.  The performance and  legitimacy of management  consultants had come  under some pressure  Similarly, The Economist (2002: 61) con-  cluded that, ‘the strategy consulting industry  is wasting away’.  What then has caused this parlous situation  for the established strategy consulting firms?  This question is not only relevant to the con-  sultancies concerned, but also for their clients  and for the practitioners and scholars engaged  in the strategy field. As the core product of  strategy consulting is knowledge, we use a  knowledge-perspective in investigating this  question. By doing so, we hope to contribute  to previous research on management consult-  ing (e.g. Perren and Atkin, 2000; Kipping and  Engwall, 2002; Armbrüster and Kipping,  2003). We focus on the impact of knowledge  accumulation on the strategy consulting indus-  try in general and on the position of estab-  lished strategy consulting firms in particular.  We also discuss briefly the strategic renewal  options of these firms (Volberda et al., 2001a).  Our analysis is based on both public and  company data. Interviews were also con-  ducted with partners in strategy consulting  firms during the period 2003–2004.  The paper is structured as follows. First, we  describe how knowledge accumulation by  established strategy consulting firms has  induced exploitative and hybrid consulting  practices and we suggest a conceptual frame-  work to investigate this development. Second,  in illustrating the framework we show how  these exploitative and hybrid consulting prac-  tices attracted both established IT-related   consulting firms and new entrants to strategy  consulting. Third, we examine how clients  benefited from knowledge accumulation by  strategy consulting firms and subsequently,  increased their ability (Sanchez et al., 1996) to  solve their own problems. Finally, in terms of  strategic change, we discuss the options for  the established strategy consulting firms and  the implications for top management.  Distinguishing between explorative,  exploitative and hybrid consulting  practices  In strategy consulting, as in any professional  service, a spectrum of key benefits that clients  seek can be identified. This spectrum ranges  from creativity to improving efficiency,  depending on the particular type of problem  experienced by the client (e.g. Maister, 1993).  Clients’ problems range from those that are  new to the strategy consulting firm, to prob-  lems that are familiar to them. This distinction  is relevant because different client problems  require different consulting practices. From a  knowledge-perspective, we can distinguish a  spectrum of consulting practices related to dif-  ferent kinds of clients’ problems.  Following March (1991), who introduced  the distinction between exploration and  exploitation activities in organizational learn-  ing, exploration includes activities such as  search, experimentation, discovery and inno-  vation, while exploitation involves imitating,  refining and adapting existing knowledge.  Applied to consultancy practices, explorative  consulting practices are about creating knowl-  edge that is new for the consulting firm.  Exploitative consulting practices are associ-  ated with leveraging existing knowledge  known to the consulting firm. Exploitative  practices focus on efficiency in knowledge  processes and may utilize ‘routine recipes’ as  opposed to ‘deep strategic thinking’ in explo-  rative practices (Franklin, 2001). Explorative  and exploitative consulting practices, there-  fore, require different resources such as using  senior consultants, a different number of  (junior) consultants per partner (leverage), dif-  ferent organizational structures and different  leadership styles. These differences are in line  with the literature on the organizational and  managerial implications of performing explo-  rative and exploitative knowledge activities in  firms (Benner and Tushman, 2003). During  Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strategic Change, Jan–Feb 2005  one of our interviews, a partner in an explo-  rative practice pointed out the difference in  leverage between both practices:  We do not have any juniors working  around here.We have principals and direc-  tors. The experience base of a principal  would be around ten years . . . and for  partners let us say five years plus.There are  no juniors. There are no graduates. So the  bottom large two layers of the pyramid  structure of the exploitative practice are  not present in our company.  Figure 1 provides an overview of the spec-  trum of consulting practices that range from  explorative to exploitative types including the  associated main characteristics of the practice  and managerial and organizational require-  ments.The requirements to deliver explorative  versus exploitative consulting practices are  quite different. Hybrid practices consist of a  mixture of both explorative and exploitative  practices. To simplify Figure 1, these practices  are not included.  The impact of knowledge  accumulation on the strategy  consulting industry and established  strategy consulting firms  In emerging professional service industries,  most projects will be new for the service firms  as well as for their clients.This results in a sub-  stantial demand for explorative practices.  However, when the professional service firms  gain experience and accumulate knowledge,  client problems will become increasingly  familiar. Client problems that previously  required an explorative approach can now be  solved through a hybrid or exploitative one.  The accumulation of knowledge by the pro-  fessional service firms through learning from  client projects expands the range of problems  familiar to these firms at the expense of   problems that are new to them.

To illustrate the main argument of the paper,  we introduce a conceptual framework  inspired by Maister (1993). The framework  (see Figure 2) depicts the development of the  share of explorative, exploitative and hybrid  practices in the total number of client projects  completed within the industry. Due to the  ongoing process of knowledge accumulation  and other related drivers of change to be dis-  cussed below, this development results in a  declining share of explorative practices and a  rise in the share of exploitative and hybrid  practices. At the start (T1 in Figure 2) of a pro-  fessional service industry such as strategy con-  sultancy, almost all problems will be new to  the professional service firm. At time period  T1, therefore, the share of explorative prac-  tices will be around 100%. However, due to  accumulation of knowledge by the consulting  firms, the share of problems that are new to  them and hence the share of the explorative  practices will decline. At time period T2 the  share of the explorative practice has declined  from about 100% to A%, while the share of the  exploitative practice has risen from about 0%  to C%. The hybrid practice has increased to  B%.  As the range of client problems familiar to  established strategy consulting firms increased  over time, the shares of exploitative and  hybrid practices increased accordingly (see  Figure 2). In this connection a partner with  one of the established strategy consulting  firms pointed out in an interview:  For each client assignment we have analo-  gies at our disposal . . .

A partner with another consulting firm  referred to explorative practices when he told  us:  Where-ever you look for inspiration, you  have to go beyond the normal bounds of  what everybody is studying normally in  your industry and you have to combine  that information to stimulate thinking  about what happens.  These two quotations illustrate the principal  difference between both practices as depicted  in Figure 1. Exploitative practices use, to a  large extent, ‘commodified’ knowledge bases  while explorative practices are conducted by  senior consultants that do not rely extensively  on these knowledge bases.  Entering the growing market segment of  exploitative practices was attractive for the  established strategy consulting firms as it  allowed these firms to leverage their knowl-  edge bases accumulated during past projects.  These consulting firms responded to the trans-  formation of their industry by adopting a strat-  egy of broadening their scope of practices.  However, not all established firms adopted this  approach. Some established top tier strategy  consulting firms retained a focus on their tra-  ditional explorative practices.  To illustrate the conceptual framework (see  Figure 2) regarding knowledge accumulation  by the established strategy consulting firms   of a particular business problem, we use the  example of business process re-engineering  (BPR). In the first half of the 1990s, the impor-  tance of BPR was recognized and the required  new knowledge was created to address the  associated problems for clients. In that period  BPR was to a large extent an explorative prac-  tice. By the turn of the millennium, BPR  became a familiar issue for strategy consulting  firms and hence evolved into a hybrid or  exploitative practice. This development is   supported by a study regarding established  strategy consulting firms indicating the use   of ‘strikingly similar’ methods and tools for  business process re-engineering (Werr et al.,  1997). ICT-based knowledge management   has enabled the development of exploitative  consulting practices, the commodification of  knowledge and attracted new entrants.  The increasing use of exploitative and  hybrid practices by established strategy   consulting firms required Information and  Communication Technologies (ICT)-based  knowledge management. To benefit from the  accumulated knowledge, ICT increasingly pro-  vides the ‘production technology’ that strategy  consulting firms rely upon for exploitative  practices (Sarvary, 1999). Consulting firms  have been among the first businesses during  the 1990s to make heavy investments in ICT-  based knowledge management (Hansen et al.,  1999). These technologies facilitate the codifi-  cation, storage, access and dissemination of  explicit knowledge within the consulting firm.  Explicit knowledge relates to knowledge that  can be easily codified, i.e. written down in  documents and placed into databases. Con-  trary to explicit knowledge, tacit knowledge  resides in the heads of individual consultants  and cannot be easily codified. Using this   type of knowledge for explorative practices,  networks of professionals who can be  approached for their tacit knowledge are  required (Hansen et al., 1999).  In a further attempt to capture and leverage  the accumulated explicit knowledge, some  strategy consulting firms attempted ‘commod-  ification’of this knowledge.‘Commodification’  is the term used to describe the transformation  of unstructured problems and solutions into  standardized problems and solutions (e.g.,  Elkjaer et al., 1991). These firms have ‘pro-  grammed’ knowledge in procedures, methods  and tools that could be stored in their ICT-based  knowledge management systems. The ‘com-  modified’, or ‘packaged’, approach is typical of  the exploitative practice (see Figure 1).  Robust and easy to handle procedures,  methods and tools increase the efficiency of  the consulting practice and can be adminis-  tered by junior (less expensive) consultants  (Ernst and Kieser, 2002). Commodification  Strategic options for strategy consulting firms 29  Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strategic Change, Jan–Feb 2005  30 Frans A. J.Van den Bosch et al.  therefore enables the increase of leverage.  Moreover, the commodified approach to strat-  egy consulting knowledge offers the strategy  consulting firms advantages in the marketing  of their services (Ernst and Kieser, 2002). With  regard to Figure 2, commodification induces  the growth of the exploitative practices  segment at the expense of the hybrid practices  one. The increasing importance of ICT-based  knowledge management in strategy consult-  ing, however, has changed the trend of com-  petition within the industry. As Sarvary (1999:  97) has observed:  Originally, the consulting firm’s proposi-  tion was to provide a resource: smart  people to solve the client’s problem . . . It   is no longer enough . . . The firm must  demonstrate the power of its collective  knowledge base.  The growth of exploitative consulting   practices and in particular the emergence   of commodification of strategy consulting  knowledge, has lowered entry barriers and  made the strategy consulting industry increas-  ingly attractive to new exploitative players.  Typically, these entrants used a strategy of  commodifying knowledge to ‘colonize’ strat-  egy consulting (Suddaby and Greenwood,  2001). In terms of Figure 1, these firms  entered at the right side of the spectrum  which corresponds to the exploitative prac-  tices segment in Figure 2. Both focused spe-  cialists and large (ICT-related) consulting firms  have entered strategy consulting during the  past decade. Compared to the established  strategy consulting firms, the large ICT-related  consulting firms have a number of competitive  advantages in the exploitative practice  segment: (1) their larger scale, (2) their ability  to combine strategy and ICT, and (3) their  ability to implement solutions.  Knowledge accumulation of strategy  consulting firms has increased  clients’ problem-solving abilities  Knowledge accumulation and commodifica-  tion on the part of the established strategy  consulting firms has influenced the ability of  their clients to improve problem-solving by  themselves (Sanchez et al., 1996). Instead   of hiring strategy consulting firms as was   customary in the past, clients increasingly  conduct their own consulting activities. To  investigate which consulting practices were  affected, we have identified two approaches of  clients to absorb part of the accumulated  knowledge from established strategy consult-  ing firms. In this connection, we propose to  distinguish two basic strategies of clients: (1)  those attempting to learn from previous con-  sulting projects and (2) those hiring ex-  consultants. Using the first approach, clients  use the consulting firms’ solutions, proce-  dures, methods and tools to address repeated  or similar problems. This client strategy nega-  tively affects the demand for exploitative prac-  tices of consulting firms.  Using the second approach, large client  firms hire ex-consultants or alumni from the  same strategy consulting firms they used to  hire for solving problems. Clients use the  knowledge and problem-solving skills of the  alumni to solve their problems instead of  hiring the consulting firms.The level of senior-  ity of the alumni influences which consulting  practices will be affected. Due to the pyrami-  dal structure and the ‘up or out’ career policy  of most established strategy consulting firms,  we may expect most alumni to be juniors. The  hiring of junior alumni by clients will therefore  mostly affect the exploitative practices of strat-  egy consulting firms. Regarding this second  client strategy, a partner in a strategy consult-  ing firm pointed out in an interview:  There are far more alumni consultants  [from the established strategy consulting  firms] working at customers’ firms than  there are working at the consulting firms  . . . There are so many ex-consultants   with clients that they can do that [the rela-  tively low value-added consulting work]  themselves.  Overall we expect that exploitative prac-  tices of consulting firms will be most vulnera-  Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strategic Change, Jan–Feb 2005  ble to the spillover of accumulated knowledge  from strategy consulting firms to clients. In  relation to Figure 2, we expect that the knowl-  edge spillover to clients inhibits the growth of  the industry segment, particularly in respect  of exploitative practices.  Strategic options for established  strategy consulting firms  Established strategy consulting firms that  broadened the scope of their practice by  adding exploitative and hybrid practices now  face a potentially threatening situation. These  firms have moved from a traditional focus   on the segment of explorative practices to a  broader scope that includes all three segments  (see Figure 2). By expanding beyond their tra-  ditional scope of explorative practices, they  have entered into consulting practice seg-  ments that have become less attractive.  Established strategy  consulting firms now face  a potentially threatening  situation  Besides competing in increasingly less  attractive practice segments, the competitive-  ness of established strategy consulting firms is  hindered by the issue of managing multiple  consulting practices within one firm with   conflicting requirements (see Figure 1). The  conflicting requirements of explorative and  exploitative practices in terms of resources,  organizational structures, incentives and lead-  ership, frequently create severe internal ten-  sions (Maister, 1993; Benner and Tushman,  2003). Broadening their scope, these firms are  neither focused explorative nor exploitative  players, but become ‘stuck in the middle’. The  challenge of these firms is to try to combine  both practices in a way to improve their com-  petitive advantage, that is by adapting an  ambidextrous organizational form. Ambidex-  trous firms try to reconcile the tension  between the conflicting managerial and   organizational requirements of performing  both exploitation and exploration activities  (Birkinshaw and Gibson, 2004). The ‘stuck in  the middle’ firms are therefore threatened by  the existence of focused competitors. In the  explorative segment they face established  strategy consulting firms that restrict them-  selves to the original focus (that is explorative  practice), and in the exploitative segment they  are confronted by ICT-related consulting firms  and other new entrants that focus on exploita-  tive practices.  These competitive threats suggest various  options. Based on Figures 1 and 2, we identify  three strategic options for established strategy  consulting firms: (1) the ‘follow the herd’  option; (2) the ‘become ambidextrous’ option,  and (3) the ‘back to the original focus’  option.  In the ‘follow the herd’ option, the estab-  lished strategy consulting firms continue to  follow the industry through its life cycle by  adding exploitative practices to an increasing  extent. This option implies that established  firms participate in each of the three practice  segments. ‘Following the herd’ behaviour by  large established firms can be observed in  other industries as well (e.g., Volberda et al.,  2001b; Stienstra et al., 2004). This option,  however, does not seem to be viable in the  long run. Competing successfully in the  exploitative and hybrid practice segments will  be especially difficult because of the develop-  ments in terms of client self-consulting capa-  bilities and new entrants. If the established  firms want to compete in the exploitative  segment with these newcomers, they need to  overcome their competitive disadvantages.  Developing scale and building the capabilities  for implementation and for combining strat-  egy and ICT will require major investments   by the established firms, and this takes time.  Furthermore, the conflicting organizational  requirements of the three practices will   undermine the competitive advantage of the  established strategy consulting firms in all   segments.  Strategic options for strategy consulting firms 31  Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strategic Change, Jan–Feb 2005  32 Frans A. J.Van den Bosch et al.  The ‘become ambidextrous’ option means  the established strategy consulting firms  combine both explorative and exploitative  practices to enhance their competitive advan-  tage and performance. To this end, top man-  agement has to create the right framework for  resolving issues of conflicting organizational  and managerial requirements (Volberda,  1998). Birkinshaw and Gibson (2004) have  identified two distinct, but complementary,  organizational forms of ambidextrous organi-  zations. First there is structural ambidexterity,  which is the creation of separate organiza-  tional structures within a firm. For example, a  business unit focusing on exploratory and  another business unit on exploitative prac-  tices. Top management decides about the   necessary organizational structure and the   relative importance of both practices and  defines the management roles. This form of  ambidexterity is characterized by top-down  decision-making.  The second is contextual ambidexterity,  which allows systems and organizational struc-  tures to be more flexible and is characterized  by less top-down and more decentralized   decision-making. Such an organizational con-  text allows knowledge workers ‘to use their  own judgement as to how they divide their  time’ between exploratory and exploitative  practices (Birkinshaw and Gibson, 2004:  49). According to these authors, contextual  ambidexterity requires knowledge workers  that are multi-taskers, brokers of information  and knowledge, and have a cooperative atti-  tude. Creating an organizational context  enabling contextual ambidexterity is difficult  and therefore hard to imitate. Table 1 illus-  trates both forms of ambidexterity. In examin-  ing both forms of ambidexterity from the  knowledge perspective outlined in this paper,  we believe the contextual ambidexterity form  appears to be the most promising in terms of  creating and sustaining a competitive advan-  tage for strategy consulting firms.  The ‘back to the original focus’ option  implies that established strategy consulting  firms with a broad scope attempt to reduce  their activities to their original focus on explo-  rative practices. With reference to Figure 2,  this option implies that these firms withdraw  from the exploitative practice segments in par-  ticular. This option will result in a significant  downsizing of current businesses of the estab-  lished strategy consulting firms and in a reduc-  tion of their leverage. Such a reduction often  has a substantial impact on both the firm’s  revenue as well as income per partner.  We have so far assumed that established  strategy consulting firms remain independent.  If this is the case, the first strategic option in  particular will require substantial investments  and time consideration to match the scale and  abilities for implementation, and also for com-  Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Exploitation, exploration and ambidextrous organizations  • To survive in dynamic and competitive environments, ambidextrous organizations need to reconcile  exploitation and exploration activities as two contradictory organizational processes by implementing particular  managerial and organizational requirements (March, 1991; Adler et al., 1999; O’Reilly and Tushman, 2004).  • Two complementary forms of ambidexterity:  Structural ambidexterity: Contextual ambidexterity:  How achieved?

However,  established strategy consulting firms may also  consider alliances and mergers with new  entrants that already possess such abilities.  Conclusion  Considerable evidence suggests that knowl-  edge accumulation contributes to the com-  petitive advantage of firms. However, in  strategy consulting, established firms that  exploited their accumulated knowledge now  face some major challenges. An explanation  for this paradox is that many strategy consult-  ing firms have adopted a strategy of adding  exploitative and hybrid consulting practices to  their traditional scope of explorative practices.  By broadening their scope these firms have  become ‘stuck in the middle’ as they have  failed to address the conflicting requirements  of explorative and exploitative practices. Fur-  thermore, the exploitative practices sector  appears to have lost its potential attractiveness  because both clients and new competitors  have exploited the results of knowledge accu-  mulation by strategy consultancy firms.  As the conceptual framework depicted in  Figure 2 shows, knowledge accumulation, the  emergence of ICT-based knowledge manage-  ment and the commodification of knowledge,  the increasing tendency of clients to solve  their own problems and the arrival of new  entrants, constitute major drivers of change.  Confronted with such changes, top manage-  ment of those firms that are ‘stuck in the  middle’ face the choice of at least three strate-  gic options: (1) ‘follow the herd’, (2) ‘become  ambidextrous’, and (3) ‘back to the original  focus’.  From the knowledge perspective taken in  this paper, we suggest that firms seeking to  become ambidextrous offer the best hope of  attaining sustainable competitive advantage.  This is the most demanding, difficult to imitate  and therefore potentially the most rewarding  of the three options. This option enables the  established strategy consulting firm that are  currently ‘stuck in the middle’ to reconcile the  conflicting requirements of explorative and  exploitative practices and develop the poten-  tial synergy between these two practices. It is  also an option that offers opportunities to  create new knowledge and services.

BRINGING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE TO  INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES gsj_  7 54..66  JEFFREY J. REUER,1* ELKO KLIJN,2 FRANS A.J. VAN DEN BOSCH,3  and HENK W.

Some of these gaps might well be  appropriate given some of the unique features of IJVs, while others might require new consid-  eration and attention by organizations engaged in alliances. The expansive literatures on  corporate governance and IJVs have developed separately from one another, and there are  important opportunities to combine them. We argue that a need exists for a new generation of  IJV governance research that considers IJVs’ boards of directors as well as other dimensions  of governance. We highlight some research opportunities that are illustrative for the research  agenda that we are calling for that builds bridges between the literatures on corporate  governance and IJVs.

INTRODUCTION  The last two decades have seen many important  changes in corporate governance practices as well as  calls for reformby institutional investors, shareholder  activists, and governments. Corporate governance  clearly hasmany different facets, and our aim is not to  identify all the contours of these changes around the  world. However, one development in corporate gov-  ernance that is useful to note here is the prominent  movement to improve the credibility and accountabil-  ity of boards of directors (e.g., Denis andMcConnell,  2003; Monks and Minow, 2008), with a particular  emphasis given to increasing the independence of  boards and their committees. Moreover, associations  of CEOs (e.g., the Business Roundtable), lawyers  (e.g., the American Law Institute), and executive  search firms (e.g., Korn/Ferry International), among  others, have taken the broadly understood roles of  boards (e.g., monitoring and advice) and derived  more specific sets of director responsibilities in  attempts to develop and codify best practices.Mirror-  ing these developments for corporations and in the  public policy sphere is an extensive and expanding  literature inmanagement and finance on the structure,  functions, and performance implications of corporate  boards (see reviews by Dalton et al., 1998; Daily,  Dalton, and Cannella, 2003; Hillman and Dalziel,  2003; Hambrick, Werder, and Zajac, 2008).  It is striking to us that few, if any, of these devel-  opments have been extended or adapted to the  Keywords: international joint ventures; corporate governance;  boards of directors, alliance governance research; economic  organization  *Correspondence to: Jeffrey J.

However imperfect the governance practices  of corporations may be, initial indications suggest  that the gap with the governance practices of joint  ventures is large. As one example, McKinsey reports  that governance in joint ventures is often informal  and that standards vary widely. Based on their con-  sulting engagements as well as their interviews  carried out with more than 500 executives, Bamford  and Ernst (2005: 63) conclude that ‘corporate gov-  ernance has become a top priority for executives of  public companies. Yet too few of them have raised  the bar for governing joint ventures, whose financial-  management systems, most executives tell us, just  aren’t as good as those of wholly owned businesses.’  Bamford, Ernst, and Fubini (2004: 96) similarly  observe:  In the wake of Sarbanes-Oxley, companies have  increased their attention to transparency, risk man-  agement, disclosure, and performance management  in their wholly owned businesses. But our research  shows that companies don’t evaluate the perfor-  mance of their JVs as diligently as they do their  wholly owned businesses with equivalent assets.  That’s a mistake; parents need to treat their ventures  and their wholly owned units similarly. This means,  for large joint ventures, putting in place an audit  process like the ones used at the best public  companies.  Challenges exist for developing and putting to use  IJV performance metrics for many reasons, partly  because joint ventures are formed in uncertain  market contexts, for purposes other than increasing  accounting profits (e.g., learning, acquiring capabili-  ties, etc.), and for short time periods. In addition,  parent firms can hold divergent objectives—the joint  venture itself might do well but a parent firm does  not (or vice versa)—and transfer pricing and ancil-  lary agreements also complicate performance mea-  surement and monitoring (e.g., Anderson, 1990;  Ariño, 2003). These problems suggest that enhance-  ments to performance metrics and systems will  likely need to complement any other improvements  in joint venture governance in coming years.  Ernst and Bamford (2005) go on to call for estab-  lishing minimum governance guidelines for joint  ventures, in the same spirit of those used by the  California Public Employees’ Retirement System  (CalPERS) for corporations.As examples, they point  to having at least one outside director on the joint  venture board in order to inject discipline, and  having a nonexecutive chairman or lead director  serving as a counselor and performance coach to the  joint venture’s general manager. Therefore, their  findings and conclusions raise fundamental ques-  tions about whether governance practices in corpo-  rations can or should be extended to IJVs, what  domain translation issues need to be attended to  when adapting governance practices for the IJV  context, and how changes in governance should be  implemented in cross-border collaborations.  Similarly, a large gap exists between the expan-  sive literature on corporate governance and the  growing body of research on international joint ven-  tures. The IJV literature has long acknowledged the  importance of boards to the overall governance of  joint ventures, but little research has been devoted to  this topic (see e.g., Björkman, 1995; Kumar and  Seth, 1998 for exceptions). For example, early  research on IJVs has suggested in broad terms that  parent firms can control joint ventures through IJV  boards and by taking the lead in key staffing deci-  sions (e.g., Killing, 1983; Schaan, 1983; Harrigan,  1985; Glaister, Husan, and Buckley, 2004), but  research has not begun to tackle specific issues  related to the size, structure, dynamics, processes,  and implications of joint venture boards and  investigate these issues in systematic empirical  research as part of the IJV governance agenda in the  field.  Lacking rich data on alliances’ governance char-  acteristics, prior research has instead tended to resort  to very broad proxies for organizational form (e.g.,  non-equity versus equity alliance) or the division of  ownership in order to investigate governance. Such  indicators are only indirectly associated with IJV  governance mechanisms, and they are associated  with many other aspects of alliance design and man-  agement, including partners’ incentives, bargaining  power, decision rights, contracts, managerial com-  mitments, and so forth (e.g., Mjoen and Tallman  1997; Dhanaraj and Beamish, 2004; Choi and  Beamish, 2004; Barden, Steensma, and Lyles, 2005;  Zhang et al., 2007; Beamish and Lupton, 2009). We  believe that while the large literatures on corporate  governance and international joint ventures have  generally developed in isolation from one another,  considerable promise exists for cross-fertilization in  coming years. In this article, we wish to provide  some illustrations of how this cross-fertilization  might begin to occur.

In the sections that follow, we note some of  the most important theoretical stakes that exist in  organizational governance research on IJVs, and we  highlight some of the promising research directions  and questions that are available for scholarship on  alliance governance.  ALLIANCE GOVERNANCE  RESEARCH: THEORETICAL STAKES  AND OPPORTUNITIES  Some of the stakes and opportunities for IJV research  become clear when this body of work is placed in  historical perspective. Table 1 offers a brief summary  of the organizational economics research on alliance  governance. For brevity, we use the term ‘IJV’to refer  to a particular type of alliance, but we also wish to  note that important insights and contributions rel-  evant to IJVs have been made in studies that did not  distinguish international and domestic collabora-  tions, or only focused on the latter, and studies that  analyzed other types of collaborations also provide  insights applicable to equity joint ventures.  The IJV literature experienced important theoreti-  cal advances beginning in the late 1980s as scholars  started to shift attention from IJV trends, motives,  and the costs and benefits of IJVs that characterized  some of the earliest research on interfirm collabora-  tion in international business, management, and the  associated disciplines. This new research on alliance  investment decisions represented a first generation  of research on alliance governance and began to  tackle the more fundamental question of when joint  ventures are efficient relative to, or in comparison  with, other governance arrangements, such as acqui-  sitions, market transactions, or organic growth, all of  which can be the basis of international expansion or  confer other benefits such as access to complemen-  tary resources or growth opportunities (e.g.,  Gatignon and Anderson, 1988; Hennart, 1988; Wil-  liamson, 1991; Dunning, 1995; Teece, 1996; Villa-  longa and McGahan, 2005; Castañer, Garrette, and  Dussauge, 2009). In brief, IJV research was inter-  secting with work on the theory of the firm, and  alliances came to be viewed as hybrid organizational  forms along the market-hierarchies continuum to  explicate their unique governance properties.  Scholars routinely took an acquisition as a base-  line and identified certain conditions under which an  acquisition would be less efficient and, hence, a joint  venture would be preferable. Examples include situ-  ations in which cultural integration costs would be  significant, targeted assets inalienable, or sunk costs  and uncertainty large (e.g., Hennart, 1988; Kogut and  Singh, 1988; Kogut, 1991; Hennart and Reddy, 1997;  Table 1. Evolution of organizational economics research on alliance governance  Generation  of research  Theoretical focus Key question Core challenges  First The alliance  investment decision  When should a firm invest  in a joint venture (or  some other alliance)  compared to other  arrangements (e.g., M&A,  organic growth, exports,  etc.)?  Boards play an important role in organizational  economics theories of alliances (e.g., in  reducing information asymmetries or in  contending with hazards such as knowledge  misappropriation), but boards have not received  empirical attention in subsequent empirical  research using these theories.  Second The alliance type  decision  Conditional upon the  decision to partner, when  should a firm invest in an  equity versus non-equity  alliance?  • Research has relied on coarse proxies for  governance and control by boards (e.g., equity  versus non-equity, ownership level, etc.).  • Monitoring and incentives are tangled together  in these proxies.  Third The alliance design  decision  Conditional upon the choice  of alliance type, how  should the firm design the  alliance in detail (e.g.,  contract)?  • Boards are covered in alliance contracts and  provide a means of addressing incompleteness  in alliance contracts.  • Boards can shape the emergence of relational  norms and ex post opportunism.  56 J. J. Reuer et al.  Copyright © 2011 Strategic Management Society Global Strat. J., 1: 54–66 (2011)  DOI: 10.1111/j.2042-5805.2011.00007.x  Yin and Shanley, 2008). Thus, the economics-based  theory of alliances in large measure became a theory  of acquisition failure, much as the theory of the firm  was a theory of market failure (rather than vice  versa). This framing continues to this day in organi-  zational governance research on joint ventures. For  instance, scholars often use a representative acquisi-  tion (and joint venture) to draw out the governance  properties and efficiency implications of joint ven-  tures. Therefore, it has become important to examine  the heterogeneity among each of these organizational  forms to advance this comparative organizational  analysis and identify more sharply the boundary con-  ditions for each. In the case of joint ventures, this  means directly investigating their boards and other  facets of governance in order to understand these  hybrid governance arrangements more deeply and  then be in a position to compare different types of  joint ventures with different types of acquisitions that  differ in terms of managerial authority, incentive  structures, and decision rights.  Interestingly, as this literature began to develop,  boards actually played an important role in the theo-  ries of joint ventures. For instance, Balakrishnan and  Koza (1993) suggested that when a firm encounters  information asymmetries and the risk of adverse  selection, or overpayment, when contemplating an  acquisition, the firm can opt for a joint venture  instead to lessen these problems. Not only can a joint  venture involve less sunk investment, but firms can  use the joint venture to reduce information asymme-  tries over time before making a larger commitment  to a resource or market prospect in the future. In  particular, the incentives conferred by a joint  venture, such as the threat of termination and shared  ownership, can encourage knowledge sharing and  reduce asymmetric information. In addition, Bal-  akrishnan and Koza (1993) observed that the joint  venture’s board enables firms to monitor assets and  facilitate knowledge sharing through greater joint  control of the business. As a second illustration,  Pisano (1989) used arguments from transaction cost  theory and suggested that firms can exert their rights  via the board, thereby reducing ex post exchange  hazards such as knowledge misappropriation. These  illustrations indicate an important feature of alliance  research: the joint venture board figured importantly  into the economic theories of joint ventures and their  governance, even if IJV boards have not received  attention in subsequent empirical studies that have  relied on these same theories from organizational  economics.  Pisano’s (1989) work, and the second generation  of alliance governance research on firms’ alliance  type decisions, moved beyond the implicit assump-  tion or treatment of alliances as homogenous orga-  nizational forms by capturing essential features of  the numerous types of alliances that are available to  organizations. While no consensus existed, or now  exists, on a way to categorize diverse types of col-  laborative agreements, the most commonly used, as  well as parsimonious, taxonomy distinguishes non-  equity alliances on the one hand from equity alli-  ances on the other hand (Oxley, 1997; Contractor,  Woodley, and Piepenbrink, 2011). Compared to a  non-equity alliance, a joint venture is a type of equity  alliance involving shared ownership and a joint  board overseeing a separate business entity. Minority  equity partnerships are also equity alliances, but they  do not involve a separate business entity, so a parent  firm owns a fraction of another firm in its entirety  and may or may not have a seat on that parent firm’s  board (Robinson and Stuart, 2007).  While the joint board figures importantly in the  design of an IJV as well as the in theoretical litera-  ture on alliance types (Pisano, 1989), inferences are  ultimately difficult to draw regarding monitoring or  other functions these boards might serve because  joint ventures simultaneously have other features,  including incentive alignment through shared own-  ership and a separate business entity.When interpret-  ing results in this mature research stream, an  important point, therefore, needs to be emphasized:  the monitoring and incentive dimensions of control  are conflated when drawing comparisons across non-  equity alliances and joint ventures, so it is difficult  for alliance research to address two of the most  central features of joint ventures. Therefore, ques-  tions that arise include the following: (1) To what  extent are prior findings on the determinants of  equity versus non-equity alliances driven by moni-  toring and/or incentive considerations?; and (2)  When might firms use greater monitoring but less  incentive alignment or vice versa, and when are high  levels of monitoring and incentives required?  Getting into the details of alliance design is impor-  tant for advancing and testing theory on alliances, and  the third generation of research on alliance gover-  nance sought to do so by investigating the contractual  foundations of collaborative agreements (e.g.,  Parkhe, 1993; Luo, 2002; Carson, Madhok, and Wu,  2006; Vlaar, Van Den Bosch, and Volberda, 2006;  Reuer and Ariño, 2007; Ryall and Sampson, 2009).  Indeed, the heterogeneity of contractual provisions  Bringing Corporate Governance to International Joint Ventures 57  Copyright © 2011 Strategic Management Society Global Strat. J., 1: 54–66 (2011)  DOI: 10.1111/j.2042-5805.2011.00007.x  that firms might put into their alliances suggests that  it is plausible that parents might have substantial  safeguards and coordination mechanisms for some  non-equity alliances compared to IJVs, which  challenges the conventional simple ordering of non-  equity and equity alliances along the markets-  hierarchies continuum (Reuer andAriño, 2007). This  work also began to examine how formal and informal  governance arrangements relate to one another, par-  ticularly since trust is often seen as a key component  for the success of a collaborative agreement. While  formal governance mechanisms are generally  thought to drive out trust or substitute for relational  governance, it is possible for formal governance  mechanisms to promote expectations of cooperative  behavior by reducing near-term payoffs from oppor-  tunism and thereby promote the self-enforceability of  agreements (Poppo and Zenger, 2002). Prior relation-  ships can also help partners learn about each other,  new opportunities for exchange, and relevant contin-  gencies affecting their cooperative relationship, all of  which can lead to an elaboration of contractual detail  in the future (e.g.,Mayer andArgyres, 2004;Argyres,  Bercovitz, and Mayer 2007).  The work on the contractual foundations of alli-  ances in this third generation of research suggests at  least two potential research challenges for the future.  First, this work provides an analogy for any research  that would investigate alliance governance mecha-  nisms in detail: just as contracts provide a keyhole  through which alliance design issues can be investi-  gated, joint venture boards or other dimensions of  governance can offer a similar opportunity to under-  stand the details of alliance design. Second, it is  possible that the neglect of boards in IJV research  has impeded theory development and testing  because IJV boards are covered in alliance contracts,  they provide opportunities for private ordering under  contractual incompleteness, and they are structures  that can shape cooperative norms and processes  between firms as well as ex post opportunism. This  suggests that IJV boards potentially represent an  important omitted variable in studies on alliance  contracts and governance.  TOWARD A FOURTH GENERATION  OF ALLIANCE GOVERNANCE  RESARCH  A few studies examine how the corporate gover-  nance of parent firms affects their alliance invest-  ment behavior, such as the decision to engage in  alliances or the selection of alternative modes of  foreign market entry (e.g., Gulati and Westphal,  1999; Datta, Musteen, Herrmann, 2009; Musteen,  Datta, and Herrmann, 2009). These contributions  have taken valuable steps in bringing together the  expansive literatures on corporate governance and  strategic alliances. However, we believe there are  many additional opportunities for cross-fertilization  between these large literatures, and we would like  to encourage investigation of other potential points  of connection between them. For example, we  would like to suggest that there are attractive  research prospects for examining governance prac-  tices at the level of the international joint venture  itself (e.g., Björkman, 1995; Kumar and Seth,  1998), rather than at the level of the parent firm(s),  including IJVs’ boards of directors as well as other  internal governance mechanisms (such as compen-  sation and performance evaluation systems).  Table 2 summarizes important research domains on  the boards of IJVs and flags a few research ques-  tions that are part of the larger agenda we are  calling for in this article.  Boards of directors in IJVs  Functions of IJV boards  To begin with, there are many avenues for research  to study the functions of boards in the IJV context.  For instance, it would be interesting to consider how  particular roles of board members (e.g., monitoring,  advice, resource provision, strategy crafting, etc.)  vary across joint ventures, as well as draw compari-  sons of board members’ activities across IJVs,  unitary organizations, foreign subsidiaries, or other  organizational forms. For instance, in contrast to  companies having a diffuse set of equity investors,  the prototypical joint venture has two direct owners.  In principle, this concentrated ownership structure  addresses a free rider problem and encourages active  monitoring by the parent firms themselves rather  than the board, but owners’ collaborative motives  and their interests outside of the alliance agreement  can diverge greatly, making the board an important  governance body through which the parties can exert  their interests. Given the heterogeneity in IJV own-  ership structures, it would also be valuable in future  research to separate the effects caused by the distri-  bution of incentives and the effects due to monitor-  ing by the board as they are conflated in the broad  58 J. J. Reuer et al.  Copyright © 2011 Strategic Management Society Global Strat. J., 1: 54–66 (2011)  DOI: 10.1111/j.2042-5805.2011.00007.x  proxies for alliance governance used in many studies  (e.g., equity versus non-equity alliances, ownership  splits, etc.). Disentangling monitoring and incentives  is, therefore, critical in studying the control function  of IJV boards emphasized by agency theory. We  need to know the extent to which the board actively  monitors the IJV’s performance, is involved in suc-  cession planning and potentially firing managers,  and is involved in overseeing the legal compliance of  the joint venture.  Interesting differences are also evident across  IJV and corporate boards when directors’ roles are  seen from a resource dependence perspective. For  example, young and small organizations lacking  financial capital, legitimacy, or other resources are  apt to be dependent on external organizations and  can rely on outside directors for assistance in  obtaining such resources (e.g., Pfeffer and Salan-  cik, 1978; Mizruchi and Stearns, 1988). While  greenfield IJVs are also new organizations, they do  have access to financial capital, information, legiti-  macy, and other resources possessed by the parent  firms. In the case of acquisitive IJVs, the business  has already been situated within one of the parent  firm’s hierarchies prior to another organization  taking an equity stake in the business. It would,  therefore, be worthwhile to explore the extent to  which IJV board members provide advice or other  resources from the parent firms versus other orga-  nizations in the venture’s operating environment.  This also suggests that the composition of IJV  boards and the roles of directors will likely be dif-  ferent compared to other organizations and that the  functioning of boards might vary across greenfield  and acquisitive ventures.  Finally, the fact that international joint ventures  are foreign subsidiaries, or are hierarchically  related to the parent firms, also potentially changes  the functions fulfilled by IJV boards (e.g., Leksell  and Lindgren, 1982; Kriger, 1988; Zaheer and Her-  nandez, 2011). Board members’ roles are likely to  be shaped by the parent firms’ strategies as well as  their IJV capabilities and experience in the host  country. Kumar and Seth (1998) found that involve-  ment by boards in IJVs is a function of the strategic  interdependence between the IJV and its parent  firm, and Björkman’s (1995) study of 33 Sino-  Western IJVs found their boards to be active in  setting dividends, drawing up strategic plans, and  approving budgets. In addition, he reported that  foreign companies rely upon the relationships of  the chairman and other board members in solving  important issues and building new relationships in  China. Therefore, it would be interesting to inves-  tigate the mixture of directors’ roles (e.g., monitor-  ing, advice, resources, etc.), draw comparisons  across IJVs, and contrast them with other types of  foreign subsidiaries (e.g., greenfield wholly owned  subsidiaries as well as acquired companies or units  of firms).

Bringing Corporate Governance to International Joint Ventures 59  Copyright © 2011 Strategic Management Society Global Strat. J., 1: 54–66 (2011)  DOI: 10.1111/j.2042-5805.2011.00007.x  IJV board structures and processes  The literature on corporate board structures is enor-  mous and remains vibrant (e.g., Beekun, Stedham,  and Young, 1998; Lynall, Golden, and Hillman,  2003; Hambrick, Werder, and Zajac, 2008), and it  would be valuable to conduct parallel work on the  structure of IJV boards. Recent research in corporate  finance, for instance, has examined the theoretical  determinants of corporate board size (e.g., Boone  et al., 2007; Linck, Netter, and Yang, 2008), and  similar research could determine how the size or  composition of IJV boards reflects parent firms’  information needs, monitoring costs, or other theo-  retical considerations. It would also be valuable to  investigate other dimensions of board structure such  as duality, committees, or two-tier structures involv-  ing executive and nonexecutive directors (e.g.,  Baliga, Moyer, and Rao, 1996; Westphal, 1998;  Maassen and Van Den Bosch, 1999; Ellstrand,  Tihanyi, and Johnson, 2002; Adams, Hermalin, and  Weisbach, 2009). Many of the findings on board  size, demography, and so on are mixed in prior  research, so the IJV context might also provide a  fresh testing ground for these research questions in  the corporate governance literature at large.  As another example, there is a substantial litera-  ture on the antecedents and consequences of outside  directors serving on corporate boards (e.g., Westphal  and Zajac, 1997; Golden and Zajac, 2001; Anderson  and Reeb, 2004; Coles, Daniel, and Naveen, 2008),  and it would be interesting to examine director inde-  pendence for IJV boards. Bamford and Ernst (2005)  report that joint ventures rarely have outside direc-  tors on their boards and, indeed, they call for joint  ventures to have at least one outside director to ask  difficult questions and help partners reconcile their  different interests. Their observation also raises the  broader question of why current IJV governance  practices might be insufficient for some collabora-  tions or why the state of affairs for IJV governance is  so far out of equilibrium based on their recommen-  dations and the best practices for other organiza-  tions. In other words, what is keeping firms from  adopting certain governance practices for their IJV  boards, if these practices would enhance efficiency  (e.g., Nickerson and Silverman, 2003)? It would also  be useful to examine which specific managers from  the parent firms or affiliated companies serve on IJV  boards, what capabilities they possess, and how they  are involved on these boards. To have a richer under-  standing of these boards, such work might consider  directors’ appointment process, turnover rates, and  compensation. Carrying out related work on staffing  top management positions within joint ventures  would be valuable for similar reasons.  Several of the unique features of IJVs as hybrid  organizations could be connected with board char-  acteristics to advance the theory of alliances and  contribute to recent debates in this literature. Ques-  tions exist, for instance, as to whether and when  formal governance arrangements and relational  governance mechanisms operate as substitutes or  complements (e.g., Poppo and Zenger, 2002).  Debate also exists on the relative importance of  structural aspects of alliances versus collaborative  processes, as well as on the relationship between the  two (e.g., Bell, den Ouden, and Ziggers, 2006;  Hennart, 2006; Ariño and Ring, 2010). Given that  this work has often focused on governance elements  such as alliance type or contractual complexity, it  would be valuable to bring the IJV board into this  literature as an important omitted structural aspect of  collaborative agreements that is also potentially  bound up with certain collaborative processes.  Research questions that might be addressed in this  vein include the following: (1) How might monitor-  ing by the IJV board substitute for or complement  relational governance?; (2) To what extent do the  functions performed by IJV boards reflect contrac-  tual agreements versus ex post gaps in these agree-  ments due to contracting costs at the alliance design  stage?; (3) What are the conditions, if any, under  which significant monitoring by the IJV board  increases the odds of opportunism in a vicious cycle  rather than a virtual cycle (e.g., Ghoshal and Moran,  1996)?; and (4) To what extent can the involvement  of directors independently advance certain collabo-  rative outcomes (e.g., facilitating intended knowl-  edge transfers, curbing knowledge misappropriation,  mitigating other exchange hazards, enhancing coor-  dination) (e.g., Anand, forthcoming), or how much  can ex ante incentives (such as ownership sharing)  alone accomplish these or similar objectives?  Another key feature of hybrid governance struc-  tures such as IJVs is that they are transitional or  unstable forms of organization (e.g., Williamson,  1991; Reuer, 2001; Makino et al., 2007). This obser-  vation raises natural questions about how firms can  govern temporary organizational forms as well as  when parent firms make changes in their boards in  response to changes in alliances or their environ-  ments. It is understood that parent firms often rene-  gotiate alliance contracts and make changes in their  60 J. J. Reuer et al.  Copyright © 2011 Strategic Management Society Global Strat.

While corporations  also evolve in scale and diversity and other ways, it  would seem that the instability of many alliances is  of central importance in designing and executing  their governance.  Beyond boards in IJV governance  While we have emphasized the value of studying  boards of international joint ventures, clearly there  are many other facets of governing IJVs that are  worthy of research and would be valuable compo-  nents of a research agenda developing other points of  connection between the literatures on corporate gov-  ernance and international joint ventures. We would  like to highlight several of these other aspects of  governance in IJVs in order to illustrate some of the  research opportunities that exist at this interface. The  research questions appearing in Table 3 are intended  to be suggestive of the research futures that exist,  rather than to be exhaustive of research that might be  carried out on IJV governance. Moreover, given the  potential for different facets of corporate governance  to substitute for each other, equifinality is likely to  Table 3.

J., 1: 54–66 (2011)  DOI: 10.1111/j.2042-5805.2011.00007.x  exist in IJV governance practices such that the search  for one best model of IJV governance is likely to be  impossible, as in other areas of corporate governance  (Aguilera and Jackson, 2010).  A substantial literature exists on managerial  incentives in stand-alone organizations (Tosi et al.,  2000; Wade, O’Reilly, and Pollock, 2006; Wright  et al., 2007), yet very little is known about the incen-  tives of IJV board members, executives, and other  managers participating in collaborative agreements  (Kumar and Seth, 1998). It would be interesting to  determine how these agents’ particular incentives are  aligned with the interests of the international joint  venture as a distinct business entity and/or with the  interests of one or more of the parent firms. Owner-  ship or incentive compensation can help align inter-  ests as well as alter agents’ risk-taking behavior  (e.g., Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia, 1998; Sanders,  2001), so the question is how compensation pack-  ages might be tailored to the parents’ motives for  collaboration (Contractor and Lorange, 1988), such  as exploration versus exploitation (e.g., Koza and  Lewin, 1998), pursuing growth opportunities (e.g.,  Kogut, 1991), or enhancing firms’ competitive posi-  tions (Glaister and Buckley, 1996). It is worth point-  ing out that prior alliance research has emphasized  the structure of incentives in terms of parent firms’  ownership stakes rather than managerial ownership  and compensation of employees working for a joint  venture, so it would be valuable to investigate this  aspect of IJV governance in a more micro fashion.  This work could investigate the implications of  managerial ownership and compensation for IJV  outcomes such as trust and learning, and it could also  examine the extent to which any differences in part-  ners’ compensation policies are accommodated or  reconciled within the IJV.  We expect that improvements in IJV governance  could also depend on advances in performance  metrics and systems, a problem that has long been  challenging for IJV research as well as practice (e.g.,  Ariño, 2003). While the measurement of perfor-  mance in stand-alone organizations is arguably  clearer and has seen the development of shareholder-  friendly metrics such as economic value added (e.g.,  Young and O’Byrne, 2001), the measurement of IJV  performance is notoriously difficult given two or  more parents’ different interests, the amorphous  goals of some collaborative agreements, and the  attributional challenges that partners encounter in  complex deal structures or uncertain operating envi-  ronments (e.g.,Anderson, 1990). Therefore, research  might consider whether particular IJV performance  metrics or systems are more amenable to effective  IJV governance than others, or how governance  practices must be tailored to desired IJV outcomes. It  would also be worthwhile as a practical matter to  determine how parent firms, boards, committees, and  external auditors evaluate the performance of IJVs.  Finally, we believe it would be valuable for IJV  research to consider how joint venture governance  practices differ across nations based on countries’  unique institutional environments and the external  pressures on the governance of IJVs (e.g., Peng,  Wang, and Jiang, 2008). For instance, it would be  interesting to explore whether unique alliance gov-  ernance issues exist for certain economic actors like  state-owned enterprises, family firms, or nonprofits  in different countries. The potential efficiency of  certain IJV governance practices is also expected to  turn upon property rights regimes, regulations, and  market conditions that differ across countries (e.g.,  Shleifer and Vishny, 1997), so it would be valuable  to examine how the institutional context shapes gov-  ernance practices in international joint ventures.  A two-way bridge  While our focus has been on the ways in which the  international joint venture literature can potentially  be enriched by incorporating insights from the cor-  porate governance literature, it is also worth noting  the potential for corporate governance research to be  advanced by conducting work in the joint venture  context. Compared to unitary organizations studied  in corporate governance research, joint ventures  present many differences in degree (i.e., new ranges  for existing theoretical constructs) as well as differ-  ences in kind (i.e., altogether new variables to inves-  tigate). Therefore, it is possible that new theoretical  insights might be gained from studying joint venture  governance, new life might be given to debates on  the determinants or implications of particular aspects  of governance (e.g., board composition), inconclu-  sive results might be revisited (e.g., performance  implications of board structures), and new boundary  conditions could be identified for corporate gover-  nance theory (e.g., determinants of information  needs and monitoring costs).  The embeddedness of joint ventures within the  organizational hierarchies of two or more parent  firms suggests that, in ways, the governance of joint  ventures can be complex despite their small size. A  joint venture has dominant equity holders who have  62 J. J. Reuer et al.  Copyright © 2011 Strategic Management Society Global Strat. J., 1: 54–66 (2011)  DOI: 10.1111/j.2042-5805.2011.00007.x  an incentive to monitor the collaboration, but these  owners are also likely to have divergent interests.  The hierarchical relationship between the joint  venture and the parent firms and, ultimately, the  parents’ shareholders, suggests a complex nesting of  principal-agent relationships as well as potential  conflicts among principals and conflicts among  agents that might be studied. As a second example,  IJV research could contribute to corporate gover-  nance research on power and politics by examining  the behavioral structure of these boards and by iden-  tifying new dimensions of board heterogeneity  rather than treating it as a homogeneous unit (e.g.,  Hambrick et al., 2008). The location of joint ven-  tures lower in organizations also presents a poten-  tially interesting contrast with the upper echelon  perspective adopted in corporate governance studies.  Governance research in the joint venture domain  could also enhance the emerging streams of research  on internal board processes and their external  context. For instance, Hillman, Nicholson, and  Shropshire (2008) consider how directors’ identities  can influence their behaviors on boards. In the case  of joint ventures, the degree to which a director  identifies with a parent firm versus the joint venture  itself over time might be influenced by employment  relations, turnover, and a parent firm’s specific col-  laborative motives. Given that joint ventures are  often formed, adapted, and come to an end in a  compressed period of time, this unique research  setting could bring new insights on how organiza-  tional dynamics carry consequences for governance  processes. As a final example, the embeddedness of  joint ventures in different firms and nations indicates  that they can be a useful research domain to  better contextualize corporate governance research  (e.g., Pugliese et al., 2009; Aguilera and Jackson,  2010).  CONCLUDING REMARKS  Over the past two decades, the literature on strategic  alliances has benefited greatly from transaction cost  theory’s overarching principle that the ‘action  resides in the details’ (Williamson, 2002: 187) of  these hybrid organizational forms. What began as  research on firms’ selection of alliances versus other  organizational arrangements (e.g., acquisitions or  greenfield wholly owned subsidiaries) has pro-  gressed to analyses of different forms of alliances as  discrete governance structures (e.g., equity versus  non-equity collaborations) and to finer-grained  investigations of their contractual foundations.  While the joint venture board is commonly left in the  background in current theorizing about alliances and  has not been attended to in empirical studies using  organizational economics in the alliance domain, we  have shown that boards play an important role in  these theories as boards enable parties to address  exchange hazards, such as adverse selection, knowl-  edge misappropriation, and other moral hazards. In  addition, coarse proxies that are often used for alli-  ance governance are inadequate, as they confound  board monitoring with other considerations such as  incentives or coordination. Joint venture board vari-  ables also require attention in empirical research, as  they are related to other governance mechanisms  such as contractual safeguards and control rights.  Studying boards and other dimensions of alliance  governance in finer-grained terms as we have sug-  gested would, therefore, represent an important  fourth generation of research on alliance gover-  nance, and this literature could be enhanced by  drawing upon insights from corporate governance  research.

DE ECONOMIST 131, NR. 1, 1983   AN EXPLANATION OF  THE GROWTH OF SOCIAL  SECURITY    D ISABIL ITY  TRANSFERS   BY   FRANS A.J. VAN DEN BOSCH AND CAREL PETERSEN*   1 INTRODUCTION   In most European countries the continuing growth of  the costs o f  social   security constitutes a severe economic problem. Expressed as a percentage   of  the Gross Domestic Product social security transfer incomes have on   average increased from 18% in 1970 to 25% in 1979 in the E.E.C. countries)   Disability programmes are one of  the fastest-growing subsectors within the   social security sector, although the size per country differs remarkably. 2   In the literature a few attempts have been made to explain the growth of    disability programmes at a macro level (e.g. Van Praag and Halberstadt   (1980), Lando (1979) and Hambor (1975)). These studies show that the   growth of  the volume of  disability beneficiaries, and thus the costs of  dis-   ability programmes, can to a considerable degree be attributed to the worsened   economic situation in the 1970's. 3 However, at a meso level the growth of    the volume of  disability beneficiaries per branch o f  industry differs remark-   ably, at least in the Netherlands. Consequently, analysis o f  the determinants   * A draft of this paper was presented at the symposium 'Some Economic Aspects of   Disability,' Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands, October 1981.

PETERSEN   of growth in the volume of disability beneficiaries at a meso level, which is   the main aim of the present paper, constitutes a fruitful basis for a more   thorough analysis of the growth of social security disability transfers.   For this purpose we have made use of a conceptual framework. From this   framework we have deduced an empirically testable disability model. Section   2 presents a brief overview of the structure of Dutch disability programmes.   The conceptual framework is developed in section 3. The model to be tested   and the empirical evidence is presented in section 4. Finally, some con-   cluding remarks are presented in section 5.   2 A SHORT OUTLINE OF DUTCH DISABILITY PROGRAMMES   During the first year of disability to work due to illness or accident (including   occupational risks) an employee in the private sector of the Dutch economy   is entitled to a sickness benefit. If he is still disabled after one year, he is   awarded a benefit on the basis of the Disability Security Act. 4 In case of   prolonged disability an employee in the public sector is awarded a benefit   on the basis of the General Public Pensions Act.   The most relevant features of both disability programmes are (a) de-   pendent on the degree of disability, the benefit is a percentage of the last   earned wage up to a maximum of 80%; (b) the minimum required degree of   disability to be eligible for a benefit is only 15%; and (c) save recovery or   death, there is no maximum duration of the benefit up to the age of 65 s (for   more details see e.g. Commission of European Communities (1978)). The   only essential difference between the two programmes i  the period between   the first day of disability and the moment a disability benefit is awarded. In   the private sector this period is fixed at one year, whereas in the public   sector, depending on the prospects of the development of the disability, this   period is on average about 2 years.   4 Abbreviated: DSA. This act was introduced on July 1, 1967. As from that date   beneficiaries of displaced disability programmes receive a DSA award. We have dis-   regarded the General Disability Security Act, introduced in 1976, which is not essential   for our analysis.   5 The same legal structure is applicable to all branches of industry. This means that,   among others, the ratio of potential disability benefit o wage does not differ significant-   ly by branch of industry.   GROWTH OF SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY TRANSFERS 6 7   3 THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK   The growth of the real costs of disability transfers i  caused both by an in-   crease of the average real value of the disability benefits and the number of   disability beneficiaries. However, it appears that in the period being investi-   gated (1968-1979) the growth of the volume of beneficiaries amounts to   200% and thereby dominates the growth of the average real value of the dis-   ability benefits, which amounts to 45%. In this paper we will restrict our-   selves to an explanation of the growth of the number of disability bene-   ficiaries. Since the termination pattern of disability beneficiaries remains   fairly stable, the most important determinant of growth is the so-called dis-   ability incidence rate, i.e. the number of new disability awards in a certain   year per 100 insured persons. The disability incidence rate in the private   sector has increased from 1.2% in 1968 to 2.1% in 1979, resulting in an in-   crease in the total volume of disability beneficiaries from 160,000 in 1968   to 480,000 in 1979.   Table 1 shows that the development of the disability incidence rate per   branch of industry varies remarkably. It appears that the textile industry   shows the greatest absolute increase while banking, insurance and business   services show the lowest absolute increase of the disability incidence rate.   We will use a conceptual framework to investigate the determinants of  this diverging development. This framework forms an extension in relation   to the literature by also introducing the perceived state of health as an ex-   planatory variable. The hypothesis  that the disability incidence rate in both   the private and the public sector can be explained by the following variables   (see also Van den Bosch and Petersen (1979, 1983)) 6 :   DR = f(H, PH, L, O, E) (1)   where DR stands for the disability incidence rate, H for health, PH for per-   ceived state of health, L for legal structure, O for occupation and E for   economic factors.   A worsening state of health (H) will increase the chance of disability. In   addition to the more or less objective health indicator H, current values and   norms with respect o whether it is socially and personally acceptable to feel   oneself entitled to a benefit (PH) will play a role (see Lando (1974) and   Schechter (1981)). The legal structure (L), notably criteria governing eligibility   6 See for an analysis of disability by age Van den Bosch and Petersen (1982) and, in this   connection, for a vintage approach applied to labour Van den Bosch (1982).   68 F.A.J.

Source: Annual Reports of Industry Association, The Disabled Persons Fund, The Joint   Medical Service and the General Public Pension Statistics (1968-1979).   and benefit determination, may also contribute to the explanation of the dis-   ability incidence rate. As some occupations are of a more physically demand-   ing nature (e.g. the construction sector) or of a more mentally demanding   nature than others, it is obvious that account should be taken of the type of   occupation (O). Because, at least in principle, employers maximize profits,   it is rational to assume that economic factors (E) will also influence the dis-   GROWTH OF SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY TRANSFERS 69   ability incidence rate. For, given the rather rigid wage structure, employers   will be inclined to dismiss those employees first who are least productive,   e.g. due to handicaps, if the economic development is worsening (see Van   Praag and Emanuel (1983), Lando, (1974)).   Because a disability benefit is generally more attractive, both financially   and from the point of view of social acceptance, than unemployment benefits,   potentially unemployed persons will, if possible, prefer a disability to an un-   employment benefit in the Netherlands. The importance of the labour-   market situation in this country has recently been clearly stressed by the   OECD: 'Normally benefits are linked to the degree of disability as established   by the social security system and to the previous income. In the slack labour   market conditions of the last few years, however, it was felt that even minor   disablement was a major disadvantage to a job-seeker, so there has been a   general uprating of degrees of disability leading to more generous benefits.'   (OECD (1981), p. 35).   4 THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE   4.1 Explanatory Variables   In this section we will specify the hypothesized relationship and consequently   test the plausibility of the conceptual framework at a meso level, i.e. per   branch of industry for the period 1968-1979. Since we are interested in the   growth of the disability incidence rate per branch of industry, we must first   analyse the change of the explanatory variables.   We have, as is usual, employed the development of mortality as a proxy   for change in the state of health (see e.g. Doherty (1979)). Given the slightly   declining mortality rates of the Dutch population (standardized for age and   sex) in combination with the decreasing average age of the insured, it is   plausible to assume that state of health at least remains constant or may even   have improved slightly in the period under consideration. 7 The legal structure   has also remained essentially the same in this period. Furthermore, there is   no indication that the type of work per branch of industry was on the average   more demanding in 1979 than it was in 1968. This leaves two variables in ex-   planation of growth of the disability incidence rate, namely the perceived   7 For the sake of completeness it must be remarked that the development of the age   and sex structure per branch of industry has also been analysed. However, it appears   that during the period under consideration both the average age and the percentage of   women per branch of industry has remained fairly constant.   70 F.A.J. VAN DEN BOSCH AND C. PETERSEN   state of health and economic factors. As a proxy for economic development   per branch of industry we have used two alternative variables, namely the   share of  profits (or more precisely, nonlabour income) in value added by in-   dustry and the number of  employed.   The influence of the perceived state of health is approximated by the   development of the corrected isability incidence rate in the public sector of   the economy, for in the public sector profit maximizing behaviour of the em-   ployers is of  only minor importance. 8 It follows that according to the con-   ceptual framework the growth of the disability incidence rate in the public   sector is only determined by the altered perceived state of health. For in the   public sector as in the private sector the explanatory variables with respect   to state of health, legal structure, and occupational structure have not changed.   4.2 The Regression Model    From the above it follows that the disability model to be tested is   kd)Ri, t = a i + ~APH t + 3,iAEi, t_l + D; t = 1969 .... 1979 and i=   1,. .... 16. (2)   z~DRi, t being the change of  disability incidence rate per branch of industry   i in year t with regard to the disability incidence rate in that branch of in-   dustry in the base year 1968. PH t stands for the perceived state of health.   According to the last section the development of this explanatory variable is   approximated by the change in the disability incidence rate in the public   sector in year t in relation to the disability incidence rate in the public   sector in 1968. It has to be stressed that the branch of industry subscript i   is missing here, for it is plausible that the influence of a change of  PH on the   disability incidence rate does not differ per branch of industry.   The economic variable El, t_ 1 is operationalized by the change of the   index of  the share of profits in value added per branch of industry i in year   t-1 in relation to 1967. Alternatively the economic variable is operationalized   by the change of the index of the number of employed persons per branch   8 In order to make the disability incidence rates of the private and public sectors com-   parable we have made two corrections. Firstly, with respect to the difference inwaiting   period (see paragraph 2). Secondly, the average age in the public sector is approximately   5 years higher than in the private sector. By standardizing the disability incidence rate   of the public sector with the age distribution i  the private sector we have made com-   parison possible on this point, too. (For further details ee: Van den Bosch and Petersen   (1979)).   GROWTH OF SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY TRANSFERS 71   of industry i in year t-1 in relation to 1967. 9 In view of the one-year   waiting period before a disability benefit is awarded, a time lag of one year   has been applied. In addition, a dummy (D) is incorporated because of the   oil crisis in 1973 because, as a consequence of the oil crisis, economic growth   has structurally slowed down. This means that the expectations of both   employers (concerning e.g. costs and sales) and of employees (with respect   to employment prospects or opportunities) have become considerably less   favourable since 1973.   On the basis of the conceptual framework the hypothesis is, that the sign   of/3 will be positive, for a 'deterioration' of the perceived state of health will   increase the disability incidence rate. On the contrary 7 must be negative, for   better economic onditions will decrease the disability incidence rate. If our   assumption is correct, the coefficient with respect o the dummy must be   positive. Finally it must be remarked that in view of the short period under   observation the regression analysis employed is a combination of cross-   section and time-series analysis (for a similar approach see e.g. Barro et al.   (1979)). As it is quite likely that the influence of economic factors on the dis-   ability incidence rate varies per branch of industry, we have applied individual   intercepts (a/) and coefficients (7i) per branch of industry. 1° Besides, branches   of industry vary in size. The results presented below are thus in both weighted   and unweighted form. The weight per branch of industry in each year is the   square foot of the average number of employed persons in that year. H   4.3 Empirical Results   The basic empirical results are presented in tables 2a and 2b. The first four   columns of both tables relate to the unweighted regressions, the last four   columns deal with weighted regressions. As indicator of economic develop-   ment table 2a contains the employment variable EMil, t_1, whereas in table   2b the profit variable (SPli, t_l) is used as economic indicator.   Consider first the results presented in table 2a. Both the unweighted and   the weighted form show a good fit. It has to be remarked that the regression   result of the weighted form is slightly better. Further, in both forms all the   9 We have used an index number for the explanatory variables per branch of industry   since the absolute level of e.g. the profit share by branch of industry is not comparable.   For data and description see: Van den Bosch and Petersen (1981a).   10 The 0-hypothesis that the intercepts are equal has to be rejected on the basis of a   F-test on the 1% significance l vel.   11 Alternatively an average weight per branch of industry has been used. The results,   however, only slightly differ.   72 F.A.J.  VAN DEN BOSCH AND C.

This means that both a de-   terioration of the overall perception of health and a worsening of the econ-   omic situation will increase the number of disability awards. The only two   exceptions with respect o the economic variable are the metal products   branch (number 9) and retail trade and crafts (number 14). These branches   of industry have a rather low disability incidence rate in the base year 1968.   The trend dummy, which for the period 1968-1974 has the value zero and   after that the value 1, appears to be significant. We would moreover like to   draw attention to the fact that the coefficient of the perceived state of   health equals approximately one. According to the conceptual framework   it follows that a certain change in the disability incidence rate in the public   sector, caused by a change in perception of health, will be accompanied by   a change of the same magnitude in the disability incidence rate in the private   sector.   In general table 2b, where the share of profits is used as economic in-   dicator, shows the same results as table 2a. This means among other things   that the weighted form again shows a slightly better fit. In this table most   coefficients have the expected sign too.   The principal conclusion of the present analysis must be that the results of   the regression analysis are in general quite in accordance with our hypothesis,   namely that the growth in the disability incidence rate is partly a more or   less autonomous process which has taken place in all branches of industry.   This results from the evolution of norms and values with respects to the   perception of health. On the other hand it appears that the growth of the   disability incidence rate is dependent on economic development. Since   economic development varies considerably per branch of industry, it follows   that the growth of the disability incidence rate will show remarkable differ-   ences between the various branches of industry.   5 CONCLUSION   The overall conclusion of this paper is that the present analysis per branch of   industry confirms the considerable influence of economic factors on the   growth of disability transfers. In addition to this a change in a more elusive   variable, namely in perception of health, plays a role in the explanation of   the growth of the disability transfers, independent of the economic factors.   In view of the fact that the economic prospects of most European countries   are not very favourable, this means that the costs of social security will not   only rise, because of the growing number of unemployed, but also because   GROWTH OF SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY TRANSFERS 77   of the growth of the number of disability beneficiaries in the years to come.   The opposite side of the coin is that effective employment policies will also   result in less disability beneficiaries. In this context it would be interesting   to use the present analysis as a starting point for a cross-country study,   aimed at explaining the considerable divergence with respect to both dis-   ability incidence and disability costs per country J  2  APPENDIX    TABLE 1 - STANDARD DEVIATIONS OF THE EXPLANATORY VARIABLES   Branch  of  A pH t A SPIi, t-1 A EMli, t.1 Dummy   industry   (1) 0.195 0.227 0.061 0.522   (2) , ,, 0.270 0.055 ,,   (3) ,, 0.507 0.171 ,,   (4) ,, 0.292 0.219 ,,   (5) ,, 0.449 0.1-98 ,,   (6) ,, 0.059 0.081 ,,   (7) ,, 0.158 0.100 ,,   (8) ,, 0.258 0.078 ,,   (9) ,, 0.075 0.032 ,,   (10) ,, 0.180 0.044 ,,   (11) ,, 0.147 0.085 ,,   (12) ,, 0.086 0.072 ,,   (13) ,, 0.277 0.044 ,,   (14) ,, 0.182 0.043 ,,   (15)  ,, 0 .200  0 .055  ,,   (16) ,, 0.107 0.131 ,,   12 To give an impression of this divergence for five European countries, it appears that   the number of disability pensions in force as a percentage of the number of insured, in-   cluding disability beneficiaries, amounted in Belgium to 4.7%, in Western Germany to   8.8%, Finland 9.9%, France 2.4% and the Netherlands 10.8%, in 1977 (see Copeland   (1981)).   78 F.A.J.

GROWTH OF SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY TRANSFERS 79   Summary   AN EXPLANATION OF THE GROWTH OF SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY   TRANSFERS   The purpose of this paper is to provide an explanation for the growth of one   of the most important components of social security income transfers: dis-   ability benefits to people who withdraw from the labour market as a con-   sequence of becoming disabled. We use a disability model and apply this to   branches of industry for the Netherlands (1968-1979). The main conclusion   is that the growth of disability incidence rates can to a large degree be ex-   plained by worsening of the economic situation. In addition to this a change   in another variable, namely perception of health, plays a role in the ex-   planation of the growth fo disability transfers.   
Boards of Directors’ Contribution to Strategy:  A Literature Review and Research Agenda  Amedeo Pugliese*, Pieter-Jan Bezemer, Alessandro Zattoni,  Morten Huse, Frans A. J. Van den Bosch and Henk W. Volberda  ABSTRACT  Manuscript Type: Review  Research Question/Issue: Over the last four decades, research on the relationship between boards of directors and strategy  has proliferated. Yet to date there is little theoretical and empirical agreement regarding the question of how boards of  directors contribute to strategy. This review assesses the extant literature by highlighting emerging trends and identifying  several avenues for future research.  Research Findings/Results: Using a content-analysis of 150 articles published in 23 management journals up to 2007, we  describe and analyze how research on boards of directors and strategy has evolved over time. We illustrate how topics,  theories, settings, and sources of data interact and influence insights about board–strategy relationships during three  specific periods.  Theoretical Implications: Our study illustrates that research on boards of directors and strategy evolved from normative  and structural approaches to behavioral and cognitive approaches. Our results encourage future studies to examine the  impact of institutional and context-specific factors on the (expected) contribution of boards to strategy, and to apply  alternative methods to fully capture the impact of board processes and dynamics on strategy making.  Practical Implications: The increasing interest in boards of directors’ contribution to strategy echoes a movement towards  more strategic involvement of boards of directors. However, best governance practices and the emphasis on board inde-  pendence and control may hinder the board contribution to the strategic decision making. Our study invites investors and  policy-makers to consider the requirements for an effective strategic task when they nominate board members and develop  new regulations.  Keywords: Corporate Governance, Business Policy and Strategy, Board of Director Issues, Board Policy Issues,  Governance Theories  INTRODUCTION  O ver the last few decades, corporate governancesystems have undergone profound changes world-  wide. The globalization and liberalization of financial  markets, corporate governance scandals, and stronger  demands for accountability and transparency have placed  the duties and functioning of boards of directors at the  center of the corporate governance debate (Kiel and Nichol-  son, 2003; Ingley and Van Der Walt, 2005). The societal call  for an increasing involvement of the board of directors has  raised the question of what the appropriate role of boards  should be. While scholars and practitioners have generally  acknowledged the importance of adequate board control  and independence (Baysinger and Hoskisson, 1990; Jensen  and Zajac, 2004), boards’ involvement in their strategic role,  or the lack thereof, has been widely debated (Zahra and  Pearce, 1989; Golden and Zajac, 2001; Daily, Dalton and Can-  nella, 2003).  The discussion of boards’ strategic involvement has been  fueled by a combination of contextual factors, alternate theo-  retical perspectives, and inconclusive empirical results.  First, in the 1970s, it was observed that US boards of direc-  tors had been rather passive in the wake of corporate failures  and more strategic involvement was necessary to restore the  public confidence (Clendenin, 1972; Heller and Milton, 1972;  Mace, 1976; Machin and Wilson, 1979; Vance, 1979). More  recently, corporate governance reforms (Aguilera and  *Addresss for correspondence: University of Naples “Federico II”, Department of  Business Economics, Monte Sant’Angelo, 80122, Naples, Italy.

These developments have stimulated boards of directors to  challenge CEOs, and to become more involved in strategy,  an area that in the past was exclusively controlled by CEOs  (Ruigrok, Peck and Keller, 2006; Monks and Minow, 2008).  Second, the emergence of alternative, partially conflicting,  theoretical viewpoints has contributed to the debate. Theo-  ries, such as agency theory, resource dependency theory,  and stewardship theory, have ascribed different responsibili-  ties to boards with regard to strategy (Davis, 1991; Maassen  and Van Den Bosch, 1999). Third, while studies suggest that  board members are becoming more aware of their strategy  role (Demb and Neubauer, 1992; Heracleous, 2001; Huse,  2005), scholars have regularly highlighted the disagreement  in the empirical research on the relationship between boards  and strategy (Johnson, Daily and Ellstrand, 1996; Deutsch,  2005).  The above theoretical pluralism and empirical inconclu-  siveness in the literature on boards of directors and strategy  raise the following questions: What is the stance of research  in this area? How has the field been evolving over time?And  what are the main challenges and future opportunities? In  this paper, we analyze 150 articles on boards and strategy  published in 23 management journals until 2007, in order to  provide answers to these questions. Thereby, this paper con-  tributes to the literature on boards and strategy in three  ways. First, it describes how studies on boards and strategy  have been evolving and illustrates how certain topics, theo-  ries, settings, and sources of data interact and have influ-  enced our knowledge about board–strategy relationships  during certain periods. For instance, our data reveal that  during the 1990s the field was dominated by empirical  studies in a US setting that mainly refer to agency theory and  focus on the determinants and consequences of boards’ stra-  tegic involvement. Second, the paper complements previous  literature reviews that have partially covered this domain  (Zahra and Pearce, 1989; Johnson et al., 1996; Deutsch, 2005).  Given the time elapsed since these reviews, the intensifica-  tion of the corporate governance debate internationally and  the large number of studies conducted on boards of direc-  tors and strategy more recently, it is the right time for due  reflection on achievements in this area (Huse, 2005). Third,  the paper highlights several avenues to advance the field of  study. Our findings encourage governance scholars to  further investigate the impact of contextual forces at mul-  tiple levels, to further comprehend board processes and  dynamics, and to adopt methods aimed at opening the black  box of board research. Finally, the article has implications for  practice. Existing board practices emphasize, in fact, board  control and independence as antecedents of good gover-  nance, but these aspects may also hinder the board’s contri-  bution to strategy making. In line with some recent works,  our study suggests that the requirements for an effective  strategic task should be taken into account while forming  boards and devising new regulations.  The paper is structured as follows. Section One describes  the basics of the board–strategy debate and the theoretical  pluralism and empirical inconclusiveness emerging from  the literature on boards and strategy. Section Two describes  the research methodology, i.e., how we selected journals and  determined our sample of 150 articles to be included in our  review, how we coded the content of each article, and how  data were analyzed statistically. Next, in Section Three, we  present the results of our review and describe how the field  has evolved and illustrate how certain topics, theories, set-  tings, and sources of data interact and have dominated in  certain time periods. In our final section, we discuss the  implications for both theory and practice and present a  research agenda for future studies on boards and strategy.  THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL DEBATE  ON BOARDS AND STRATEGY  The appropriate role of the board of directors in formulating  and implementing strategy has been long debated (Andrews  1981a; 1981b; Judge and Zeithaml, 1992; McNulty and Pet-  tigrew, 1999; Useem, 2003). While the literature has acknowl-  edged the importance and need for adequate board control  and independence (Baysinger and Hoskisson, 1990; Jensen  and Zajac, 2004), both the contributions of boards to strategy  and the desirability of such practice have remained topics  of discussion (Golden and Zajac, 2001; Daily et al., 2003). In  light of a multitude of theoretical lenses and empirical find-  ings in the management literature, Zahra and Pearce’s obser-  vation that “there is controversy over the nature of directors’  strategic role” (1989: 328) still seems to be topical after 20  years of research.  The debate on boards’ strategic contributions dates as far  back as the 1970s. During this decade, several US scholars  and practitioners observed that boards were rather passive  in the wake of US corporate failures and that more strategic  involvement was necessary to restore public confidence  (Clendenin, 1972; Mace, 1976; Vance, 1979). A growing theo-  retical debate was boosted by Fama and Jensen’s seminal  work (1983) in which they distinguished between decision  management (i.e., initiating and implementing strategic  decisions) and decision control (i.e., ratifying and monitor-  ing strategic actions). The two tasks were ascribed to the top  management team and the board of directors respectively.  Their rationale has influenced the debate ever since. By  relying on a clear distinction of responsibilities between  boards and management, scholars have viewed the potential  contributions of boards to strategy as fairly limited because  of their distance from day-to-day operations, the presence of  information asymmetries, and the need to remain indepen-  dent (Charan, 1998; Conger, Lawler and Finegold, 2001;  Hendry and Kiel, 2004). Instead, others have argued that  boards of directors are legally responsible for the strategy of  firms (Harrison, 1987; Coffee, 2005; Yawson, 2006) and that  boards are in an excellent position to contribute to strategy  (Andrews, 1980; Tricker, 1984; Goodstein, Gautam, and  Boeker, 1994; Carpenter and Westphal, 2001).  Theoretical Pluralism in the Board–Strategy Debate  From a theoretical standpoint, the debate around board’s  strategic involvement has been fueled by conflict and con-  BOARDS OF DIRECTORS’ CONTRIBUTION TO STRATEGY 293  Volume 17 Number 3 May 2009© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  sensus theories (Davis, 1991; Muth and Donaldson, 1998;  Maassen and Van Den Bosch, 1999). A conflict perspective  conceptualizes managers as self-interested agents that  should be closely monitored (Jensen and Meckling, 1976;  Eisenhardt, 1989). For instance, agency theory posits that  boards affect strategic choices by preventing managers from  acting opportunistically at the expense of shareholders  (Mizruchi, 1983). In this view, boards are not expected to  initiate and implement strategies, but they contribute  through ratifying and monitoring strategic decisions (Fama  and Jensen, 1983; Goodstein et al., 1994). Board involvement  in strategy appears to conflict with this view, as it would  make boards of directors co-responsible for strategic deci-  sions and it would jeopardize the required distance between  board members and managers (Boyd, 1990; 1994; Huse, 1994;  Sundaramurthy and Lewis, 2003).  A consensus perspective conceptualizes managers as  intrinsically motivated agents acting in the best interest of  the firm (Davis, Schoorman and Donaldson, 1997). Accord-  ingly, through various theoretical lenses boards are defined  as organizational bodies that may support empowered man-  agers in strategy formulation and implementation (Bezemer,  Maassen, Van den Bosch and Volberda, 2007; Huse, 2007).  For example, resource dependency theory suggests that  board members are in an excellent position to contribute to  strategic decision making by providing access to resources  upon which firms depend (Pfeffer, 1972; 1973; Pfeffer and  Salancik, 1978; Hillman and Dalziel, 2003). The stewardship  theory challenges the rationale of agency theory by arguing  that the interests of managers and board members do not  necessarily collide (Davis et al., 1997; Muth and Donaldson,  1998). In this perspective, the role of boards is to facilitate  and empower managers, also in the realm of strategy. More  lately, cognitive and behavioral approaches have empha-  sized the importance of understanding cognitive contribu-  tions of board members as well as the impact of boardroom  dynamics on strategic decision making (Pettigrew, 1992;  McNulty and Pettigrew, 1999; Rindova, 1999; Pye and  Camm, 2003).  Empirical Inconclusiveness in the Board–Strategy  Debate  Aside of the theoretical debate, empirical findings provide  mixed results as well. In recent decades, scholars have regu-  larly emphasized the presence of a wealth of inconclusive  empirical findings (Deutsch, 2005). On the one hand, studies  have shown that boards have been rather passive and subject  to CEOs and executives’ dominance (Mace, 1971; Herman,  1981; Kosnik, 1987; Lorsch and McIver, 1989). Furthermore,  anecdotal evidence suggests that boards might destroy value  when they become involved in strategy (cf. Jensen, 1993; Hitt,  Harrison, and Ireland, 2001; Fulghieri andHodrick, 2006).On  the other hand, scholars have shown that boards are becom-  ing more actively involved in strategy (Zahra, 1990; Zahra  and Filatotchev, 2004; Ingley and Van Der Walt, 2005; Ravasi  and Zattoni, 2006; Schmidt and Bauer, 2006). Moreover,  boardshave affected important elements of strategies, such as  the scope of the firm (Tihanyi, Johnson, Hoskisson and Hitt,  2003; Jensen and Zajac, 2004), entrepreneurship and innova-  tion (Fried, Burton and Hisrich, 1998; Zahra, Neubaum and  Huse, 2000; Hoskisson et al., 2002), strategic change (Johnson,  Hoskisson and Hitt, 1993; Westphal and Fredrickson, 2001;  Filatotchev and Toms, 2003), R&D strategies (Baysinger,  Kosnik and Turk, 1991; Kor, 2006), and internationalization  (Sanders andCarpenter, 1998;Datta, Rajagopalan andZhang,  2003).  In sum, the literature on boards of directors and strategy  may be characterized by theoretical pluralism and by empiri-  cal inconclusiveness, both originating from scholarly contri-  butions and anecdotal evidence. In the remainder of this  paper, we seek to highlight how distinct patterns of research  have emerged over the years and their key attributes.  METHOD  Selection of Journals and Papers  To examine the evolving literature on boards and strategy,  we decided to focus on peer-reviewed studies published in  management journals, regardless of their impact factor  (Seglen, 1994). We selected all journals included in the man-  agement category within the ISI-Web of Knowledge during  2007. Our search produced 81 records in total. In the next  phase, we used the databases ABI/Inform, Business Source  Premier, Ebsco-Host, JSTOR, and Swetsnet to search for all  paper publications containing simultaneously the terms  “board” and “strateg*” or “director” and “strateg*” in the  title, abstract, and/or keywords. This approach enabled us to  identify a set of articles directly referring to the debate on  boards’ and directors’ contributions to strategy. This proce-  dure resulted in 371 hits in total; 150 papers (40.40 per cent)  turned out to be relevant to our examination. The large dif-  ference between the number of hits and the number of  included papers is due to several factors. We excluded  papers referring to board games, papers using the term  across-the-board, fictive Harvard cases, letters from editors,  book reviews, papers referring to organizations with the  term “board” in their name, and papers referring to other  management layers than the board of directors. In sum, our  final sample consists of 150 articles published in 23 journals  from 1972 (first included paper) to 2007.  Content Analysis  In order to analyze the evolving nature of studies on boards of  directors and strategy, two raters independently analyzed  and coded the set of 150 articles (Coffey and Atkinson, 1996;  Krippendorff, 2005). The two raters were asked to codify all  basic elements of a paper: (1) type of article; (2) main research  topic; (3) use of theories; (4) research setting; (5) source of  data; and (6) the definition of board’s strategic involvement  (Insch, Moore and Murphy, 1997). The coding scheme was  pre-tested on two sub-samples of 30 articles after which the  raters came to an agreement about the final set of items to be  used in the classification for each category.A review was then  conducted on the whole set of articles (D’Aveni and Mac-  Millan, 1994).At the endof the codingprocedure, the two sets  of data were matched. There appeared to be a high degree of  overlap in the responses – only 54 out of 828 itemswere coded  differently by the two raters. Inter-rater reliability scores  294 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  Volume 17 Number 3 May 2009 © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  were calculated, and the percent age of agreement (93.50 per  cent) and Cohen’s Kappa (.92) were both above the accep-  tance threshold (Cohen, 1960; Dewey, 1983). A final meeting  was arranged to discuss the 54 inconsistencies in the  responses. To reconcile the disagreements, the articles were  re-read and recoded. If the raters still did not agree on the  coding, a senior strategy professor – who was involved in the  research project – was asked to provide a clarifying interpre-  tation (Lee, 1999). In the following sections we discuss all  categories in more detail.  Type of Article. The 150 articles were differentiated accord-  ing to their nature – “conceptual” versus “empirical.” Papers  were coded as “conceptual” when they sought to advance or  refine theory and were solely based on deductive reasoning  without any empirical metrics. Papers were labeled “empiri-  cal” if authors applied inductive logics, described their  methods in a separate section, and argued on the strength of  data obtained from qualitative research methods (i.e., inter-  views, participant observation, and anecdotes) and/or quan-  titative methods (i.e., archival data and surveys).  Main Research Topic. Building upon prior studies (e.g.,  Zahra and Pearce, 1989; Pearce and Zahra, 1992; Stiles, 2001;  Huse, 2005), we distinguished four groups of papers in rela-  tion to the main research topic. The first group examines the  determinants of board’s strategic involvement. Among  others, scholars have sought to relate environmental charac-  teristics, ownership structure, board composition, and  incentive mechanisms to various levels of board’s strategic  involvement. The second group of studies investigates the  consequences of board’s strategic involvement. For instance,  scholars have addressed the impact of specific board charac-  teristics on strategic outcomes, such as diversification, inter-  nationalization, innovation, and strategic change. The third  group of papers explores boards’ participation in strategic  decision-making processes, i.e., the ways in which boards  contribute internally to decision-making processes by inter-  acting with TMTs in various phases. Finally, the fourth  group of papers discusses from a normative stance why  board’s strategic involvement may or may not be desirable.  Topics of debate include the reasons for the perceived pas-  sivity of boards of directors in this respect and the question  of how far board involvement into strategy should be going.  Use of Theories. To examine the theoretical development of  the field, we mapped the theories to which each paper  explicitly referred. Given the widespread application of  agency theory in the literature on boards and strategy, we  decided to create a variable capturing whether a paper  referred to: (1) agency theory solely; (2) multiple theories,  including agency theory; and (3) other theories than agency  theory or no theory.  Research Setting. As highlighted by comparative corporate  governance studies highlight, institutional contexts widely  vary between nations and have a profound impact on local  corporate governance structures and practices (Aguilera and  Cuervo-Cazurra, 2004; Aguilera, Filatotchev, Gospel and  Jackson, 2008; Zattoni and Cuomo, 2008). Therefore, an  important dimension to our analysis is added by examining  the empirical setting in which research on boards and strat-  egy has been conducted. As most empirical articles in our  sample are based on US data, we decided to use the follow-  ing categorizations: (1) articles using exclusively data drawn  from the US; (2) articles using data from multiple countries,  including the US; and (3) articles using data drawn from a  non-US context.  Source of Data. To provide insights in the use of different  data sources, we coded the empirical articles with the fol-  lowing six categories: (1) interviews; (2) anecdotal evidence;  (3) archival data; (4) survey data; (5) direct observations; and  (6) combinations of the above-mentioned sources. In the  latter category, we only included articles using combinations  of interviews and survey data, interviews and archival data,  and survey data and archival data.  Definition of Board’s Strategic Involvement. Board’s stra-  tegic involvement is a latent construct and no single way to  define or interpret it emerges from the literature (Ravasi and  Zattoni, 2006). Building upon prior studies (Zahra and  Pearce, 1990; 1992; Judge and Zeithaml, 1992; McNulty and  Pettigrew, 1999), we distinguished four broad categories to  classify the definition of board’s strategic involvement. The  first category includes studies assessing how boards of  directors impact on the general strategy of companies, e.g.,  by developing the mission, establishing long-term targets,  and allocating resources (Zahra and Pearce, 1990; Volberda,  Baden-Fuller and Van den Bosch, 2001). The second group of  papers investigates how boards contribute to specific strate-  gic outcomes. The majority of the papers in this category are  input–output studies that aim to identify how board com-  position affects strategic outcomes, such as innovation,  change, diversification, and mergers and acquisitions  (Johnson et al., 1996). The third group encompasses research  that explores how boards participate in various phases of  strategic decision making through interacting with TMTs.  Among others, the studies conducted by Judge and Dobbins  (1995), Forbes and Milliken (1999), and Rindova (1999) are  included in this category. Finally, the fourth category con-  sists of papers in which the nature of board’s strategic  involvement is not clearly stated and defined. Most papers  published in the 1970s and 1980s fit into this category, as the  concept of board’s strategic involvement was in general mar-  ginally defined in the early years.  EMPIRICAL RESULTS  Growing Attention to Research on Boards and  Strategy  In recent decades, scholars and practitioners have debated  the relationship between the boards of directors and strat-  egy. Figure 1 illustrates the historical development of the  number of published articles explicitly referring to boards  and strategy in the management literature. As depicted, the  first paper was published in 1972, and in the following  decades the number of published articles steadily increased.  BOARDS OF DIRECTORS’ CONTRIBUTION TO STRATEGY 295  Volume 17 Number 3 May 2009© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  Studies on boards and strategy were published irregularly  during the early years prior to the publication of Zahra and  Pearce’s study in 1989. Since then, the marked increase in the  average number of articles on the topic has reflected the  growing attention of scholars in the field of strategy and  governance (from 1.30 in the period 1972–1989 to 9.60 in the  period 2001–2007). Also in relative terms the space devoted  to studies on boards of directors and strategy has increased  – from .10 articles per management journal per year in the  period 1972–1989 to .40 articles in the period 2001–2007.  Finally, it is noteworthy that in the period 1972–1989 most  papers were published in general, applied practice-oriented  journals, such as the Long Range Planning (8), California Man-  agement Review (6), and Harvard Business Review (5). Since  1990 two specialized journals in strategy and corporate gov-  ernance, Corporate Governance: An International Review (24)  and Strategic Management Journal (14), have contributed the  most (see Figure 2).  Descriptives and Interactions of Topics, Theories,  Settings, and Data Sources  Figure 3 provides an overview of the characteristics of the  articles that have contributed to the growing attention in  boards of directors and strategy. The papers are overwhelm-  ingly empirical (N = 114; 76 per cent). Most empirical  studies have been conducted in the US (N = 72; 62 per cent)  or in multiple settings including the US (N = 5; 4 per cent).  With regard to the main research topic, most articles have  contributed to the debate on the desirability of board’s stra-  tegic involvement (N = 41; 27 per cent), although the overall  sample is distributed evenly across all categories. In terms of  use of theories, agency theory is the prevailing lens (N = 63;  42 per cent). It has been used as the sole theoretical lens  (N = 27; 18 per cent) and in combination with other theoreti-  cal lenses (N = 36; 24 per cent). The sources of data are quite  diverse, although the use of archival data (N = 45; 40 per  cent) and of multiple sources (N = 22; 19 per cent) is most  common. Finally, the largest group of studies defines board’s  strategic involvement in terms of boards’ contributions to  specific strategic outcomes (N = 52; 35 per cent), while the  smallest group defines it as boards’ participation to strategic  decision making (N = 22; 15 per cent).  FIGURE 1  Historical Development Research on Boards and Strategy  FIGURE 2  Overview of Journals with Included Publications Per Time Period  296 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  Volume 17 Number 3 May 2009 © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  Furthermore, Figure 3 illustrates how topics, theories, set-  tings, and data sources interact. Most notable are the key  differences between empirical studies that have been con-  ducted in a US context and those conducted in a non-US  context. In the US context scholars have published most on  the determinants (N = 26; 36 per cent) and consequences of  board’s strategic involvement (N = 21; 29 per cent). Further-  more, these studies refer to agency theory in most instances  (N = 38; 53 per cent) and mainly use archival data (N = 39; 54  per cent). Finally, board’s strategic involvement has gener-  ally been defined as the contribution of boards to specific  strategic outcomes, such as innovation, strategic change, and  mergers and acquisitions (N = 37; 51 per cent). In contrast,  studies conducted in a non-US context most often examine  the participation in strategic decision making by boards  (N = 14; 38 per cent). Furthermore, these studies often refer  to alternative theoretical lenses (N = 25; 68 per cent) and use  qualitative methods, such as interviews (N = 10; 27 per cent)  and direct observations (N = 5; 14 per cent), more often.  Finally, these studies differ in their definition of board’s stra-  tegic involvement, i.e., all categories are evenly represented.  Theoretical papers differ from both types of empirical  papers. These papers generally address the practice and  question the desirability of boards’ strategic involvement  (N = 19; 53 per cent), showing a limited reference to agency  theory (N = 13; 36 per cent); and the definition of board’s  strategic involvement is in most instances rather than  unspecified (N = 17; 47 per cent). We tested the above-  mentioned interactions for statistical significance. Several  cross tabulations reveal that the relationships between the  main research topic, use of theories, research setting, and the  definition of board’s strategic involvement are indeed statis-  tically significant at the .05 level.  Three Distinct Research Periods  In order to observe an evolutionary pattern in previous  research, we identified three periods and assigned each  article to one of them according to the year of publication.  Even though the three windows are not homogeneous in  terms of time-length, we clustered them in accordance with  two criteria. First, we observed changes in the slope of the  curve with a cumulative number of articles published over  time (see Figure 1). We considered a cut-off for a new period  if (1) there was a sharp increase in the number of publica-  tions in a given year; and (2) this number was significantly  higher than the average during the previous years. Second,  we identified a new period if relevant and highly influential  articles (or groups of articles) came out during a given year  or the year before. Major changes in a field of study often  occur thanks to breakthroughs and innovative articles that  suggest new theoretical approaches and/or methods and set  FIGURE 3  Descriptives and Interactions of Topics, Theories, Settings, and Data Sources**  BOARDS OF DIRECTORS’ CONTRIBUTION TO STRATEGY 297  Volume 17 Number 3 May 2009© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  a new agenda for future research (Kuhn, 1962). We checked  for robustness by examining whether our findings would  change if we slightly changed our cut-off points. Although  our results became less significant, overall the witnessed  developments proved to be robust.  Our first observation window covers the period from the  first publication (1972) until Zahra and Pearce’s literature  review in 1989. In this period, the interest in studies on  boards and strategy seems to be infrequent and concentrated  around the years 1972, 1979, and 1986. In 1990, one year after  Zahra and Pearce’s literature review, six papers on the topic  were published, i.e., Baysinger and Hoskisson (1990), Boyd  (1990), Hoskisson and Turk (1990), Kosnik (1990), Lang and  Lockhart (1990), and Zahra (1990). These papers provided  input to a new strand of research, and most of the literature  in the following years sought to analyze the relationship  between board composition and strategic outcomes. Our  second observation window ends in 2000. In 1999 and 2000,  great interest around boards and strategy arose, as 17 articles  were published in the two years. During this period, an  alternate line of literature came out with a new perspective  on boards’ roles and behavior (Dalton, Daily, Ellstrand and  Johnson, 1998; Forbes and Milliken, 1999; Gulati and West-  phal, 1999; McNulty and Pettigrew, 1999; Rindova, 1999;  Hillman, Cannella and Paetzold, 2000). These researchers  had a significant impact on the field and fueled the debate  around cognitive and behavioral approaches. In the follow-  ing sections, we will discuss the distinctive characteristics  FIGURE 4  Evolution of the Literature on Boards and Strategy  298 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  Volume 17 Number 3 May 2009 © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  of articles published during each period (see Figures 4  and 5).  Period 1 (1972–1989): The Emerging Debate About  Boards’ Strategic Involvement. The early literature explic-  itly referring to boards and strategy dates back to the begin-  ning of the 1970s. At that time, the debate was mostly driven  by the practical needs that the US business community was  facing. Corporate failures and governance scandals together  with the increasing requirements for higher accountability  fueled studies on boards and governance issues (Vance,  1979; Lorsch, 1986). At the same time, strategy started to  become established as a research field (Volberda and Elfring,  2001), fueled by major changes in the business environment  of most Western countries (i.e., the increase in Japanese com-  petition and the oil crisis) (Pettigrew, Thomas and Whitting-  ton, 2002). During this first period, research on boards and  strategy was characterized by a debate on the desirability of  active board involvement, also in the realm of strategy. This  discussion followed an ongoing US debate around a per-  ceived passivity of boards of directors at that time (Mace,  1971; Herman, 1981; Stiles and Taylor, 2002). The ongoing  debate has been hosted mainly by three general, applied  practice-oriented journals (i.e., Long Range Planning, Califor-  nia Management Review, and Harvard Business Review) that  covered almost 80 per cent of the studies in this period (see  Figure 2). Regardless of the type of articles, both conceptual  and empirical articles have generally sought to initiate a  discussion around the desirability of boards’ involvement in  strategy (67 per cent).  Overall, two lines of research with opposite views on the  topic can be distinguished during this period. On the one  hand, boards were considered one of the main actors in  strategic decision-making processes, although they are not  expected to formulate strategy. For instance, Andrews (1980;  1981a) emphasized that boards are in a perfect position to  search for alternative corporate strategies. Furthermore,  Felton (1979) argued that boards should confront manage-  ment in cases where results deviate from expectations, also  in the realm of strategy. To support adequate fulfillment of  the strategy role, Wommack (1979) and Harrison (1987)  suggest that boards should create an internal board commit-  tee dedicated to this issue. On the other hand, another group  of scholars strongly argued that boards should not be  actively involved in strategy. For instance, according to  Heller and Milton (1972), strategic issues are a difficult  subject for directors to get into, as they are often not  FIGURE 5  The Evolution of Research on Board’s Strategic Involvement*  BOARDS OF DIRECTORS’ CONTRIBUTION TO STRATEGY 299  Volume 17 Number 3 May 2009© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  involved in the company on a daily basis. Moreover, Mace  (1976) argues that outside directors are mostly hired through  cooptation or hold board positions elsewhere; this practice  may limit their commitment and involvement in strategic  issues. Finally, Rosenstein (1987) describes several hurdles  that directors may face when they try to get involved in  strategy.  In sum, the key characteristics of research during this  period are: (1) the lack of one prevailing theory; (2) the  predominance of articles discussing the desirability of  board’s strategic involvement (67 per cent); and (3) a broadly  defined concept of board’s strategic involvement in most  instances (79 per cent). Therefore, it comes as no surprise  that Zahra and Pearce (1989: 304), at the end of this period,  assert that “overall, empirical research on the boards’ stra-  tegic role is in its infancy stage.”  Period 2 (1990–2000): The Heyday of “Input-Output”  Approaches. Two breakthrough articles influenced the  emerging literature on boards of directors and strategy at the  beginning of the 1990s. Zahra and Pearce’s (1989) literature  review highlighted the importance of understanding the  relationship between board characteristics and structure,  and strategy. Additionally, Baysinger and Hoskisson (1990:  73) discussed the prominence of board-TMT dynamics and  its implications for strategy. Furthermore, they emphasized  also that “evaluating the strategic implications of boards of  directors requires empirical analysis.” Following these sug-  gestions, multiple studies were published during the next  decade. Generally, they relate board characteristics and  structure (i.e., board size, CEO-duality, board diversity, out-  sider ratio, tenure, and directors’ equity stakes) to strategic  outcomes, such as acquisitions (Haunschild, 1993; Hayward  and Hambrick, 1997; Haunschild and Beckman, 1998), stra-  tegic change (Goodstein and Boeker, 1992; Goodstein et al.,  1994; Bergh, 1995), corporate restructuring (Sheppard, 1994;  Daily, 1995), entrepreneurship (Zahra, 1996), international-  ization (Sanders and Carpenter, 1998), and R&D expendi-  tures (Baysinger et al., 1991). Generally, these studies provide  mixed evidence of relationships between board characteris-  tics and strategy (Daily et al., 2003; Deutsch, 2005).  Illustrative of this line of inquiry is that the majority of the  studies (1) refer to agency theory (54 per cent); (2) use US  samples (86 per cent); (3) analyze archival data (49 per cent);  and (4) were published in the journals Academy of Manage-  ment Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, and Strategic  Management Journal (37.30 per cent) (see Figure 2). Interest-  ingly, two different lines of inquiry started to develop as  well. One group examined the antecedents of board’s stra-  tegic involvement (Zahra, 1990; Zahra and Pearce, 1990;  Judge and Zeithaml, 1992; Fried et al., 1998). A second group  investigated the effects of the relationship between board  and TMTs on strategic decision making (Bradshaw-Camball  and Murray, 1991; Fried and Hisrich, 1995; Judge and  Dobbins, 1995; Westphal, 1998; Gulati and Westphal, 1999).  At the end of the 1990s, contributions by Forbes and Mil-  liken (1999), McNulty and Pettigrew (1999), and Rindova  (1999) opened up the debate on boards’ contribution to strat-  egy processes and led to a new avenue of research in this  area.  Period 3 (2001–2007): Towards More Pluralism in the  Board–Strategy Debate. As witnessed by the sharp  increase in the average number of papers published each  year (9.60), research on boards and strategy gained even  more momentum during this period. These years are char-  acterized by the co-existence of different research  approaches. Most studies still focus on the determinants and  consequences of board’s strategic involvement (47 per cent),  use archival data (36 per cent) in a US setting (49 per cent),  and extensively refer to agency theory (42 per cent). At the  same time, studies with different features emerged in this  period. First, empirical studies drawing on non-US data  become more frequent. For example, the corporate gover-  nance contexts of Australia (Bonn and Fisher, 2005), Belgium  (Van den Heuvel, Van Gils and Voordeckers, 2005), Italy  (Zona and Zattoni, 2007), Japan (Yoshikawa and Phan, 2005),  New Zealand (Ingley and Van Der Walt, 2005), Norway  (Huse, Minichilli and Shoning, 2005), and the United  Kingdom (Long, Dulewicz and Gay, 2005; Yawson, 2006)  were examined. Second, new theoretical standpoints have  been used to interpret phenomena (Hendry and Kiel, 2004;  Keenan, 2004) and most of the published articles do not refer  to agency theory but to alternate theoretical lenses (58 per  cent).  Building upon earlier contributions by Forbes and Mil-  liken (1999), McNulty and Pettigrew (1999), and Rindova  (1999), research on boards and strategy is also characterized  by the emergence of behavioral and cognitive approaches.  Studies in this tradition aim to understand how boards par-  ticipate in strategic decision making as an active part of it  (Stiles and Taylor, 1996). Based on this approach, Jensen and  Zajac (2004) and Useem and Zelleke (2006) highlight that  boards participate in these processes through continuously  interacting with managers and/or other stakeholders. More-  over, Rindova (1999), and Fiegener (2005) argue that a board  of directors’ work is not limited to ratification and monitor-  ing only (cf. Fama and Jensen, 1983); boards of directors  should rather be involved in all phases. Furthermore,  Mueller, Sillince, Harvey and Howorth (2003) underline the  conflicting requirements boards of directors face in fulfilling  the monitoring role (independence) and the strategy role  (involvement). Scholars have also started to investigate the  joint impact of board dynamics, working style, and structure  on strategic issues (Golden and Zajac, 2001; Huse, 2005), as  well as how the expertise, abilities, and network ties of  board members affect their ability and motivation to contrib-  ute to strategy formulation (Carpenter and Westphal, 2001;  Roberts, 2002; Hillman, 2005) and the board of directors’  overall capacity to impact on CEOs and TMTs (Westphal and  Fredrickson, 2001; Arthaud-Day, Certo, Dalton, and Dalton,  2006; Grossman and Cannella, 2006).  DISCUSSION  Over the last four decades, the interest in research on the  relationship between boards of directors and strategy has  grown significantly (see Figure 1). Scholars and practitioners  have extensively discussed the potential contribution of  boards as well as the desirability or undesirability of active  boards in this domain. Witnessing pluralism and contro-  300 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  Volume 17 Number 3 May 2009 © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  versy in the literature on boards and strategy in terms of  theoretical underpinnings and empirical findings, our  review provides insights on previous research contributions  illustrating the way in which the literature evolved, high-  lighting implications for both scholars and practitioners,  and suggesting avenues for future research. In particular,  our results highlight two important trends in literature on  boards and strategy.  First, our findings illustrate that research on boards of  directors and strategy developed from normative and struc-  tural approaches to behavioral and cognitive approaches  (see Figures 3 and 4). While early studies mainly discussed  the desirability of board’s strategic involvement (Period 1)  and used “input-output” approaches (Period 2), a more  recent line of research posits boards as decision-making  groups whose internal processes and external context  should be better understood (e.g., Forbes and Milliken, 1999;  McNulty and Pettigrew, 1999; Huse, 2005; Ravasi and  Zattoni, 2006). This evolution is in line with the general  shift in strategic management from studying “strategy as  content” to understanding “strategy as process and context”  (cf. Pettigrew et al., 2002).  Second, our results highlight that research questions,  theories, settings, and sources of data interact and influence  our insights about the relationship between boards and  strategy (see Figure 3). On the one hand, most empirical  studies analyze US companies, refer to agency theory,  examine the role of boards with regard to specific outcomes,  and use archival data as the main source of data. On the other  hand, a relatively limited number of studies analyze non-US  companies, define board’s strategic involvement as boards’  participation in decision making, and use qualitative  methods (cf. Deutsch, 2005).  Theoretical Implications  Our study has several scholarly implications and highlights  avenues for future research. First, our results reveal the need  to understand the role of context at multiple levels as (1)  most of the contemporary wisdom originates from US  samples of large public companies; and (2) comparative cor-  porate governance studies are sparse (see Figure 3). As a  result, the impact of the national setting (e.g., the legal  system, culture, and economic conditions) and firm charac-  teristics (e.g., the ownership structure, board structure, firm  performance, and life-cycle) on the relationship between  boards and strategy is not fully understood (Aguilera and  Cuervo-Cazurra, 2004; Ravasi and Zattoni, 2006; Hambrick,  v. Werder and Zajac, 2008). For example, as the majority of  studies referring to agency theory used US samples and  “input-outcome approaches,” the application of agency  theory to strategic decision-making processes in different  national contexts may lead to the discovery of new theoreti-  cal and empirical issues (Peck and Ruigrok, 2000). Further-  more, the growing number of studies that define board’s  strategic involvement as participation in strategic decision  making may stimulate more dynamic theories and promote  research designs explicitly investigating the changing con-  tributions of boards of directors over time (cf. Ravasi and  Zattoni, 2006). In sum, multi-level approaches and interna-  tional comparative corporate governance studies may con-  tribute to the development of a better understanding of  interactions between macro, meso, and micro dynamics and  how these forces jointly shape the relationship between  boards of directors and strategy (Volberda et al., 2001; Vol-  berda and Lewin, 2003; Hambrick et al., 2008).  Second, our results highlight the number and variety of  theoretical perspectives and inconclusive empirical find-  ings. More recently, scholars emphasized the need to go  beyond structuralism and to examine board processes,  board behavior, and directors’ cognition. This movement  encourages scholars to investigate what boards and their  members actually do, think, and/or perceive (Pettigrew,  1992; Lawrence, 1997; Forbes and Milliken, 1999). Although  our literature review shows an increasing interest in these  topics, the number of studies in this area is still rather  limited. Given the importance of understanding politics and  bargaining processes between key actors (cf. Bradshaw-  Camball and Murray, 1991; Ravasi and Zattoni, 2006; Parker,  2007) and the impact of overlapping and conflicting prefer-  ences within and between groups of actors (Hambrick et al.,  2008), a considerable amount of research remains to be done  in this area in order to clarify and improve our understand-  ing of the board of directors’ contribution to strategy  making. For example, future studies should investigate the  interaction between large shareholders, board members,  and top management teams inside and outside board meet-  ings (Useem and Zelleke, 2006). To reach this purpose, gov-  ernance scholars are encouraged to open the black box of  board research, developing longitudinal studies aimed at  exploring processes over an extensive time period and col-  lecting primary data using interviews, surveys and direct  observation techniques (Pettigrew et al., 2002; Huse, 2005).  Practical Implications  Our empirical findings have also implications for practitio-  ners. First, the increasing attention to boards’ contribution to  strategy echoes a movement towards more board’s strategic  involvement. Interestingly, this development seems to be  conflicting with principles from agency theory that consider  decision control as the primary role of boards of directors (cf.  Fama and Jensen, 1983). Based on principles from agency  theory, governance recommendations and best practices  have generally encouraged independence and formality  between independent directors and executive directors  (Huse, 1994; van Hamel, van Wijk, de Rooij and Bruel, 1998;  Sundaramurthy and Lewis, 2003). This view has been rein-  forced after each wave of corporate governance scandals, as  reform initiatives (such as SOX, EU directives, and national  corporate governance codes) have generally emphasized  board control and board independence as key mechanisms  to ensure corporate accountability (Daily et al., 2003: Enrione  et al., 2006). However, clearly separating decision control  from decision management might pose a serious threat to a  board’s ability to perform its strategic role (Bezemer et al.,  2007). Scholars have highlighted that the maintenance of  openness, proactiveness, and a focus on joint value creation  are important antecedents of the board’s contribution to the  strategic decision-making process (Zona and Zattoni, 2007).  Moreover, an effective contribution of board members to  strategy requires both an adequate composition and struc-  BOARDS OF DIRECTORS’ CONTRIBUTION TO STRATEGY 301  Volume 17 Number 3 May 2009© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  ture, and well-organized internal processes (Minichilli,  Zattoni and Zona, 2009). Furthermore, the introduction of  governance practices, such as board induction programs and  annual board reviews, may contribute to an increased aware-  ness of the expected contribution of boards to strategy  (Huse, 2005). In sum, an increase in the directors’ awareness  of their strategic function should be associated with a higher  consideration from regulators–board composition and  processes should be designed to allow all members of the  board to contribute to strategic decision making (Roberts,  McNulty and Stiles, 2005).  Second, practitioners should be aware that most of the  contemporary wisdom originates from a limited set of  empirical contexts. As there may be important differences  across contexts in terms of role expectations, board struc-  tures, and actors, practitioners should be careful in applying  practices in their own national context (Bamberg, 2008;  Hambrick et al., 2008). The witnessed theoretical and empiri-  cal pluralism in the board–strategy literature is supportive  in this respect.  Limitations  Our literature review has several limitations. First, in this  review only 81 journals in the management domain were  included. There could be further research potential in inves-  tigating to what extent journals in other research fields (e.g.,  most notably finance, accounting, and law) have contributed  to research on boards and strategy. Second, in this study we  solely focused on published articles which explicitly men-  tioned the search terms “director” or “board” together  with “strateg*” in their title, abstract, and/or keywords. By  choosing this exploratory approach, one risks missing  important papers that do not claim to be in this domain  explicitly and/or refer to strategic content directly. Future  studies could examine to what extent our findings hold  when a broader definition is employed (i.e., “governance”  and “strateg*”). Third, as a result of the above choices,  leading books on the topic were not included in our statis-  tical analysis (e.g., Demb and Neubauer, 1992; Charan, 1998;  Conger et al., 2001; Stiles and Taylor, 2002; Leblanc and  Gillies, 2005; Huse, 2007). Future studies could assess how  other types of publication (e.g., academic books and consul-  tancy reports) have contributed to the development of the  board–strategy field. However, we believe that also this limi-  tation should not be overemphasized as our analysis  includes both academic and practitioner journals.  CONCLUSION  Our review of the literature on boards and strategy revealed  that research on the contribution of boards of directors to  strategy has rapidly developed and expanded in the last four  decades. Several changes are observable across different  periods in terms of the questions addressed and the  methods applied. The growing attention witnessed in this  review can be ascribed both to new challenges companies  face in multiple contexts and to the theoretical advance-  ments in the fields of strategic management and corporate  governance. Nevertheless, the proliferation of studies and  the increasing call for more contributions have not provided  a clear answer to the question of how boards of directors  contribute to strategy. Despite all the endeavors undertaken  in the past, we highlight that the debate on boards and  strategy still provides a very promising and challenging  research agenda. Corporate governance scholars are encour-  aged to open the black box of board research in order to  develop a better understanding of the interactions between  macro, meso, and micro dynamics, and how these forces  jointly shape the relationship between boards of directors  and strategy.

BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT, VOL. 7, 24–31 (1998)  BUFFERING AND BRIDGING AS  ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGIES  OF FIRMS  F. A. J. van den Bosch* and C. B. M. van Riel  Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands  Companies are often confronted with  important strategic issues, such as  environmental concerns. Generally, they  react in one of two basic ways: buffering  the enterprise or bridging the issue.  Insight into the factors determining the  choice between those two generic  strategies is important for managers.  Three recent and mutually related  analytical frameworks from corporate  communication and management theory  are discussed and exemplified by the  Shell Brent Spar case. This case shows  the development of two generic  environmental strategies over time: initial  buffering of the firm from external  stakeholders, and later a shift towards a  bridging strategy. On the basis of our  theoretical and empirical analysis, it  appears that top management’s attitude  regarding cooperation with external  stakeholders plays a key role in choosing  bridging versus buffering strategies.  ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and  ERP Environment.

Buffering strategies are used by manage-  ment to help seal off the firm from disturbances in  the business environment due to, for example, the  environmental impacts of a firm’s activities. A  buffering strategy is aimed at preventing external  stakeholders from interfering in internal oper-  ations. Buffering strategies amplify the organiz-  ation’s protective boundaries and are aimed at  reducing uncertainty (Scott, 1987). Bridging strat-  egies seek to adapt organizational activities in  such a way that they conform to the expectations  of external stakeholders regarding, for instance,  environmental aspects of a firm’s activities.  According to Scott (1987, p. 185): ‘Bridging  strategies are oriented towards enhancing the  security of the organization in relation to its  environment. Safety, survival and an improved  bargaining position are the prizes that motivate  bridge building. . . .’  This article first discusses three recently pub-  lished, and mutually related analytical frame-  works, with regard to bridging and buffering.  Particular attention is paid to the key propositions  of these frameworks. Next, these propositions are  exemplified by the Brent Spar case, dealing with  the highly controversial proposal of Shell UK,  *Correspondence to: Professor Frans A.

The case description ends in March 1996  and is based on publicly available data. This case  is especially suited to exemplify how analytical  frameworks can explain certain decisions made  by managers regarding environmental issues. In  conclusion we show that such an analysis can help  both managers and researchers to gain more  insight into the factors that may determine buff-  ering and bridging as two generic environmental  strategies.  THREE RECENT ANALYTICAL  FRAMEWORKS DEALING WITH  BUFFERING AND BRIDGING  STRATEGIES  Increasingly, companies sell not only products or  services, but the ways in which they are pro-  duced. This trend is especially applicable to indus-  trial enterprises taking observable risks with their  production processes. Companies can handle this  problem in one of two basic ways (Scott, 1987). In  bridging, the company creates relationships with  the external stakeholders on which it is depen-  dent. In buffering, it tries to keep the external  stakeholders at a distance, using buffering tech-  niques (Meznar and Nigh, 1995). Between buffer-  ing and bridging as generic strategies there are  different variants, such as mixed strategies which  indicate the extent to which companies are pre-  pared either to bridge or buffer in relation to these  stakeholders. Schot (1992) discerned five different  types of strategy: dependent, defensive, offensive,  innovative and niche. Buffering strategies are  related to a defensive strategy in which ‘Solutions  are sought mainly in technology and not in  organisation’ (Schot, 1992, p. 42). Bridging strat-  egies could be related to an innovative strategy  (Schot, 1992, p. 43) in which the key is ‘. . . cre-  ating organisational conditions for synergy in the  field of the environment between all actors in  the strategic network both inside and outside the  company . . .’. As noted by Schot (1992), various  elements of these five strategies can be observed  in combination. Bridging and buffering strategies  are not mutually exclusive. This paper, however,  will focus on the two generic strategies and not  on mixed strategies.  Corporate Communication Styles  Companies use a continuum of communication  styles. At one extreme is corporate silence (van  Riel, 1994) which is the most passive communi-  cation strategy a company can use. More active  styles use the press agency approach (this term  refers to a one-way communication style that  informs but is primarily aimed at convincing  others of being right), to increasingly open com-  munication – such as a two-way asymmetrical  model or a two-way symmetrical model of cor-  porate communication (Grunig and Hunt, 1984;  Grunig, 1992). These communication styles differ  due to the divergent perceptions of managers  regarding whether an organization must negotiate  and communicate with external stakeholders, and  is dependent on these stakeholders to obtain and  keep access to the resources which are necessary  in its primary process. According to Grunig  (1992, p. 285–325) three factors positively deter-  mine an organization’s tendency to follow a  bridging strategy:  • developments in the business environment that  are perceived as threatening;  • communication managers have a strong voice  within a firm;  • the organization’s culture is characterized by  participative decision making.  Bridging and Buffering  To the extent a company considers itself depen-  dent on external stakeholders (Matten, 1995),  who are able to deny or grant access to the re-  sources the company needs (Pfeffer and Salancik,  1978), it employs a strategy which focuses more  on bridging than on buffering. Preferences for  bridging or buffering seem to depend largely on  three organizational characteristics, labelled as  determinants in the theoretical and empirical  research by Meznar and Nigh (1995, p. 990–991):  • The single most important determinant in  explaining a firm’s buffering behaviour is its  size.  • The importance of the resources controlled by  a firm positively influence its propensity to  buffer.  • A collaborative, pioneering attitude of a firm’s  top management is the most important deter-  minant of a firm’s bridging behaviour.  The first determinant is the size of the organ-  isation, measured on the basis of balance sheet  total and number of employees. This determinant  seems, quantitatively, to be the most important  determinant in Meznar and Nigh’s research for  explaining the choice of a buffering strategy. The  BUFFERING AND BRIDGING STRATEGIES  ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment. Bus. Strat. Env., Vol. 7, 24–31 (1998)  25BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT  second determinant is the importance of the  resources controlled by firms. If a firm provides a  vital good that cannot easily be replaced, it is  more likely to buffer itself.  The most important determinant regarding the  choice of a bridging strategy appears to be the  positive attitude by top management with respect  to cooperation with external stakeholders. Dis-  cussing the statistically supported empirical find-  ings of their analytical framework, Meznar and  Nigh (1995, p. 991) conclude: ‘A collaborative  pioneering philosophy on the part of a firm’s top  management was the strongest predictor of bridg-  ing strategies.’ Of these three determinants, the  attitude of top management towards cooperation  with external stakeholders is the only way in  which management itself is able to have an  influence. However, before management attempts  a strategy of bridging, it must recognize the  fundamental differences between its own insider  (or management) perspective and the outsider (or  external) stakeholder perspective.  Insider Versus Outsider View  There often appears to be a gap between the  perceptions of managers and those of external  stakeholders who follow the company move-  ments critically (Matten, 1995). Crucial to under-  standing this gap is the manager’s apparent  inability to find adequate ways in explaining to  external stakeholders why some strategic issues,  based on a technical justification, will be handled  or have been handled in a certain way. Manage-  ment of strategic issues becomes effective only  when managers realize that external stakeholders  do not always have the knowledge, or the will-  ingness to be open to objective consideration of  the advantages, disadvantages and risks of de-  cision needed to be taken by a company (Adams,  1992). Dunbar and Ahlstrom’s (1995, p. 173)  distinction between insider and outsider perspec-  tives is helpful in understanding the above-  mentioned gap: insiders are the members of an  organization, and everybody else is an outsider.  Insider views tend to be pragmatic and to reflect  the established ways of doing things by the organ-  ization. Outsider perspectives are less limited,  and will query whether the outputs of the target  organization are really wanted and, if not, how and  from whom can the required outputs be obtained.  Based on the alternative perspectives of insiders  and outsiders, Dunbar and Ahlstrom (1995,  p. 174–178) developed a number of propositions:  1. Relative to outsiders, insiders have less appre-  ciation of the broader range of expectations  that outsiders have for their organization and  its outputs. Outsiders socially construct shared  views of how to assess and compare target  organization outputs based on universal cri-  teria. Relative to insiders, outsiders have less  appreciation of the process details that insiders  must manage in order to deliver the outputs  that outsiders require.  2. Commitments to insiders’ views at the exclu-  sion of outsiders’ views are associated with (a)  assertions of unique insider knowledge of prac-  tice that outsiders do not appreciate and (b)  denials that such knowledge and contri-  butions can adequately be assessed in terms of  universal effectiveness, efficiency and fairness  measures.  3. Commitments to outsiders’ views at the exclu-  sion of insider’s views are associated with (a)  assertions of the need to apply universal cri-  teria of effectiveness, efficiency, and fairness  with which to evaluate and make resource  allocations, and (b) denials that a focus on local  contexts is appropriate.  4. Competing insiders and outsiders support their  claims by highlighting qualifications and the  effectiveness of their approaches and by deny-  ing those advocated by the other side.  5. Competing insiders and outsiders look for  support from neutral outsiders and emphasize  shared concerns. Issues subject to competition  are further fragmented. Actions on the original  issues become increasingly more difficult to  take.  These propositions suggest the predicted dif-  ferences in approaches between an insider and an  outsider perspectives. Managerial understanding  of how to perceive and treat these differences is of  great importance for the well-considered choice  of bridging or buffering strategies.  Of particular interest are the factors that stipu-  late the ways in which top management is open to  cooperation with external stakeholders. For co-  operation to occur, however, top management  must not try to bridge the difference between its  own perspective and the outsiders’ perspective  through a competitive power struggle. Dunbar  and Ahlstrom (1995) suggest top management  should avoid further escalation and the partici-  pation of neutral third parties. They recommend  the use of a pro-active approach of communication  to outsiders, so that insiders are better able to  understand the views of outsiders. Furthermore,  VAN DEN BOSCH AND VAN RIEL  Bus. Strat. Env., Vol. 7, 24–31 (1998)? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.  26 BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT  they indicate (1995, p. 188) it is necessary for  managers to ‘help design evaluation criteria that  will enable outsiders to make assessments that  are fair and just to all producers while ensuring  outsiders also get the best available outputs’.  BRENT SPAR CASE: FACTS  Company Size and Structure  The Royal Dutch/Shell Group is one of the largest  companies in the world, both in terms of market  volume and profits. In the Global 1000 ranking  (Business Week, July 8, 1996) the company is  number two in market volume and number one in  profits. Despite its high profits in recent years,  Shell has recently implemented a major restructur-  ing process, which led to important personnel  reductions at its operating companies. During this  process the organization and coordination struc-  ture within the group remained unchanged. How-  ever, in March 1995 the CEO of the Dutch parent  company announced that the Group wished to  drastically change its organizational structure. The  old matrix structure, with regions, sectors and  functional responsibilities, as well as coordinating  tasks by service rendering companies, would dis-  appear. The proposed new structure consisted of  four separate business organizations, each led by  a business committee with world-wide responsi-  bility. A newly created strategy and business  services unit, would control strategy, finance,  personnel and public affairs activities at the group  level. This unit renders services to business com-  mittees and operating companies. The public  affairs activities would be more centralized after  these changes. By abolishing its complicated  matrix structure, Shell hopes to make its top-level  decision making more simplified and stream-  lined. The operating companies, however, remain  the principal entities through which the group’s  businesses are conducted.  Research into Brent Spar Removal  When in 1991 the oil storage and loading station  Brent Spar was decommissioned by Shell Expro  (a joint venture of Shell and Exxon), an extensive  investigation was initiated in order to find alter-  native solutions for removal. In 1993 and 1994  several salvage companies, engineering firms and  institutes delivered over 30 reports, regarding this  project. The final conclusion was clear: after  cleaning and removal of as much of the waste  and loose materials as possible, sinking the Brent  Spar in the ocean was the safest, cheapest, and  least environmentally damaging method of  removal. Several Scottish institutions, including  the Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish  Association for Marine Science, agreed to sink the  construction in the North Fenni Ridge. Following  discussions with British authorities and govern-  ments of all countries bordering the North Sea  and the East Atlantic Ocean, no objections were  submitted.  Greenpeace Versus Shell  However, after lengthy internal discussions, the  environmental activist’s organization Greenpeace  decided to attack Shell’s decision to sink the  Brent Spar. Following the ‘save our seas’ action,  Greenpeace published the environmental dangers  posed by Brent Spar. According to Greenpeace,  Brent Spar contained tons of oil sediment and tons  of low-level radioactive deposits, and it asserted  that this mixture of poisonous, nondegradable  chemicals and heavy metals would be a serious  threat to the sea environment. Furthermore,  Greenpeace suggested sinking the Brent Spar into  the ocean would establish a precedent for the  other 416 fixed oil platforms in the North Sea, and  that the permission by the British government to  sink the Brent Spar in the sea had been given on  the basis of limited and one-sided information.  Greenpeace’s thesis, that dumping the Brent  Spar would establish a precedent, was rejected by  Shell. The granted permit clearly indicated that in  case of the Brent Spar sinking was the best option,  but that all other cases needed to be judged  separately. According to Shell, the Brent Spar was  difficult to dismantle. To transport it, Shell would  have to turn the installation horizontally, and  there was a substantial risk the structure would  break when turned, creating risks for the safety of  people and environment. In contrast, it appeared  the environmental effects of sinking the construc-  tion in 2 km deep water did little harm. There is  hardly any sea life at this depth and, according to  Shell, any leaks of oily residue would be highly  diluted. It contended that at least 90% of the  sediment was sand and only a small part of the  sediment was heavy, stable oil residue: a compo-  sition comparable to road asphalt. Greenpeace  did not believe Shell’s statements and decided to  start actions aimed at altering Shell’s decision.  Several environmental interest groups called  upon consumers to boycott Shell’s products. In  some countries, such as Germany, the consumer  BUFFERING AND BRIDGING STRATEGIES  ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment. Bus. Strat. Env., Vol. 7, 24–31 (1998)  27BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT  boycott was successful, and emotional reactions  in many European countries to Shell’s decision,  especially in Germany and Denmark, acquired  general support. Rational arguments for sinking  the Brent Spar into the ocean no longer mattered.  The Brent Spar became a symbol of unacceptable  corporate behaviour towards the environment.  In June 1995 the campaign against Shell’s Brent  Spar plan escalated, mostly due to the Dutch  Minister for Economic Affairs and a number of  German and Danish prominent politicians who  publicly admitted they were avoiding Shell  stations. The German chancellor Helmut Kohl  criticized Shell and threatened to bring the Brent  Spar issue before a G7 conference. On 16 June  1995, Prime Minister John Major defended Shell  to Helmut Kohl and G7 (Financial Times, 21 June  1995). When Greenpeace decided to publish an  advertisement with the slogan ‘the sea is not a  garbage can’, Shell chose an advocacy advertise-  ment, but again did so with an insiders’ view. It  placed a full-page advertisement in all main Dutch  newspapers, but this effort had little success in  changing the views of Dutch citizens. About 80%  of those questioned in The Netherlands said that  the advertisement did not influence their opinion  (Shell Post, 21 Aug 1995). A substantial decrease  of sales in Germany forced the company to place  an advertisement in German papers with the  heading ‘Wir werden uns ändern’ (We will  change). Shell’s search for public legitimacy had  clearly failed. An interesting analysis of the re-  lationship between environmental information  provided by business and building trust is given  by Eden (1993).  Decision Not to Sink  Shell’s top management was confronted with  intensified internal controversies. In line with  company policy, Shell UK was responsible for the  decisions about Brent Spar. Shell’s top managers  of national organizations outside Great Britain  started to be openly concerned about the sinking  of the Brent Spar. These internal controversies  made it extremely difficult for the top manage-  ment of the Group and Shell UK to justify the  original plan to the public. These controversies  between Shell UK on the one hand and the  German, Dutch and Scandinavian national organ-  izations on the other hand, increased the pressure  within Shell against sinking the Brent Spar. On 20  June 1995, Shell’s top management decided not to  sink the Brent Spar. Following this decision Shell  UK asked a well known verification organization  to conduct independent research into the contents  of the former oil storage and loading station. This  research indicated that the Brent Spar possessed  less poisonous material than suggested by  Greenpeace. The environmental organization was  prepared to admit this and to offer its public  apologies to Shell early in September 1995. In  early 1996 the chairman of Shell Nederland BV  stated that action groups should produce their  own code of conduct, so that it would be easier  for outsiders to control the information they  spread, its correctness and truthfulness. (NRC  Handelsblad, 1996).  COMPARISON OF BRENT SPAR WITH  ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORKS  The question as to which factors can explain  why Shell’s management emphasized a buffering  strategy in the Brent Spar case is central to this  section. From the case description it is tentatively  inferred that Shell used a buffering strategy dur-  ing the period described above (ending in March  1996). However, two comments are appropriate  regarding this conclusion. First, a more detailed  description of the events during that period could  give a finer grained picture, in which tendencies to  bridging interchange with those of buffering.  Second, although Shell is described above from a  single (insider) perspective, it appears that not all  Shell operating companies in different countries  were in agreement, and different opinions were  communicated to their respective business en-  vironments with regard to the desirability of  bridging versus buffering.  The first proposition by Grunig (1992) is illus-  trated by this case. Only at the end of the period  discussed did the business environment become  threatening to Shell’s management and, according  to the reactions from the managers of the various  European operating companies, was perceived as  such. With regard to the role of the communi-  cation managers having a strong position within a  company – Grunig’s second proposition – it can  be concluded from the recent reorganization that  the new structure contributed to an increase of  influence of public affairs specialists in decision  making, such as Brent Spar. The third proposition  is not taken further here, due to insufficient data  being available.  Application of the three determinants of  Meznar and Nigh (1995) to the Brent Spar case  leads to the following findings. The first  VAN DEN BOSCH AND VAN RIEL  Bus. Strat. Env., Vol. 7, 24–31 (1998)? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.  28 BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT  determinant, i.e. size, positively relates the large  size of a company to a buffering strategy. This  appears to describe Shell’s actions, as the com-  pany is one of the largest in the world. Large  international vertically integrated oil companies  such as Shell, play a key role in the world  energy supply. The importance of the resources  controlled by Shell positively influence the pro-  pensity to buffer. Therefore, the second determi-  nant (resource importance) seems to create a  propensity to a buffering strategy. The willing-  ness of top management to cooperate with  external stakeholders (the third determinant) in  this case seems to have been rather low, as  no inclination to a bridging strategy appeared  during the period described.  Further insight into Meznar and Nigh’s final  determinant is provided by the five propositions  of Dunbar and Ahlstrom (1995). The first two  propositions are corroborated by the facts of  the case study. Shell paid more attention to the  processes concentrating on the sinking of the  Brent Spar. Greenpeace, however, stuck to  the opinion that ‘the sea is not a garbage can’.  Shell showed less commitment to this outsider’s  view, and emphasized its company-specific  knowledge and experience with oil platforms  and the importance of opinions from external  specialists in this field. With their approaches,  Shell and Greenpeace illustrate the third and  fourth propositions. It also appears from the  case description that Shell’s management  became involved in a struggle between Shell’s  insider perspective and Greenpeace’s outsider  perspective, whereby both parties, conforming  to proposition 5, used third parties to support  their perspective. As argued by Dunbar and  Ahlstrom, this is due to neglect of the one-  sidedness of both the insider and outsider per-  spectives. Based on the analysis of Meznar and  Nigh, this means Shell’s top management was  more inclined to use a buffering strategy with  respect to this issue. As discussed earlier, this  tendency is enhanced by the influence of the  second determinant (the importance of the  product) and the first determinant (the size of  the company involved).  Managerial Clues  The above-mentioned results suggest the follow-  ing question. Assuming that Shell’s management  had initially wished to adopt a bridging strategy,  what managerial clues can be derived from this  case study as to how to effect such a strategy?  The analysis suggests top management itself  plays a key role. Top management needs to  acknowledge that the first two of Meznar and  Nigh’s (1995) determinants, i.e. the size of the  company and resource importance, influence an  organization towards using a buffering strategy.  On the basis of the analysis, this tendency  towards buffering can be changed only by the  top management’s openness to cooperation with  external stakeholders. The acknowledgement of  this key role by top management is a necessary  condition for bridging the inherent difference  between insider and outsider perspectives.  CONCLUSION AND  RECOMMENDATION FOR FURTHER  RESEARCH  This article has investigated analytical frame-  works dealing with buffering and bridging as  two generic environmental strategies. From a  management perspective, these frameworks  suggest top management’s attitude regarding  cooperation with external stakeholders is of key  importance. A prerequisite for such an attitude,  however, is the understanding of fundamental  differences between insider (i.e. management)  and outsider (i.e. external stakeholder) perspec-  tives. The juxtaposition of theory with practice  resulted in an increased insight into the expla-  nation of Shell’s buffering strategy in this case.  Two important company-specific determinants,  namely the importance of the product and the  size of the company, influence the company’s  tendency to adopt such a strategy. On the  basis of this analysis, it is plausible that the key  for the choice of a bridging strategy, as opposed  to the discussed buffering strategy in the Brent  Spar case, is in the hands of top management.  To substantiate this finding, there are three  observations regarding a company’s move  towards a bridging strategy. First is the pre-  viously mentioned statement from Shell’s top  management that environmental interest groups  should formulate a code of conduct in actions  against third parties. An insider (Shell) points to  the foundations of an outsider’s (in particular  Greenpeace’s) existence, namely the necessity of  handling general valid norms of what is permitted  by judging company decisions.  Second, top management (Shell, 1995) refer to  the rejection of the proposed deep-water disposal  of the Brent Spar and conclude:  BUFFERING AND BRIDGING STRATEGIES  ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment. Bus. Strat. Env., Vol. 7, 24–31 (1998)  29BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT  We learned in 1995 we needed to have  greater external focus if we were to create a  better acceptance of the Group’s business  among varied audiences. Group companies  must consult, inform and communicate better  with the public. In such a dialogue they will  need to point out the complexity of the issues  and always balance human, environmental  and economic considerations.  Finally, in October 1996 the chairman of  the Committee of Managing Directors of the  Royal Dutch/Shell Group again reflects in public  on the Brent Spar experience (Herkströter, 1996,  p. 3):  To gain a greater understanding of the  changes, we have found that we have to  communicate more, both internally and ex-  ternally. . . . We were, perhaps, excessively  focused on internal matters, and we failed  to fully understand the need to provide  information to the general public.  On the basis of the analysis presented here, these  observations can be considered as indicating the  start of a bridging strategy being initiated by  Shell’s top management. The importance of  top management as a key factor determining the  choice between bridging versus buffering as  environmental strategies of firms is once more  highlighted.  In conclusion, top management seem to be a  key factor in determining the choice between  bridging or buffering environmental strategies of  firms. However, further research is needed to gain  more insight into this factor. In this connection, it  seems appropriate to investigate the influence of  the type of corporate-level strategy in use (Porter,  1987; Goold et al., 1994; Van den Bosch and De  Man, 1997), and the organizational structure in  relation to the process of strategy formation and  decision making in large companies (Mintzberg,  1994). This would generate greater insight into  the influence of organizational and management  processes on bridging and buffering. Follow-up  research along these lines could show that  although top management is and remains respon-  sible for the choice between buffering and  bridging strategies, existing organizational and  management processes can make such choices  difficult to implement in the short term. Changing  these processes may be a prerequisite for bridg-  ing, as a sustainable environmental strategy for  firms.

Volberda  The emergence of electronic commerce raises important questions about the building  and leveraging of legitimacy for both practitioners and scholars of strategy. New  entrants’ click-and-mortar or click-and-click business models are challenging the  legitimacy of large and mature brick-and-mortar incumbents. The implications of this  challenge for the financial services industry—as for many other industries—are only  starting to become clear. This article contributes to these initial understandings by  developing a conceptual framework that considers which e-strategies ‘bricks’  (incumbent organisations such as ABN AMRO bank and Prudential Banking) and ‘clicks’  (new entrants such as KPN and First-e) adopt to improve their competitiveness. Four  relevant organisational types in the emerging online financial services industry are  identified, and ties to legitimacy-providing organisations are assessed for their potential  both as buffers against environmental turbulence and bridges towards changing  stakeholder perspectives.  c 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

New markets are being created, industry boundaries  blurred and product meanings redefined. Established incum-  bents—‘bricks and mortar’ companies—are finding themselves  confronted with new business opportunities in a virtual mar-  ketspace of dynamically developing information interactions, as  opposed to a marketplace of physical resources and institutional-  ised interactions.1 New e-commerce industries are emerging in  which bricks-and-mortar incumbents compete with new entrants  0024-6301/01/$ - see front matter  c 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To be successful in an emerging e-commerce industry, ‘bricks’  (incumbents in the marketplace) and ‘clicks’ (entrants in the  Internet marketspace) have to clear some liabilities that hold  them back. As organisational age is often associated with the  inability to change, bricks suffer from the liability of age  (oldness), tending to develop only to the limit of their adaptive  competence. Clicks, on the on the other hand, suffer from the  liability of youth (newness), where, as in the natural world, any  developing life form is at its weakest at the point of birth. Which  liability will lay the heaviest burden, offering bricks or clicks the  ability to gain the upper hand? Can either outperform the other?  Or will cooperation between both parties be the key to success?  This article addresses these questions by developing a simple con-  ceptual framework describing how new entrants and incumbents  in the financial services industry influence each other and can  evolve reciprocally—co-evolve—to create the future online fin-  ancial services industry.  The strategic interactions between Amazon.com and Barnes  and Noble Inc. in the book selling industry provide a vivid illus-  tration of the co-evolutionary perspective2 on the entrant-incum-  bent dynamic. In 1995 Amazon.com’s customer-centric click  strategy allowed it to develop a customer base that now exceeds  25 million people, taking bricks-and-mortar Barnes and Noble  by surprise. Responding to Amazon.com’s disruptive strategy,  Barnes and Noble spun off a click subsidiary (Bn.com), and for-  med a partnership with the Internet portal Yahoo Inc. to be its  featured book seller. This strategic move enabled Barnes and  Noble to reap the fruits of bricks and clicks synergies, returning  pressure on Amazon.com, which now not only faces the chal-  lenge of reasserting its customer-centric lead as a click, but also  of yielding profits on the scale of its brick counterparts.  The emerging online financial services industry  There are several reasons for focusing on the emergence of an  online financial services industry. Banking and insurance are  mature industries, long subject to strong institutional control,  and traditionally protected by high entry barriers.3 However, they  now find themselves facing increasing environmental turbulence.    Deregulation and the increasing importance of ICT  (information and communication technology) are removing  entry barriers.4    Regulatory approval is speedier and more certain, and the  investments necessary to scale up operations are falling.5    Electronic banking operating expenses are estimated at only  25 to 30 per cent of the cost of providing traditional banking  services through bricks and mortar branch offices.6    Customer awareness about financial products is soaring.7  The opportunity would seem to exist for click entrants to take  advantage of this changing environment by challenging brick  incumbents with new and disruptive methods of competition,8  and many banking industry analysts predict that power in the  retail financial services sector will shift very soon to innovative  entrants offering an attractive, efficient and customer-centric  consumer banking interface.9 On the other hand, other analysts  believe traditional national and historical protection and prefer-  ences will favour incumbents, and delay change.10  Apart from offering a superior customer proposition, click  entrants need to develop strategies aimed at increasing their legit-  imacy. It is important to note that legitimacy is not the same as  branding, but is more closely aligned to notions of credibility  and stability, signalling to the outside world that an organisation  is safe, trustworthy, predictable, socially acceptable, desirable  and ethical.11  Entrants’ claims for click legitimacy (legitimacy in the Internet  marketspace) are more credible than those of their brick rivals.  To counter these claims, incumbents need to adapt to the  demands of the changing environment, demonstrating their  legitimacy in the new world of the Internet. Conversely, entrants  lack the brick legitimacy (legitimacy in the traditional  marketplace) of incumbent banks, forcing them to take into  account taken-for-granted brick practices in their e-strategies  (and customer interactions). Thus the rationale underpinning  both incumbents’ and entrants’ strategies involves the manipu-  lation of the legitimacy criteria employed by institutional struc-  tures such as government, consumer organisations and media.12  This article is structured so as to:    discuss why research in the financial services industry can aid  our understanding of the emergence of e-commerce indus-  tries;    elaborate a basic framework of legitimacy leveraging and  building strategies for brick incumbents and click entrants,  and contrast the managerial perspectives of each on current  e-commerce evolutions in the financial services industry;    outline how brick incumbents and click entrants can use the  lever of legitimacy-providing organisations to outdo each  other, resulting in three key propositions;    enumerate the most important issues managers of brick  incumbents and click entrants should address in order to suc-  ceed in the emerging online financial services industry.

Generic click legitimacy building and brick legitimacy leveraging strategies: brick incumbents  (1) and three types of click entrants (2, 3, 4)  framework are defined as large and mature players in the tra-  ditional financial services industry, such as ABN AMRO Bank  and Prudential.  Three generic types of clicks are identified:    Complementary clicks are existing players in industries exter-  nal to financial services who form partnerships, alliances or  joint ventures with incumbents. Examples of this type of  entrant include the Dutch telecommunications company  KPN, which formed a joint venture with Dutch ABN AMRO  Bank, and the software companies Microsoft and Intuit, which  cooperate with incumbents like Royal Bank of Scotland to  build standardised customer interfaces.    Autonomous clicks are the autonomous external ventures of  incumbents, such as Egg (www.egg.com), the UK-based Inter-  net banking division of Prudential Banking.    Brand new entrant clicks are often the result of entrepreneur-  ial efforts originating from outside the traditional financial  services industry: for example, Dublin-based First-e  (www.first-e.com), backed by a consortium of venture capital-  ists and technology firms. First-e, now active in the UK, Spain,  Germany and France, aims to be the first Internet bank to  balance the global nature of Internet technology and the  demands of customers for local presence on a European scale,  and has taken the step of allying itself with Spanish Uno-e,  creating the Unofirst Group.  The three types of entrants described above are pure types.  Security First Network Bank (SFNB, www.sfnb.com), a US-based  Internet bank set up in 1995 by Cardinal Bancshares and  SecureWare, represents a hybrid of these three types. (SFNB—  which, like Egg, has already reached the threshold number of  one million customers14—was taken over by Royal Bank Finan-  cial Group in 1998.)  Apart from engaging in internal renewal (such as Rabobank’s  Rabobox Internet initiative15), brick incumbents (type 1 in Figure  1) have two external strategic renewal options when trying to  overcome their liability of age. They can seek synergies with play-  ers who already possess complementary click legitimacy in the  Internet marketspace by forming alliances or joint ventures (type  2). They can also establish fully autonomous outside ventures  (type 3) to build click legitimacy independently. This offers the  strategic option of recombining brick and click legitimacy in the  integrated marketplace/marketspace of the future. Brand new  entrant clicks (type 4) have a similar challenge, needing to over-  come their liability of youth by leveraging brick legitimacy to  combine with the click legitimacy they already enjoy as part of  the Internet marketspace.  Co-evolutionary perspectives  For most of their history, banks have been trustworthy parties,  with a ‘taken for granted’ legitimacy.16 As incumbent organis-  ations, they have been considered structurally legitimate, with  structures and procedures that serve as easily monitored proxies  for less visible evaluation targets such as strategies, goals and  outcomes.17 The status of big banks as ‘too big to fail’ (with, in  some cases, weak incentives to be aggressive) has resulted in the  largest banks exerting a unique influence on competition.18 As  they have grown larger, banks’ own activities have literally come  to represent more and more of their working environment,19  with their attention increasingly focused on their own enact-  ments within it. Dense social networks have been institutional-  ised in which an elite of incumbent managers, sharing a similar  dominant management logic,20 exchange and reflect to each  other the same set of beliefs.21  Managers of incumbents view their organisations and their  industry as a closed system, embedded in an environment they  largely try to control, as is testified by the recent merger and  consolidation wave amongst financial services institutions in the  US and Europe.22 As such, brick incumbents tend to forget that  they also exist as entrants in the new Internet marketspace, which  is beyond similar levels of their control. Lacking contesting  managerial cognitions,14 incumbents employ competitive organ-  isation policies towards customers, technology and legitimacy in  the same taken-for-granted fashion,3 a narrow perspective of the  environment that can lead to serious misjudgements when man-  agers are confronted with a situation of increasing environmen-  tal turbulence.23  Managers of entrants, on the contrary, tend to perceive their  organisations and the industry they are operating in as open sys-  tems, since they are not yet in a position to control changes in  the industry as incumbents think they can.24 To anticipate the  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 235  The status of big  banks as ‘too big to  fail’ has resulted in  the largest banks  exerting a unique  influence on  competition  Adaptive evolution  focused on dynamic  change-in-progress  works best when the  firm is a small part of  the total environment  Clicks vs. Bricks236  selective processes that will determine the criteria of legitimacy  in the emerging online financial services industry, new entrant  managers create partnerships across several industries and cus-  tomer types. Prudential’s outside venture Egg, for instance, tries  to overcome the association with financial services only by link-  ing its services to products such as books, food and drink, CDs  and so on. Security First Network Bank leveraged the banking  industry expertise of Cardinal Bancshares and the technical  expertise of SecureWare to not only sell Internet-only financial  services, but also to develop secure customer interface software  for incumbent banks.10  Adaptive evolution focused on dynamic change-in-progress  works best when the firm is a small part of the total environ-  ment.21 To anticipate environmental turbulence and the need  for changing partnerships, entrants build modular organisation  structures, which allow for strategic flexibility to adapt to the  demands of environmental turbulence. First-e, for instance,  leverages the ICT and security skills of Enba to develop Internet-  only financial services, but contracts out its clearing operations  to Royal Bank of Scotland plc, and outsources its online broker-  age trades to the investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.  However, entrants eager to disrupt an industry by building  revolutionary click legitimacy face the danger of falling into an  exploration trap25 by not exploiting brick legitimacy sufficiently.  While flexible Internet partnerships create a powerful means of  dynamically building click legitimacy, the exploitation of this  advantage can be endangered by not ensuring it is sufficiently  anchored in taken-for-granted brick legitimacy, as the example  of Boo.com illustrates. Just when the impressive growth of busi-  ness-to-consumer revenues in 1999 started confirming the legit-  imacy of the Internet as a retail channel (click legitimacy),  fashion and sports e-tailer Boo.com gave up the ghost.26 Internet  analysts imputed the bankruptcy of Boo.com to its one-sided  focus on wowing customers with technological web site novelties,  and its lack of a sound business plan and managerial and finan-  cial expertise.27 For one thing, Boo.com’s front-end web site was  too ‘heavy’ for customers lacking broadband access to the Inter-  net (about 95 per cent of customers). In addition, once it became  apparent that Boo.com’s back-end was not able to deliver pro-  ducts on time and suffered from inventory problems, Boo.com’s  legitimacy was increasingly evaluated in terms of bricks and mor-  tar criteria. It soon became widely accepted that the primary  reasons for Boo.com’s failure were its attempts to enter too many  markets at once and its unchecked spending. In other words,  Boo.com over-invested in building click legitimacy and disre-  garded the lever of brick legitimacy to a degree where it  became illegitimate.  Brick incumbents face the opposite danger of falling into the  pit of exploitation.28 Too much exploitation of brick legitimacy  and not enough exploration of click legitimacy can lead to a  situation where the incumbent’s capacity to evaluate, absorb and  utilise new external knowledge is threatened.29 Although being  thought too big or old to fail, and having the buffer of brick  legitimacy in the short term, in the long run the lack of dynamic  means to build click legitimacy is likely to contribute to the de-  legitimisation of such incumbents.  Buffering and bridging: levers of a dynamic  strategy  As individuals who span the boundaries of organisations, man-  agers serve two roles:30 to buffer, or protect, a firm from the  external environment, and to bridge, or link the firm with its key  stakeholders. Essentially, buffering strategies enable an organis-  ation to temporarily seal off its core rationale from environmen-  tal turbulence, allowing it to maintain certain norms of ration-  ality while developing bridging strategies.31 Bridging strategies aim  to ensure the success of the entire organisation in relation to its  environment in the longer term by bridging the gaps between  organisations and their exchange partners, competitors, regu-  lators and customers through substantial organisational adap-  tation. In the following sections we outline the need for both  clicks and bricks to develop buffering and bridging strategies in  order to secure their legitimacy in the emerging online financial  services industry.  Clicks: overcoming the liability of youth  A viable entry strategy is likely to be directed towards revolution-  ary, disruptive change of the industry environment. This is  especially true for brand new entrant clicks (type 4), but also for  autonomous clicks (type 3), as demonstrated by the start up Egg,  which offers an unprecedented customer-centric focus combined  with cut-throat interest rates on savings accounts.15 However, in  embarking on a new line of activity, particularly one with few  precedents, entrants face the daunting task of gaining legitimacy.  Demonstrated innovative superiority is necessary but not suf-  ficient; new entrants must also devote a substantial amount of  energy to so-called ‘sector building’ in the industry. This involves  generating a sense that the endeavours of entrants define a sector  that exists independently of particular incumbents32 by creating  objectivity and exteriority. Entrants need to follow a double track  of firstly integrating new activities with pre-existents to avoid  marginality and illegitimacy,12 and secondly disentangling new  activities in order to offer dynamic and genuine new competition  against the incumbents.33 (The first track refers to the establish-  ment of a buffer of brick legitimacy, while the second track  reflects the need to build click legitimacy as a bridge towards  changing stakeholder perspectives.)  The example of First-e illustrates this. Piggybacking on the  banking licence of French Banque d’Escompte, First-e aims to  become the first legitimate pan-European bank dedicated to  Internet-only financial services.34 But to make an impact as a  new and separate entity, First-e rolled out a major advertising  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 237  This involves  generating a sense  that the endeavours  of entrants define a  sector that exists  independently of  particular incumbents  alliances with  legitimate actors not  only counteract the  entrants’ inherent  liabilities of youth,  but also enhance  their economic  performance  Clicks vs. Bricks238  campaign encompassing television, radio, print and outdoor  activity a few months after it started up.35 Likewise, Prudential  Banking established its outside venture and new Internet brand  Egg to prevent its Internet activities being perceived as marginal  and to achieve a sense of exteriority arond its product offerings.  Complementary clicks (type 2) like Microsoft take an appar-  ently more closed-system perspective. Microsoft has made it clear  that it does not want to launch itself as a financial services com-  pany, but only connect its Money Central services portal  (www.moneycentral.msn.co.uk) to the services of incumbents  like Royal Bank of Scotland to provide a stronger proposition.36  These examples illustrate Oliver’s37 proposition that the affili-  ation of a new entrant to a legitimate institutional actor, or a  legitimacy-provider like the government or other regulatory  agency, has a positive effect on the entrant’s life chances, and  even on the life chances of similar entrants. Several scholars have  found that alliances with legitimate actors not only counteract  the entrants’ inherent liabilities of youth, but also enhance their  economic performance.38 In this context, the term ‘legitimate  actors’ embraces a wide field: the state (represented by contracts,  regulation, legislation), consumer unions and other public inter-  est groups, the media, and the financial community, including,  of course, incumbents; all can be seen as potentially providing  legitimacy in the emerging online financial services industry. It  is possible to distinguish between brick legitimacy providers  operating within the traditional financial services industry, and  click legitimacy providers not pertaining to the traditional fin-  ancial industry. Click legitimacy providers are, for instance other,  click companies, specific Internet media, or virtual communities.  In this article we focus only on brick- and click-legitimacy pro-  viders. In due course, as the marketplace/marketspace develops  towards fuller integration, the transfer of legitimacy from incum-  bents towards entrants and vice versa will become a genuine two-  way process, success in either field tending to transfer legitimacy  as one of the benefits of association.  The provision of both types of legitimacy can be illustrated  using the cases of First-e and Egg. First-e uses Banque d’Es-  compte as a brick legitimacy provider by leveraging its banking  licence, while also using its parent firm Enba and venture capital-  ists such as Intel as click- legitimacy providers. In addition, First-  e is investing a huge amount of money in establishing a click  brand name, with extensive media coverage in both the tra-  ditional financial services press and the computer software press  contributing to its publicity.3  The significance of Egg’s tie to the banking licence of Pruden-  tial Banking, its parent company and brick legitimacy provider,  is considerable. What is more, Egg’s launch of a web-based per-  sonal investment supermarket, in which incumbents such as Pru-  dential and Legal and General offer their products, provides it  with another way to gain brick legitimacy. Moreover, to acquire  click legitimacy, Egg has initiated a virtual community for its  customers (www.eggfreezone.com), in which ‘independent’  media sources provide ‘objective’ information about the financial  services world. To further improve the credibility of this infor-  mation, customers are encouraged to post all their grievances  and complaints on a publicly available web page. Egg’s linkages  to and discounts on a whole range of utility products offered on  the Internet further contribute to its click legitimacy.  The example of Security First Network Bank (SFNB) provides  a further illustration of the importance of brick and click legit-  imacy providers for new entrant firms. Some months after its  start up, three new banking company investors took a stake of  25 per cent in SFNB, including one (Wachovia) regarded as a  very conservative and well-run bank holding company. SFNB’s  link to Wachovia provided it with an important source of brick  legitimacy, implying that Internet banking could be seriously  considered by even conservative banks.10 SecureWare’s highly  regarded banking software—which went on to become a stan-  dard for US banks—further added to SFNB’s brick legitimacy.  In trying to adapt to and make sense of Internet evolutions,  brick legitimacy providers support to a certain extent the legi-  timisation process of new entrant organisations, even though this  could mean cannibalising their own legitimacy prematurely.  Consequently, in an effort to disrupt the brick legitimacy of  Incumbents, entrants try to build new legitimacy quickly by  using brick and click legitimacy providers.  Unencumbered by historical legacy, the entrants’ capacity for  organisational change is likely to outperform the adaptive capa-  bilities of the incumbents, and entrants can hope to negate the  ability of incumbents to control the changing rules of the indus-  try game. As a consequence, the dominant logic of incumbents  is likely to become less obvious, increasing the probability that  some incumbents will change their traditional legitimisation  endeavours. The support of incumbents that are willing to canni-  balise their traditional legitimacy in favour of a new legitimis-  ation process evidently suits entrants’ interests.  Based on the above arguments, we make the following two  propositions:    Proposition 1. By using brick legitimacy providers (parent  companies, licences, taken-for-granted brick services), first  mover entrants facilitate the emergence of an e-commerce  industry.    Proposition 2. By using a combination of brick legitimacy  providers and click legitimacy providers (Internet-only part-  nerships and services, virtual communities), entrants can pro-  gress faster in an e-commerce industry.  When evaluating different brick and click strategies, we need  to consider the types of legitimatising ties (such as banking  licences or alliances with incumbents) provided by the different  legitimacy providers (see Table 1).  Most click legitimacy providers will eventually help in creating  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 239  customers are  encouraged to post  all their grievances  and complaints on a  publicly available web  page  Clicks vs. Bricks240  Table 1.

Conversely, most brick legitimacy providers can help  entrants in gaining relatively strong brick legitimacy, but do not  provide entrants with the support of new click legitimacy.  Entrants therefore need to manage the tension between the legit-  imacy-building potential offered by click providers and the legit-  imacy-leveraging stability provided by brick providers.  The case of Security First Network Bank reveals the impor-  tance of managing this tension. SFNB’s immediate success with  its secure software made it hesitate about the direction in which  to develop: whether to become an Internet bank providing dis-  ruptive Internet-only financial services, or a software company  selling its software packages to incumbents.10 It is arguable that  SFNB’s modest successes as an Internet bank and its later take-  over by the Royal Bank Financial Group could be attributed to  its lack of focus on continued change and click legitimacy, and  its premature profit-seeking associated with brick legitimacy.  Bricks: overcoming the liability of age  One of the first and most widely adopted steps of incumbents  in the marketspace has been the comprehensive installation of  automated teller machine (ATM) networks. However, this was  not a strategically aligned step, as the CEO of Wells Fargo admits:  “over the past decades banking technology has preceded a change  in customer habits, in many cases solutions preceding demand,  like ATMs installed before widespread consumer acceptance.  And over time banking technology has actually disconnected the  customer from the bank and impaired the bank’s ability to create  customer intimacy.”39 Rayport and Sviokla1 point out that while  the ATM network continued to expand, bank customers began  responding to the ATM technology and not to the individual  bank providing it, coming to see banks as faceless providers of  commodities. Because bankers originally saw the ATM network  only as a banking automation, they did not predict how such  automation would change the entire value proposition of retail  banking.  In contrast to entrants, incumbents tend to prefer evolutionary  change, reflecting their desire to control changes in the industry  in which they are embedded. However, incumbents are often  entrants in the marketspace as well; how can they bridge environ-  mental turbulence to build click legitimacy, and at the same time  leverage their brick legitimacy? Meyer and Rowan19 argue that  often peripheral activities—such as creating a nice web site with  mostly symbolic functionality—are celebrated for external legit-  imacy purposes, and only loosely coupled to the technical core  of the business. (Such loose coupling can be particularly useful  in the case of conflicting demands due to the environment, as  induced by click entrants.) Incumbents need to establish buffer-  ing strategies to ensure maintenance of brick legitimacy towards  exchange partners, competitors, regulators and customers.  As an example of such a buffering strategy, the establishment  of Internet web sites by many incumbent banks (such as  www.abnamro.com and www.natwest.com) has substantial nor-  mative significance, but limited strategic consequences. The  Internet is still treated mainly as an additional distribution chan-  nel, instead of the driver of a comprehensive industrial change.  Some incumbent banks such as Barclays and ABN AMRO buffer  themselves by “shrugging off the threat of Internet compe-  tition”40 or discrediting the ‘marketing skills’ and ‘customer  relationships’41—in short, the click legitimacy—of new entrant  firms, while at the same time announcing huge investments in  e-commerce.42  But buffering strategies alone do not suffice. Their main value  is to buy time to enable a gradual implementation of bridging  strategies. Incumbents willing to develop effective bridging stra-  tegies should also make use of new boundary-spanning person-  nel, enabling contesting managerial cognitions to remould the  strategic logic of the organisation. Incumbents have two strategic  options here (see Figure 1). They may enter into an alliance with  a complementary click (type 2), such as a telecommunications  company. The alliance of ABN AMRO and KPN to start the  Internet portal Moneyplanet (www.moneyplanet.nl) is an  example of this option. Or they may establish autonomous sub-  units or ventures (type 3) with a mandate to question others’  taken-for-granted status.  “Where organisations seek to perceive changing audience  beliefs, the risk is not that centrifugal forces will lead boundary-  spanners to run wild, but rather that centripetal forces will lead  them to become lapdogs”.12 This seems to confirm Christen-  sen’s43 findings that the only way for a mature business to har-  ness a disruptive technology such as the Internet is to start an  autonomous business unit independent of its extant partner-  ships. The establishment by Prudential banking of its click ven-  ture Egg needs to be seen in the light of this dictum. While Egg  in the first stage will not substantially contribute to the click  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 241  bank customers  began responding to  the ATM technology  and not to the  individual bank  providing it, coming  to see banks as  faceless providers of  commodities  Clicks vs. Bricks242  legitimacy of Prudential, it still offers unprecedented learning  possibilities and potential brick-and-click synergies to its par-  ent brick.  Ideally, the scope of a click venture should not interfere with  the parent incumbents’ prime product/market combinations, so  as not to put the parent’s brick legitimacy in danger. Egg, for  instance, offers products in the UK that are not directly in com-  petition with Prudential’s main product offers. In this way,  incumbents may be able to avoid cannibalisation of their  product/market combinations. In addition, the know-how  acquired in the Internet marketspace by click ventures can facili-  tate competence-building and exploration in incumbents’ organ-  isations. For instance, Lloyds plans to launch an e-bank firstly  in Spain and only later in its main market, the UK, a strategy  that illustrates its commitment to incrementally build click com-  petences in the marketspace. Table 2 outlines the different legi-  timisation strategies of incumbents in the emerging online fin-  ancial services industry.  Summarised briefly, incumbents’ managers should try to  acquire the capacity to effectively trade off orthodox brick stra-  tegies and unorthodox click strategies. These skills enable incum-  bents to strike a balance between the buffer of leveraging brick  legitimacy and the bridge of incrementally building click legit-  imacy. In this way, incumbents’ may be able to turn increasing  contradictions between brick and click legitimacy (as induced by  new entrants) into legitimacy leveraging and building synergies.  Based on the above arguments, the following proposition is sug-  gested:    Proposition 3. By using click legitimacy providers (Internet-  only alliances or joint ventures) and autonomous click oper-  ations (new ventures, spin-offs), incumbents are more likely  to survive the competition of entrants and lead in an emerging  e-commerce industry.

Many incumbents may think that the  industry in which they are operating has become their exclusive  property. Likewise, many new entrants may think that they will  ultimately prevail for the simple reason that incumbents are too  inert to change. However, our core theme illustrates that both  sides are likely to be wrong. The arguments in this article suggest  that successful business models in the online financial services  industry will build on complementarities between taken-for-  granted brick legitimacy and revolutionary click legitimacy. Equal  cooperation between bricks and clicks, rather than mere compe-  tition, will be the key to success for both.  As the interactions between Amazon.com and Barnes and  Noble illustrate, entrants and incumbents in the emerging online  financial services industry need to take a co-evolutionary perspec-  tive of each other’s endeavours to build competitive advantage.  In the emerging online financial services industry, strategies to  trigger the cooperation of other parties to one’s own advantage  differ for the various players, and cooperation between different  players may not always be triggered directly, perhaps coming into  being indirectly through institutional pressure exerted by the  media, government, regulatory agencies, banking industry ana-  lysts, competitors and other members of the financial com-  munity.  The four types of key players in the emerging online financial  services industry are bricks (type 1), complementary clicks (type  2), autonomous clicks (type 3) and brand new entrant clicks  (type 4) (see Figure 1).  Managerial implications for bricks  The following important managerial implications for bricks  emerge from this study:  1. Apart from engaging in internal strategic renewal, incumbents  need to break away from their institutionalised ways of think-  ing by appealing to click managerial views.  2. To that end, incumbents have two external renewal options  (which are not mutually exclusive):    create partnerships—like strategic alliances or joint ven-  tures—with one or more complementary clicks; or    establish an autonomous click in the Internet marketspace,  which does not initially interfere with the prime  product/market combinations of the parent incumbent.  3. In either case, incumbents need to use legitimacy providers  in the Internet marketspace, such as the media reporting on  online financial services evolutions, to establish buffers against  immediate disruptive competition and to avoid premature de-  legitimisation or cannibalisation of their core  product/market combinations.  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 243  cooperation between  bricks and clicks,  rather than mere  competition, will be  the key to success for  both  Clicks vs. Bricks244  4. Meanwhile, incumbents need gradually to establish bridging  strategies towards the changing perspectives of customers, the  state, the media and other members of the financial com-  munity.  Managerial implications for clicks  New entrants, meanwhile, need to simultaneously establish links  to players in the traditional financial services industry—brick  legitimacy providers—and to click legitimacy providers in the  Internet marketspace to overcome the liability of youth. The  emergence of an online financial services industry is a collective  process, and relies not only on revolutionary business prop-  ositions, but also on reaching a threshold of sufficient  cooperation with other players.  Managerial implications for the following three types of  clicks include:  1. Complementary clicks (like KPN or Microsoft):    need to focus on control of the customer interface as the  most important lever for future competitive advantage in  the Internet marketspace, which is characterised by inter-  active supplier-customer processes; and    need to achieve a critical mass of partnerships with key  incumbents in the emerging online financial services indus-  try to ensure that controlling the customer interface is valu-  able enough.  2. Autonomous clicks (such as Egg):    need to operate as independently as possible of their parent  company—in this article by definition an incumbent firm—  to be able to build viable click legitimacy and a profitable  business model (this also translates into a new brand name  and a differentiated use of marketing channels); and    need, nevertheless, to coordinate their processes to some  extent with the internal strategic renewal processes of the  parent company, to achieve successful synergies in the  longer term.  3. Brand new entrant clicks (like First-e):    are most prone to develop revolutionary managerial views  in the short term, since they are not connected to incum-  bents; but    need to balance this revolutionary tendency with sufficient  cooperation with more conservative players, hence estab-  lishing ties with brick legitimacy providers, for instance by  getting a banking licence or hiring ‘brick managers’ with  sufficient insight into and relationships with the traditional  financial services industry.  These suggestions may help incumbent and new entrant man-  agers to judge the potential of their e-strategies for gaining legit-  imacy in the emerging online financial services industry. This  does not mean, however, that the final outcome of either party’s  managerial actions will be exactly as expected: whether clicks or  bricks will have the upper hand in the emerging e-commerce  industries will only be accurately explained with hindsight. In  the meantime, entrants and incumbents must be ready to learn  from each other, both to compete and cooperate to secure their  legitimacy in the emerging online financial services industry.

J. Van den Bosch Henk W. Volberda Michiel de Boer   Department of Strategic Management and Business Environment, Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus   University Rotterdam, P. 0 .  Box 1738, 3000 DR Rotterdam, The Netherlands,   j bosch @fac.fZ7k.eur.nl h.volberda @fac.fZ7k. eur.nl   Abstract   This paper advances the understanding of absorptive capacity   for assimilating new knowledge as a mediating variable of or-  ganization adaptation. Many scholars suggest a firm's absorp-  tive capacity plays a key role in the process of coevolution   (Lewin et al., this issue). So far, most publications, in following   Cohen and Levinthal(1990), have considered the level of prior   related knowledge as the determinant of absorptive capacity.   We suggest, however, that two specific organizational deter-  minants of absorptive capacity should also be considered: or-  ganization forms and combinative capabilities. We will show   how these organizational determinants influence the level of   absorptive capacity, ceteris paribus the level of prior related   knowledge. Subsequently, we will develop a framework in   which absorptive capacity is related to both micro- and macro-  coevolutionary effects. This framework offers an explanation   of how knowledge environments coevolve with the emergence   of organization forms and combinative capabilities that are suit-  able for absorbing knowledge. We will illustrate the framework   by discussing two longitudinal case studies of traditional pub-  lishing firms moving into the turbulent knowledge environment   of an emerging multimedia industrial complex.

Introduction   How do firms coevolve with their environments? Recent   publications (Cohen and Levinthal 1990, 1994, 1997;   Lane and Lubatkin 1998)suggest that absorptive capacity   is an important moderating factor for assimilating new   knowledge. It may enable and restrict the level and range   of exploration adaptations (Lewin et al., this issue). In   this paper, we develop organizational determinants of ab-  sorptive capacity. Cohen and Levinthal (1990) proposed   prior related knowledge as the determinant of absorptive   capacity. The purpose of this paper, however, is to de-  velop a more integrated framework of the coevolution of   a firm's path-dependent absorptive capacity and the   knowledge environment. Such a framework may contrib-  ute to a more general theory of firm-environment coevo-  lution that describes organizations, their populations, and   their environments as a joint outcome of managerial ac-  tions, institutional influences, and environmental phe-  nomena (Lewin and Volberda, this issue).   In developing our framework, three mutually related   research questions will be addressed. Given a firm's need   for increased absorptive capacity, due to a more demand-  ing knowledge environment, the first research question   is: "What are important organizational determinants of   absorptive capacity?" In addressing this research ques-  tion, we argue that besides prior related knowledge as a   determinant of absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal   1990), organization forms and combinative capabilities   also need to be considered. To advance our understanding   of the phenomenon of coevolution, we raise two addi-  tional research questions, namely: "How does absorptive   capacity influence the knowledge environment?" and   "How can a firm's absorptive capacity be understood as   a joint outcome of managerial actions and developments   in the knowledge environment?"   The paper is structured as follows. First, we illustrate   the importance of the absorptive capacity concept for   firms confronted with changing knowledge environments.   Based on a review of the literature, we suggest both or-  ganization forms and combinative capabilities as orga-  nizational determinants of absorptive capacity. Secondly,   we assess these organizational determinants with regard   1047-7039/99/1005/0551/$05.00   1526-5455electronic ISSN   ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE,O 1999 INFORMS   Vol. 10, No. 5, September-October 1999, pp. 551-568   FRANS A.

VOLBERDA, AND MICHIEL DE BOER Firm Absorptive CapaciQ   to their influence on the level of a firm's absorptive ca-   pacity, ceteris paribus the level of prior related knowl-   edge. Subsequently, we put the building blocks of the   framework together and discuss how it contributes to the   understanding of coevolutionary effects both within the   firm (microcoevolution) and regarding the knowledge en-   vironment (macrocoevolution). Moreover, we will illus-   trate the framework by considering two longitudinal case   studies of traditional publishing firms moving into the   turbulent knowledge environment of the emerging mul-   timedia industrial complex. The case studies show how   these firnls increased their absorptive capacity, not only   by increasing the level of prior related knowledge, but   also by deliberately changing their organization form and   combinative capabilities. In the final section, we discuss   the findings and limitations of the paper and give sug-   gestions for future research.   2.   Changing Knowledge Environments   and Knowledge Absorption   Outside sources of knowledge are critical to the innova-   tion process in general (Cohen and Levinthal 1990) and   in particular in the context of changing knowledge envi-   ronments. Hence, firms confronted with changing knowl-   edge environments should, to a large extent, aim at re-   configuring existing component knowledge. For reasons   of analytical simplicity, we distinguish three types of   component knowledge: knowledge related to products or   services, knowledge related to production processes, and   knowledge related to markets. Component knowledge   can reside within the firm itself, within a firm's traditional   knowledge environment, and within knowledge environ-   ments that have yet to be explored. Component knowl-   edge consists of both explicit and tacit knowledge   (Nonaka 1994, Boisot 1998). Reconfiguring existing   component knowledge builds on the distinction made by   Henderson and Clark (1990) between four types of in-   novations: incremental, modular, architectural, and radi-   cal innovation. Henderson and Clark (1990, p. 12) have   pointed out that "The essence of an architectural inno-   vation is the reconfiguration of an established system to   link together existing components in a new way." Recon-   figuring existing component knowledge by a firm leads,   at least to the firm involved, to a new knowledge config-   uration. This new knowledge configuration consequently   serves as a platform for producing both adapted and new   product-market combinations. This approach to organi-   zational knowledge reconfiguration closely resembles   Schumpeter's (1934) definition of innovation as a process   of combining existing stocks of productive means in new   ways. In the context of a changing knowledge environ-   ment, the opportunities to combine existing component   knowledge may be more appealing than the opportunities   to change the component knowledge itself. Rather, new   knowledge is often the product of a firm's combinative   capabilities to generate new applications from existing   knowledge components (Kogut and Zander 1992).   The challenge to create new knowledge configurations   within the firm implies that the absorption of different   types of new component knowledge becomes a key abil-   ity to master for a firm's management. Consequently, the   ability of the firm to evaluate, assimilate, and utilize out-   side knowledge for commercial ends is of crucial strategic   importance. As Grant (1996a) has argued, the primary   role of the firm is the integration and, of course, utiliza-   tion of knowledge. This ability is labeled by Cohen and   Levinthal (1990) as a firm's absorptive capacit_)t and   stems from the premise that a firm needs prior related   knowledge to absorb and use new knowledge. We assume   that knowledge integration (Grant 1996a) within the firm   is part of the absorptive capacity concept. That is, ab-   sorptive capacity comprises evaluation, acquisition, in-   tegration, and the commercial utilization of new outside   knowledge. Building on Grant's (1996a) three character-   istics of knowledge integration, we assume the content   and process of a firm's knowledge absorption can be an-   alyzed using three dimensions of knowledge absorption.   These dimensions are efficiency, scope, and flexibility.   Efficiency of knowledge absorption refers to how firms   identify, assimilate, and exploit knowledge from a cost   and economies of scale perspective. Scope of knowledge   absorption refers to the breadth of component knowledge   a firm draws upon. Flexibility of knowledge absorption   refers to the extent to which a firm can access additional,   and reconfigure existing, component knowledge. March's   (1991) distinction between exploration and elcploitation   in the development of organization knowledge can be as-   sociated with these three dimensions of knowledge ab-   sorption. We assume that the efficiency dimension of   knowledge absorption is associated with the exploitation   adaptation of a firm's knowledge configuration, as the   "essence of exploitation is the refinement and extension   of existing competencies, technologies and paradigms."   (March 1991, p. 85). Furthermore, we assume that the   scope and flexibility dimension of knowledge absorption   is associated with the exploration adaptations of a firm's   knowledge configuration.   Table 1 illustrates our arguments. In developing a co-   evolutionary framework, we will consider two opposite   types of knowledge environment. In a stable knowledge   environment, like a mature single industry, in which we   ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE NO^. 10, NO.5, September-October 1999 552   L   FRANS A. J. VAN DEN BOSCH, HENK W.

Contrary   to firms in stable knowledge environments, firms in tur-  bulent knowledge environments are likely to dedicate ef-   forts exclusively to increasing their absorptive capacity.   In such environments, a firm's knowledge absorption is   likely to be focused on exploration and therefore on the   scope and flexibility dimension of knowledge absorption.   Table 1 shows the impact these different knowledge en-   vironments are likely to have on the requirements regard-   ing the three dimensions of knowledge integration.   3.   Building Blocks of Absorptive   Capacity   Cohen and Levinthal (1989, p. 569-570) introduced the   absorptive capacity construct as follows: "the firm's abil-   ity to identify, assimilate, and exploit knowledge from   the environment," pointing out that "a stock of prior   knowledge . . . constitutes the firm's absorptive capacity."   In another paper, Cohen and Levinthal (1990, p. 128)   again considered the level of prior related knowledge as   the determinant of a firm's absorptive capacity: "We ar-   gue that the ability to evaluate and utilize outside knowl-   edge is largely a function of the level of prior related   knowledge." They pointed out, however, that it is: ". . .   useful to consider what aspects of absorptive capacity are   distinctly organizational" (Cohen and Levinthal 1990, p.   13 1, italics added). In their brief analysis devoted to this   question, a few of these aspects are mentioned. Examples   of these "internal mechanisms that influence the organi-   zation's absorptive capacity" (Cohen and Levinthal 1990,   ORGANIZATION   1999SCIENCE NO^. 10, NO. 5,  September-October   H L   p. 135) are the transfer of knowledge across and within   subunits; the structure of communication between the ex-   ternal environment and the firm, i.e. the centralization of   the interface function; a broad and active network of in-   ternal and external relationships; and cross-function in-   terfaces.   In considering these various organizational aspects or   internal mechanisms that influence a firm's absorptive ca-   pacity, it is necessary to ask which important organiza-   tional determinants of absorptive capacity may be distin-   guished. This question has been addressed in earlier   studies. For example, Pennings and Harianto (1992) an-   alyzed the adoption of video banking by large U.S. banks,   and the role played by a bank's absorptive capacity. They   concluded that cumulative experience with IT and link-   ages to other firms do matter. Lane and Lubatlun (1998,   p. 473) showed that "the ability of a firm to learn from   another firm is jointly determined by the relative char-   acteristics of the two firms," hence their emphasis on rela-   tive absorptive capacity, and that on the basis of their   empirical findings, a firm's knowledge-processing system   plays a key role in absorbing knowledge. According to   Lane and Lubatkin (1998, p. 464): "We can think of a   firm's knowledge-processing system as being analogous   to a computer's operating system . . . ." In their analysis,   two proxies for a firm's knowledge-processing system are   suggested: (1) a firm's compensation practices and (2) a   firm's organization structure. In our analysis, we will fo-   cus on the organization form as an important organiza-   tional determinant of absorptive capacity because we as-   sume that a firm's organization form is strongly related   to its knowledge-processing activities. Besides organi-   zational forms, we suggest that combinative capabilities   are an important organizational determinant of absorptive   553   FRANS A. J. VAN DEN BOSCH, HENK W. VOLBERDA, AND MICHIEL DE BOER Firm Absorptive CapaciQ   capacity (Kogut and Zander 1992). This is in line with   Cohen and Levinthal's (1994, p. 227) statement that ab-   sorptive capacity is ". . .comprised of the set of closely   related abilities" to evaluate, assimilate, and apply exter-   nal knowledge; these abilities ". . .collectively constitute   what we have termed a firm's "absorptive capacity."   Figure 1 shows the major building blocks of the pro-   posed framework. In the next two sections, we will argue   that: (1) ceteris paribus, different organization forms en-   able or restrict absorptive capacity; and (2) ceteris pari-   bus, different combinative capabilities enable or restrict   absorptive capacity. Put differently, we assume that the   level of absorptive capacity is not only determined by the   level of prior related knowledge, but also by the moder-   ating determinants of organization forms and combinative   capabilities.   Obviously, a firm's organizational form and combina-   tive capabilities may change over time. Below, we will   further explain these dynamic aspects in the context of a   coevolutionary approach. We limit ourselves here to a   few remarks about the path dependency of absorptive ca-   pacity. Regarding the path-dependent feature of absorp-   tive capacity, Cohen and Levinthal(1990, p. 136) pointed   out that ". . .absorptive capacity affects a firm's expec-   tation formation, permitting the firm to predict more ac-   curately the nature and commercial potential of techno-   logical advances." In turn, these revised expectations,   however, condition the firm's incentives to invest in ab-   sorptive capacity. A related aspect of Cohen and   Levinthal's (1990) analysis that deserves more attention   is the link between expectation formation, or a firm's as-   piration level, and the sensitivity for emerging opportu-   nities in the environment. Cohen and Levinthal (1990, p.   137) pointed out that the higher the absorptive capacity,   the more likely it will be that a firm's aspiration level or   expectation formation will be defined in terms of the op-   portunities present in its environment, independent of cur-   rent performance criteria such as profitability. They sug-   gested that firms with higher levels of absorptive capacity   will tend to be more proactive. These "prepared" firms   are better at anticipating the emergence of valuable de-   velopments (Cohen and Levinthal 1994). Firms having a   modest absorptive capacity will tend to be more reactive   regarding exploring opportunities. Several other scholars   have recognized the importance of proactive firm behav-   ior in turbulent environments. For example, Hamel and   Prahalad (1994) use the concept of "industry foresight,"   and Volberda (1998) stresses the influence of a high level   of absorptive capacity in developing industry foresight.   In this respect, an understanding of distinctive organiza-   tional determinants of absorptive capacity is important.   In the next two sections, we will assess these organiza-   tional determinants and their influence on the level of   absorptive capacity.   4.   Organization Forms and Knowledge   Absorption   A firm's current knowledge base cannot be separated   from how it is currently organized (Kogut and Zander   1992). The existing organization form influences how a   firm processes knowledge. In this respect, an organization   form is viewed here as a type of infrastructure which en-   ables the process of evaluating, assimilating, integrating,   and utilizing knowledge in a specific way. Burton and   Obel (1995) and Volberda (1998) have provided a thor-   ough analysis of various basic organization forms. As a   determinant of absorptive capacity, organization forms   are expected to have (ceteris paribus other determinants   Figure 1 Building Blocks of the Framework: Determinants of Absorptive Capacity and Expectation Formation   I I   I I   -  Organizational form Expectation> > formation   Level of   prior Absorptive  related capacityknowledge   -  Cornbinative Exploitation1   capabilities > > explorationpath   Determinants of   absorptive capocity   ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE NO^. 10, NO. 5, September-October 1999   FRANS A. J. VAN DEN BOSCH, HENK W. VOLBERDA, AND MICHIEL DE BOER Firm Absorptive Capacity   of absorptive capacity) a different potential for knowl-   edge absorption and so have a different influence on ab-   sorptive capacity. To illustrate this argument, we limit   ourselves here to three well-known basic organization   forms: the functional, divisional, and matrix forms. For a   comparable analysis regarding the impact of organiza-   tional form on knowledge integration, we refer to de Boer   et al. (1999).   The three organization forms can roughly be described   by analyzing methods of grouping activities, the number   of hierarchical levels, and by the extent to which man-   agement is divided into various functional areas, com-   monly reflected in the organization chart. A description   of the three organizational forms is given below and is   derived from Volberda (1998, p. 142-143). We compare   these basic organization forms in terms of their potential   for the efficiency, scope, and flexibility of knowledge ab-   sorption. However, a growing number of new organiza-   tion forms have been suggested (Dijksterhuis et al., this   issue). Examples are the internal network form (Miles and   Snow 1986), the N-form (Hedlund 1994), and the hyper-   text form (Nonaka 1994). Most of these new forms have   not yet been described in sufficient detail to assess each   of them regarding the three dimensions of knowledge ab-   sorption.   The functional form is based on a functional grouping   of similar activities under major functional managers, a   hierarchy of authority consisting of many hierarchical   levels with small spans of control, and a degree of func-   tionalization of management which may be limited (no   staff functions) or high (staff functions with formal au-   thority). Component knowledge is specialized according   to functional areas. The principal advantage of the func-   tional form is the efficiency it attains from economies of   scale, overheads, and skills. The scope and flexibility of   knowledge absorption of the functional form is rather lim-   ited. In stable and homogeneous environments where   there are few product-market combinations with a rela-   tively long life cycle, this form might be appropriate   (Krijnen 1979). In more unstable conditions, priority con-   flicts occur, decisions and products begin to accumulate,   communication lines get longer, and time responsiveness   to external conditions is degraded (Ansoff and   Brandenburg 1971). Consequently, we assume that the   functional form has a high potential for efficiency, but a   low potential for both scope and flexibility of knowledge   absorption.   The division form is based on grouping by product-   market combinations, a limited hierarchy of authority   consisting of few hierarchical levels with large spans of   control, and a limited functionalization of management   in the form of some central staff functions. Because of   ORGANEATIONSCIENCE NO^. 10, NO. 5, September-October 1999   the autonomy of divisions in terms of operational deci-   sions and their direct contacts with the environment, the   flexibility of knowledge absorption is higher than in the   functional form. Furthermore, the scope of knowledge ab-   sorption is limited to a single division. The reconfigura-   tion of component knowledge takes place at the divisional   level. The loose coupling among divisions facilitates di-   visional knowledge absorption but suppresses integration   and common utilization of knowledge between multiple   divisions. Therefore, a division form is most appropriate   in a dynamic environment with a large number of differ-   ent product-market combinations that have few knowl-   edge characteristics in common, and of which the life   cycle is relatively long. Hence, we assume the division   form has a low potential for both scope and efficiency,   but a high potential for flexibility of knowledge absorp-   tion.   The matrix form is based on a dual grouping of activ-   ities, a dual hierarchy of authority consisting of few hi-   erarchical levels, and a high degree of functionalization   of management tasks. The matrix is a combination of the   principle of specialized functional departments with the   principle of self-sufficient, more or less autonomous units   or divisions, in situations where a number of (temporary)   divisions or autonomous units need to be created. The   ability of each unit to seek the organization form most   appropriate to the project it is handling facilitates the flex-   ibility of knowledge absorption. The fact that available   means and persons can be allocated to various projects   enables a high scope and flexibility of knowledge ab-   sorption. On account of its high scope and flexibility of   knowledge absorption, the matrix form is deemed appro-   priate for organizations that function in environments   with many new product-market combinations that have   relatively short life cycles. The high scope and flexibility   of knowledge absorption of the matrix form is detrimental   to its efficiency. Economies of scale will be rather small   because different functions, experts, and tools will be   needed in different projects that are simultaneously exe-   cuted, which results in the fact that resources are only   partially utilized. Consequently, we assume the matrix   form has a low potential for efficiency, but a high poten-   tial for both scope and flexibility of knowledge absorp-   tion.   The assumptions regarding the potential for knowledge   absorption of the three basic organization forms, includ-   ing their influence on absorptive capacity, are summa-   rized in Table 2. We assume that both the scope and flex-   ibility dimension of knowledge absorption have a positive   influence on the level of absorptive capacity, while effi-   ciency has a negative impact. Nonetheless, the knowledge   absorption potential offered by a certain organization   555   FRANS A. J. VAN DEN BOSCH, HENK W.

Educa-   tion and training indirectly achieve what rules and pro-   cedures, as a part of systems capabilities, do directly.   They control, coordinate, and help to absorb knowledge   in the firm. On the job, professional or craft, workers ap-   pear to be acting autonomously, but in fact they are   guided by trained slulls and acquired knowledge. Re-   garding job rotation, Cohen and Levinthal(1990, p. 135)   pointed out that ". . .this practice also suggests that some   intensity of experience in each of the complementary   knowledge domains is necessary to put an effective ab-   sorptive capacity in place."   In a turbulent environment, mutual adjustment   (Mintzberg 1979) becomes the favored means of knowl-   edge coordination. This brings us to liaison devices for   regulating mutual adjustments between individuals or   units. Such liaison devices result in lateral forms of com-   munications and joint decision-malung processes that cut   across functions and lines of authority. Consequently, li-   aison devices facilitate knowledge absorption without   creating self-contained units. The effect is that the capac-   ity to process information and to coordinate knowledge   is increased (Galbraith 1973). Cohen and Levinthal   (1990) also stressed the importance of cross-function in-   terfaces such as relationships between functional areas,   personal contact across functions, and liaison roles in   each unit for raising a firm's absorptive capacity.   Finally, in situations in which delegation is a necessity,   participation in decision-making can bring about the   knowledge integration and absorption to offset the dif-   ferentiation that delegation causes (Khandwalla 1977).   Participation describes the extent to which subordinates   take part in the decision-making process of superiors.   Low levels of participation therefore result in low levels   of knowledge sharing. A high degree of participation re-   sults in a richer knowledge architecture, based on various   contributions of participants at lower levels. We assume   that coordination capabilities have a low potential for ef-   ficiency, but a high potential for both scope and flexibility   of knowledge absorption. Based on the above arguments,   we assume coordination capabilities have a positive in-   fluence on the level of absorptive capacity.   In addition to the explicit absorption of knowledge by   systems capabilities and the implicit absorption of knowl-   edge by coordination capabilities, we distinguish a third   type of combinative capabilities: socialization capabili-   ties. Socialization capabilities may influence absorptive   capacity by specifying broad, tacitly understood rules for   appropriate action under unspecified contingencies   (Camerer and Vepsalainen 1988). These capabilities refer   to the ability of the firm to produce a shared ideology that   offers members an attractive identity as well as collective   interpretations of reality. In this perspective, socialization   capabilities result from the firm's culture in terms of a   system of ideas, or "inferred ideational codes lying be-   hind the realm of observable events" (Keesing 1974,   quoted in Allaire and Firsirotu 1984, p. 197). Clearly,   socialization capabilities are path dependent. The infu-   sion of beliefs and values into an organization takes place   over time and produces a distinct identity for its partici-   pants. Socialization capabilities give rise to a social in-   tegration that goes far beyond the systems and coordi-   nation capabilities discussed above. Camerer and   Vepsalainen (1988) argue that the efficiency of knowl-   edge integration and knowledge utilization of socializa-   tion capabilities is very high but question the scope and   flexibility. Socialization capabilities can create mental   prisons that prevent people from seeing important   changes, for instance, in the market (De Leeuw and   Volberda 1996). Moreover, strong cultures usually suffer   from xenophobia (Ouchi 1981). Strong cultures resist de-   viance, slow down attempts at change, and tend to foster   inbreeding. Socialization capabilities are found in firms   with a strong identity. Here, one can find a coherent set   of beliefs, a high degree of shared values, a common lan-   guage, and a strongly agreed-upon kind of appropriate   behavior. This situation leaves little room for absorbing   outside sources of knowledge in ways that contradict   shared beliefs. This corresponds with Cohen and   Levinthal's (1990, p. 133) observation that, "If all actors   in the organization share the same specialized lan-   guage. . .they may not be able to tap into diverse external   knowledge sources." Hence, we assume socialization ca-   pabilities have a high potential for efficiency, but a low   potential for both scope and flexibility of knowledge ab-   sorption. Consequently, socialization capabilities have a   negative influence on a firm's absorptive capacity.   The assumptions regarding the impact of the different   types of combinative capabilities on the dimensions of   knowledge absorption and a firm's absorptive capacity   are summarized in Table 3. If a firm's current knowledge-   base is inadequate, it may change either its organization   form or its combinative capabilities or both. In Bartlett   and Ghoshal's (1989) biological analogy of organiza-   tional characteristics, organization forms are related to   organizational anatomy, systems and coordination capa-   bilities to organizational physiology, while socialization   capabilities are related to organizational psychology. Fo-   cusing on new organization forms without paying atten-   tion to the various combinative capabilities does not re-   sult in an increased absorptive capacity (see also the   complementarity argument in Whittington et al., this is-   sue). Organization forms are the "bones"; however, com-   binative capabilities, provide the necessary "flesh and   "blood."   ORGANIZATION 1999SCIENCE NO^. 10, NO. 5, September-October 557   FRANS A. J.

VOLBERDA, AND MICHIEL DE BOER Firm Absorptive Capacity   scope and flexibility dimension of knowledge absorption,   the interface function will become more decentralized,   and more outward-looking absorptive capacities will be   developed. This is reflected in an increasing diversity of   knowledge structures and cross-functional relations   within the firm. The influence of scope and flexibility of   knowledge absorption at the level of absorptive capacity   will be positive. Figure 1 shows that this higher level of   absorptive capacity brings about two effects. First, it will   positively influence the expectation formation or aspira-   tion level of the firm, resulting in a more proactive atti-   tude towards emerging opportunities. Secondly, the ex-   ploitationlexploration path will be changed towards more   exploration adaptation.   Coevolutionary Effects   We will now address our second and third research ques-   tions, namely how does absorptive capacity influence the   knowledge environment and how can a firm's absorptive   capacity be understood as a joint outcome of managerial   actions and developments in the knowledge environ-   ment? In elaborating the coevolutionary aspects of the   framework, we build on McKelvey (1997, p. 360) who   states that "coevolutionary effects take place at multiple   levels within the firm (microcoevolution) as well as be-   tween firms and their niche (macroevolution)." The pro-   posed framework describes important coevolutionary ef-   fects both at the level of microevolution and at the level   of macroevolution (see Figure 2). The first type of co-   evolutionary effect in the framework, the microevolu-   tionary effect, deals with the impact of absorptive capac-   ity on the level of prior related knowledge, on expectation   formation, and on the exploitation/exploration path (left   out in Figure 2) and how these, in turn, may influence   organization form and combinative capabilities as orga-   nizational determinants of absorptive capacity. The first   microevolutionary mechanism to be discussed (see arrow   1 in Figure 2) is labeled by Cohen and Levinthal (1990)   as a "cumulativeness feature" of absorptive capacity. An   increasing level of absorptive capacity leads to more read-   ily accumulating additional knowledge in subsequent pe-   riods. Furthermore, they showed how this feature gives   rise to the path-dependence phenomenon of absorptive   capacity.   The second microevolutionary mechanism in the   framework is the impact a changing level of absorptive   capacity has on a firm's expectation formation or aspi-   ration level (arrow 2), and related to that, a firm's ex-  ploitation/exploration. Although these impacts have al-   ready been discussed above and have been presented in   Figure 1, we would like to extend the analysis to the or-   ganizational determinants. In order not to make the   ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE NO^. 10, NO. 5, September-October 1999   framework too complex, Figure 2 only shows the possible   impact a firm's changing expectation formation can have   on the organization form in use. We assume that changing   expectation formation aimed at substantially increasing   explorative activities may result in deliberately changing   the organizational determinants of absorptive capacity or   even in new organization forms (arrow 3) or new com-   binative capabilities. "New" here means either new to the   firm, to the industry, or to the knowledge environments   involved. Subsequently, these changing organization   forms or combinative capabilities raise the level of the   absorptive capacity, ceteris paribus the level of prior re-   lated knowledge. This increased level of absorptive ca-   pacity raises the aspiration level and changes the exploi-   tationlexploration path again.   The second type of coevolutionary effect in the frame-   work, the macrocoevolutionary effect, deals with how a   firm's absorptive capacity influences expectation forma-   tion and the exploitation/exploration path, and how both   of these may influence and be influenced by the knowl-   edge environment (arrow 5 in Figure 2). Regarding the   impact of a firm's changing expectation formation and   changing exploitationlexploration path on the knowledge   environment, Figure 2 only depicts the influence of   changing expectation formation on the knowledge envi-   ronment (see arrow 4). As discussed above, according to   Cohen and Levinthal (1990), two opposite types of a   firm's expectation formation can be distinguished: proac-  tive in the case of higher levels of absorptive capacity and   reactive in the case of moderate levels of absorptive ca-   pacity. Proactive expectation formation may influence the   knowledge environment in several ways. For example, if   a firm with higher levels of absorptive capacity absorbs   new component knowledge (that is new to the firm and   to its competitors) outside the existing knowledge envi-   ronment of its industry, and subsequently utilizes it com-   mercially, then this firm may have changed the knowl-   edge environment of its competitors. Another example is   the case in which firms with higher levels of absorptive   capacity, as argued by Cohen and Levinthal (1990), will   define opportunities present in their environment, inde-   pendent of their current performance. Exploring these op-   portunities may create first mover advantages with a sub-   stantial impact on both competitors with modest levels of   absorptive capacity and the knowledge environment.   Knowledge environments may co-evolve with knowledge   creation and absorption at the firm level. Inspired by   McKelvey's (1997, p. 360) observation that "resource   pools coevolve with the emergence of organizational   forms suited for harvesting the resource," and assuming   that knowledge is a key strategic resource needed for   firms to survive, we suggest the following proposition   559   --   FRANS A.

Knowledge environments coevolve   with the emergence of organization forms and combina-   tive capabilities suited for absorbing the knowledge.   The framework contains a block reflecting a variety of   contextual influences, such as changing competitive dy-   namics, that are important for further elaboration on mac-   roevolutionary mechanisms (see Figure 2). Dijksterhuis   et al. (this issue) show how macrolevel management log-   ics may influence shared managerial schemas through   contextual variation at national, industry, and firm level,   and how these managerial schemas may have an impact   on new organization forms. For instance, firms applying   a classical management logic are likely to favor a func-   tional form and systems capabilities. As a consequence   this will seriously limit their absorptive capacity. National   and industry contexts may have an enabling or restricting   impact on the emergence of new organization forms.   Clearly, these contextual factors do influence the orga-   nizational determinants of absorptive capacity, and there-   fore the expectation formation processes. Similarly,   Lewin et al. (this issue) suggest that the evaluation of firm   performance in Germany, Japan, and the U.S.A. reflects   to a great extent country-specific financial performance   measures. Undoubtedly, these measures will have an im-   pact on expectation formation and the organizational de-   terminants of absorptive capacity. In this paper, however,   we leave aside these contextual influences.   In the next section, we will illustrate the framework by   discussing two longitudinal case studies with the primary   purpose of obtaining insights into how the firms' absorp-   tive capacity at the time of transformation of the industry   moderated and coevolved with the firms' strategic and   organizational adaptations. These case studies describe   how existing firms, when confronted with a turbulent   knowledge environment, increase their absorptive capac-   ity.   7. From a Stable to a Turbulent   Knowledge Environment: The Case of   Traditional Publishing Firms Moving   into the Emerging Multimedia Complex   The case of traditional publishing firms moving into the   currently emerging multimedia complex is used to illus-   trate the framework presented above. The multimedia   complex lies at the heart of an evolutionary process of   digital convergence (Yoffie 1997). Triggered by the dig-   ital revolution, technologies stemming from various in-   dustries are converging into hybrid forms. Among these   industries are telecommunications, computers, software,   ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE NO^. 10, NO.5, September-October 1999 560   FRANS A. J. VAN DEN BOSCH, HENK W. VOLBERDA, AND MICHIEL DE BOER Firm Absorptive Capacity   consumer electronics, and publishing. An early overview   of this new competitive landscape is provided by   McLaughlin and Biriny (1984). More recent contribu-   tions include Hagel and Eisenmann (1994) and Collis et   al. (1997).   Traditional publishing firms are firms whose core busi-   ness it is to commercially exploit the information content   of a predominantly folio business. These firms have built   up considerable experience in doing this. When these   firms are confronted with turbulent knowledge environ-   ments such as the emerging multimedia complex, the stra-   tegic challenge is to change their aspiration level and ex-   ploitation/exploration path and to absorb new external   knowledge to create a mixed-media portfolio. A mixed-   media portfolio is a set of existing (books, newspapers,   journals, etc.) and new media product-market combina-   tions that are related to the same information content. In   the context of our case studies, new media refer to on-   line databases, CD-ROMs and the Internet. These media   were new to the traditional publishing firms. A remark-   able characteristic of these new media types is that their   initial development took place "beyond the bounds of the   traditional publisher's strategic heartland" (Kist 1987, p.   4). Hence, traditional publishing firms provide an inter-   esting example of firms moving into a turbulent knowl-   edge environment in which existing but alien component   knowledge has merged with native component knowl-   edge.   Context of the Case Studies   We examined a number of traditional Dutch publishing   firms in the professional information market with a strong   background in folio publishing. Our investigation took   place in the middle of the change from a stable knowledge   environment, in this case a mature single industry, to a   turbulent knowledge environment, in this case an emerg-   ing industrial complex. The longitudinal case studies of   two of these firms are presented below as examples.   Within these two firms, multiple sources of evidence were   used: semistructured interviews were held with persons   at various management levels, and internal documents   and public sources were studied to create a longitudinal   picture of the process of change of the organizational de-   terminants of absorptive capacity from the early 1980s to   the middle of 1997. This period covers the transformation   of both firms from a predominantly folio business to a   hybrid business of both folio and new media. The specific   type of new knowledge configuration the firms focused   on was medium-neutral database management, which is   a prerequisite for so-called publishing on demand. Pub-   lishing on demand is the ability to deliver information to   customers exactly in the amount, format, medium, mo-   ment, etc. they desire. To this end, traditional publishing   ORGANIZATION 1999SCIENCE NO^. 10, NO. 5, September-October   firms need to reconfigure the three basic types of com-   ponent knowledge already indicated above: first, to re-  configure knowledge related to the enrichment of infor-   mation content, i.e., product or service-related component   knowledge; second, to reconfigure knowledge related to   the process of information gathering, processing, refining,   updating, storing, and distributing, i.e., production   process-related component knowledge; third, to reconfi-   gure knowledge related to the anticipation, interpretation,   understanding, and stimulation of a customer's need for   information, i.e., market-related component knowledge.   Case Study of Het Financieel Dagblad   Het Financieel Dagblad (HFD) is a publisher of mainly   Dutch financial and business information, based in Am-   sterdam. HFD has a long history in publishing, going   back as far as 1796. In 1997, HFD had about 160 em-   ployees, which makes it a relatively small player. Still,   within the market for financial and business information,   HFD holds a very strong position. Its newspaper is the   only one of its kind, and is comparable to the British   Financial Times, and the German Handelsblatt. The   newspaper has a solid subscription base. It is the leading   financial and business publication in the Netherlands. Be-   sides the newspaper, HFD is now involved in a wide   range of other information and communication activities   as well. An important element of HFD's strategy to de-   velop a mixed-media portfolio was its database, which   includes the electronic archives of a number of existing   folio products, of which the newspaper is the most im-   portant part.   HFD started exploring the opportunities for database   information in 1982. In 1996, HFD changed its organi-   zational structure to cope with the emerging multimedia   complex. This event marks the start of stage two. Table   4 depicts the transformation of HFD's component knowl-   edge, related to the three types of component knowledge   described earlier. During stages one and two, enrichment   of the information content remained the most important   objective. HFD believed information demand would tend   towards high quality content, creating an interesting niche   for providers capable of creating the required added   value. For a long time, however, the database was merely   an electronic copy of the journal with not enough added   value. The clear choice by HFD to concentrate on content   was expressed by the modest attention that was paid to   information technology, i.e., process-related component   knowledge. In the spring of 1997, HFD's IT infrastructure   was considerably improved when a fully integrated edi-   torial, research, and graphical database system was intro-   duced. Regarding the third, market-related, knowledge   component, we observed that until 1988 the advertising   561   FRANS A. J. VAN DEN BOSCH, HENK W.

HFD itself   did not actively market its newspaper and could not ab-   sorb the necessary market knowledge. Over time, HFD   discovered that the knowledge required for marketing of   new media was fundamentally different from that needed   for marketing of traditional folio products. Selling new   media products and services required new distribution   channels, such as Internet and database hosts. This called   for a strong external orientation.   In developing the database, HFD clearly created   changes to its organization form and combinative capa-   bilities. In the mature industry stage, stage one, HFD util-   ized the functional form. There was a division between   the editorial, prepress, and marketing activities. This of-   fered the appropriate structure to create the required ef-   ficiency in knowledge absorption capacity, as suggested   by our framework (see Table 2).   In early 1996, HFD decided to change its existing or-   ganizational structure, which marks the transformation   between stage one and stage two. Part of the new structure   was a new business development unit, which since then   has become responsible for electronic products such as   the database, as well as other activities, such as organiz-   ing congresses. The major benefit of the new business   development department was bundled expertise and fo-   cused attention. Because of this stronger internal position,   the new business development department also became   better equipped to deal with and absorb new knowledge   from external partners. An example of such new knowl-   edge is network software and services. This triggered   strong brand   External partnerships regarding distribution   HFD to start an external partnership with a software com-   pany in 1996. By teaming up with the software company,   HFD gained access to an unknown but highly attractive   market, and acquired knowledge of selling its database   within a network environment. The changing organiza-   tional structure resembles the innovative form, as sug-   gested by Ansoff and Brandenburg (1971), to negate   some of the disadvantages of the matrix form (Volberda   1998). The new business development unit focuses on   increasing the scope and flexibility of knowledge absorp-   tion, while the current business exploits the efficiency of   knowledge absorption.   Regarding combinative capabilities, the following   changes occurred. In stage one, HFD employed few so-   called hard mechanisms such as formal planning, budg-   eting, procedures, etc. Neither the hierarchical structure   nor the promotion policy was very stringent. The same   applied to the new business development activities, which   were fairly unstructured. Partly, this was due to the tra-   ditional routines that ruled the publishing industry in gen-   eral. There was no inclination within HFD to do things   differently. Besides, the company was so unfamiliar with   new media that they simply did not know what and how   to plan, budget, control, etc. Instead, the firm clearly   showed a strong reliance on socialization capabilities (see   Table 5) .  Because of its long history, HFD has had a long   time to develop a strong corporate culture to base its func-   tionalized operations on. This was especially the case   with the editorial staff department (journalists and edi-   tors), which was considered to form the core of the firm's   existence.   562 ORGANIZATION 1999SCIENCE NO^. 10, NO. 5 ,  September-October   FRANS A.

Increasingly, HFD is using systems   capabilities to evaluate new business development activ-   ities. Another implication of HFD's choice to bundle new   business development activities into a semi-independent   unit is the need for extensive communication and knowl-   edge exchange between the different departments. Project   management appeared to be a suitable management in-   strument in this respect. Project teams bring together peo-   ple with different functional backgrounds, which encour-   ages the integration of different knowledge components.   During stage one, however, project management was not   used, due to a lack of clear external objectives. In stage   two, and especially with regard to the exploration of new   business opportunities, HFD started using project teams   consisting of people from new business development,   marketing, and the editorial staff. Altogether, the use of   coordination capabilities in stage two was suggested by   our framework, while the use of systems capabilities was   not. Compared to stage one, HDF's absorptive capacity   significantly increased. In terms of the three determinants   of absorptive capacity suggested in Figure 1, this can be   explained as follows. HFD's current knowledge base, the   first determinant, has been expanded dramatically. As is   indicated in Table 4, all three types of component knowl-   edge have increased. Moreover, the change in organiza-   tion form from functional to innovative (the second de-   terminant) and the development of combinative   capabilities (the third determinant) positively influenced   the impact of prior related knowledge on the level of   HFD's absorptive capacity. In addition, this raised HFD's   aspiration level and enforced its passion for exploration   adaptations. It stimulated other traditional publishers to   speed up their knowledge absorption processes.   Case Study of SDU   SDU NV (SDU) is the former state publishing and print-   ing office in the Netherlands. In 1988, SDU was separated   from the government sector and was positioned as a com-   mercially independent firm (public limited company)   with about 1,100 employees. In 1998, SDU's stocks were   still entirely owned by the Dutch government. This case   study describes the transformation of SDU from a pure   folio publisher to a publisher of both folio and electronic   information products. The case description is based on   interviews (conducted from 1995-1997), and internal and   external documents. The case report on which this sum-   mary is based was approved in the middle of 1998. The   analysis was based on two important mixed-media pro-   jects related to two product-market combinations. One   deals with the creation of a CD-ROM version of the of-   ficial spelling guide for the Dutch language and the in-   corporation of this guide into the software package of an   international leading software company. This guide was   drawn up under the joint responsibility of the Dutch and   Belgian government. The second mixed-media project   deals with the creation of a CD-ROM of the official year-   book of the Dutch government. The Ministry of the In-   terior is responsible for the content of the yearbook. In   the period under investigation, 1986-1997, SDU was un-   dergoing three major transformation processes. The first   was the transformation from a governmental organization   to a commercially independent company. The second was   the change from a focus on printing activities to a focus   on publishing activities. The first two transformation pro-   cesses required, among other things, the absorption of   new component knowledge, particularly with regard to   information content and information markets (marketing   and sales skills). The third and major transformation pro-   cess was SDU's effort in coping with the increasing tur-   bulent knowledge environment resulting from the emer-   gence of the multimedia complex. This challenge   necessitated the absorption of all three types of compo-   nent knowledge (see Table 6). The event that marks the   transition from stage one to stage two is the creation of   the project group Database Publishing (DP) in 1994. Be-   low, we will briefly describe the transformation of SDU's   component knowledge as a result of changes in its or-   ganization form and the combinative capabilities that im-   proved its absorptive capacity.

Table 6 summarizes the transformation   of SDU's component knowledge. In the first period, SDU   did not own the information content of the two projects   analyzed. In that period, SDU was very vulnerable. By   adding value to the information content by introducing   specific electronic features of different media and by   strengthening learning alliances, SDU improved its com-   ponent knowledge about information content. Regarding   the second type of component knowledge, initially a lot   of information technology-related tasks were outsourced.   After establishing the project group DP in 1994, it took   some time to develop the necessary knowledge of infor-   mation technology and project management. As a result   of the fact that marketing with folio products was often   limited to the final stages of the development process, the   third type of component knowledge was even harder to   absorb. Market research was hardly being undertaken.   Marketing was the last step in a sequential process con-   trolled by publishers. The partnership with an interna-   tional leading software firm involved in word processing   appeared to be crucial. It offered the opportunity to ab-   sorb knowledge of electronic information markets.   At the start of our longitudinal research, when SDU   had only just been split off from the Dutch government,   it used the functional form-central organization along   functional lines-that it had used previously. After a two-  year restructuring process, publishing groups were cre-   ated, which were responsible for both the maintenance of   existing product-market combinations and the develop-   ment of new ones. This form can be interpreted as a di-   visional form. When folio was still the dominant medium   within SDU, it functioned very well. It provided the pub-   lishing groups with the freedom to run their own portfolio   of product-market combinations. With the introduction of   new media, however, the division form proved to be in-   appropriate. The publishing groups were not equipped   with new media products and so could not absorb appro-   priate knowledge to develop them. The responsibility for   these activities moved to the corporate staff, which later   became the project group DP. This separate group could   concentrate on absorbing the knowledge required for new   media developments, while the publishing groups could   maintain their regular portfolio. In the initial stage, DP   became responsible for the whole process of develop-   ment, production, marketing, and distribution. In addition   to DP, SDU established a separate new business devel-   opment department, which performed a central coordi-   nating role. This deliberate choice reflected SDU's am-   bition to become a mixed-media publisher.   In 1997, SDU once again amended its organization   form toward a matrix form. It decided to integrate DP and   the new business development department into its pub-   lishing activities. An important reason for this decision   was the desire to improve the integration of new business   development and database publishing knowledge within   the publishing groups. To compensate for the loss of cen-   trally organized new business development and database   publishing knowledge, SDU Publishers adapted impor-   tant elements of the matrix form. On a corporate level,   the organization form changed over time from a func-   tional form in the beginning (1986-1988), through a di-   visional form (1988-1994) and a major departure of the   divisional form (i.e., establishing the separate DP group   in 1994) toward a matrix form (1997).   With respect to the combinative capabilities, the fol-   lowing developments took place (see Table 7). During   the first stage, the use of systems capabilities such as plan-   ning, budgeting, and procedures was limited. Formal def-   inition of the various parties' roles and their contribution   to the mixed-media projects were lacking. In the first   stage, financial guidelines, i.e., stringent profitability re-   quirements, discouraged publishing groups from initi-   ating new media projects. In the second stage, however,   SDU's top management decided that the firm's overall   transformation was more important than the issue of al-   locating the costs to specific new media projects. DP   started using procedures to monitor the new media pro-   jects in their mutual coherence, preventing the publishing   groups from reinventing the wheel. At stage one, SDU   was characterized by a policy of strong decentralization   ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE NO^. 10, NO. 5, September-October 1999 564   FRANS A. J.'VAN DEN BOSCH, HENK W.

Coordination capa-   bilities across the various semi-independent publishing   groups were hardly present. At stage two, however, the   need arose for coordination both between DP and the pub-   lishing groups, and across publishing groups. SDU estab-   lished a management development program and orga-   nized training and conference sessions to accelerate the   required knowledge absorption process. Existing social-   ization capabilities were severely challenged by the three   transformation processes (see above) which SDU was un-   dergoing. The first two transformation processes were de-   manding in terms of cultural, organizational, and man-   agement adaptation. These processes created familiarity   with change and helped to overcome the traditional so-   cialization capabilities.   Compared to stage one, SDU's level of prior related   knowledge in terms of the three types of component   knowledge increased considerably. By changing its or-   ganization form from a functional to a matrix, and by   concurrently developing new systems and coordination   capabilities, SDU's absorptive capacity further increased.   Subsequently, this increased absorptive capacity posi-   tively influenced SDU's aspiration level and exploitation1   exploration path.

Discussion and Conclusion   It is difficult for firms to switch to new knowledge com-   ponents as neither the knowledge embedded in the or-   ganization form nor the combinative capabilities to sup-   port knowledge absorption are well understood. We   showed in this paper what the essential impact of orga-   nization form and combinative capabilities are on a firm's   absorptive capacity. Not only limitations in a firm's cur-   rent knowledge base, but also the rigidity of organization   forms and combinative capabilities may generate inertia   in adapting absorptive capacity.   Our framework shows how organization form and   combinative capabilities interact over time and what their   combined effect is on the level of a firm's absorptive ca-   pacity. From this framework, we derived various ways in   which firms, as a result of managerial intentionality, can   change their form as well as their combinative capabilities   in order to increase their absorptive capacity. Nonethe-   less, our empirical analysis of two publishing firms re-   vealed interesting issues not included in our framework.   First, the use of systems capabilities by both firms in a   turbulent knowledge environment did not seem to slow   down the knowledge absorption process. On the contrary,   in our analysis of HFD and SDU, the use of systems ca-   pabilities indirectly enabled the required acquisition, in-   tegration, and utilization of product, production process,   and market knowledge. The benefit of using clear and   strict directions for knowledge absorption is that it can   facilitate the process of breaking down existing sociali-   zation capabilities. This raises a question regarding the   speed of changing a firm's combinative capabilities. Both   cases show that getting rid of existing socialization ca-   pabilities took a long time. Due to the three transforma-   tion processes which SDU was undergoing, the disman-   tling of existing socialization capabilities was   accelerated.   Moreover, the stickiness of HFD's as well as SDU's   old socialization capabilities closely matched customer   expectations. The customers were still far from ready to   absorb new media product-market combinations. This ob-   servation illustrates an interesting interaction between   firms and their customers in which the aspiration level of   the firm may be negatively influenced by those of the   customers. This dynamic interaction of decreasing ab-   sorptive capacity, also discussed by Levinthal and March   (1993) as learning myopia and by Christensen (1997) as   the innovator's dilemma, is a result of firms listening to   their customers, and investing aggressively in   565   FRANS A. J. VAN DEN BOSCH, HENK W. VOLBERDA, AND MICHIEL DE BOER Firm Absorptive CapaciQ   technologies that will provide their customers more prod-   ucts ". . . along the dimensions of performance that main-   stream customers in major markets have historically val-   ued" (Christensen (1997, p. xii). Christensen (1997) also   points out that in the case of disruptive technologies ". . .   it is right not to listen to customers, right to invest in   developing lower-performance products that promise   lower margins, and right to aggressively pursue small,   rather than substantial, markets." We expect that a pre-   requisite for.such a strategy is a high level of absorptive   capacity. As argued above, the higher the absorptive ca-   pacity, the more likely a firm's expectation formation will   be defined in terms of the opportunities present in its en-   vironment, independent of current performance criteria,   such as profitability.   Another interesting aspect of the framework is the na-   ture of the feedback loops. As Baum and Singh (1994, p.   380) point out: "The goal of coevolutionary inquiry is   understanding how the structure of direct interactions and   feedback within organization-environment systems give   rise to their dynamic behavior." The proposed framework   contains examples of such feedback loops that can be   compared to earlier contributions in the literature. Ac-   cording to Cohen and Levinthal (1990), the relationship   between absorptive capacity and the level of prior related   knowledge (arrow 1 in Figure 2) is a positive feedback   loop: an increase in absorptive capacity causes a change   in prior related knowledge in such a way that, ceteris   paribus, the absorptive capacity increases. The frame-   work suggests, however, that the influence (in terms of   size and speed) of this feedback loop will depend on the   combined effect (positive, neutral, or negative) of both a   firm's organization form and combinative capabilities as   well. This observation has at least two implications. First,   when defining the feedback level of a loop as "the number   of variables in the feedback loop" (Baum and Singh 1994,   p. 387), the feedback level between absorptive capacity   and prior related knowledge clearly is more than one.   Second, a negative feedback loop may occur in the rela-   tionship between absorptive capacity and prior related   knowledge. This is in line with Levinthal's (1994) notion   of a competency trap, created by the fact that firms may   be blindsided by new developments in the field because   they focus on their prior related knowledge.   Furthermore, a distinction can be made between inter-   nal and external knowledge absorption. In the literature   regarding absorptive capacity, two attributes of this con-   cept are usually taken for granted. Namely, that absorp-   tive capacity is a jirm-level construct, and that the ab-   sorption relates to external knowledge. By shifting the   unit of analysis to the learning dyad, Lane and Lubatkin   (1998) explored the usefulness of the absorptive capacity   5 66   construct in an interorganizational context. In addition,   we suggest that it may be interesting to explore absorptive   capacity in an intraorganizational context, that is, to dis-   cern the absorptive capacity of different organization   parts within a firm. For example, in a firm with a division   structure, it is possible that the absorptive capacity of a   division regarding division-specific, external knowledge   might be high. However, due to the lack of cross-  divisional combinative capabilities, the resulting absorp-   tive capacity at firm-level might be lower. Externally ac-   quired knowledge has to be shared internally. The   acquisition of new external knowledge by one division   can subsequently be considered as new internal knowl-   edge for the other divisions. As discussed above, the loose   coupling among divisions suppresses integration and   common utilization of knowledge between divisions. The   use of cross-divisional coordination capabilities could en-   hance the sharing and integration of internal knowledge.   Similar to our framework, in future research different or-   ganization forms and combinative capabilities can be as-   sessed regarding their impact on the capacity to absorb   new internal knowledge. We speculate that internal net-   work forms of organizing might have a strong positive   impact on the capacity to absorb internal knowledge. This   speculation is based on the characteristics of knowledge   flows in internal networks (Hedlund 1994, van Wijk and   Van den Bosch 1998).   From a strategy perspective, at least two challenges for   future research deserve attention. First, it would be inter-   esting to analyze to what extent jirst mover jirms in tur-   bulent knowledge environments have a different process   of adapting their organizational determinants of absorp-   tive capacity compared to their followers. For instance,   do first mover firms use complementarities (Whittington   et al., this issue) between organization form and their   combinative capabilities to a greater extent compared to   their followers? Second, there is the strategic question:   besides increasing absorptive capacity, are other strate-   gies to increase the absorption of new external knowledge   in certain circumstances viable as well? For example, fu-   ture research could extend our framework by adding in-  terorganizational forms to the organization forms build-   ing block and could investigate how strategic alliances   may influence the knowledge absorption process (Inkpen   and Dinur 1998, Kumar and Nti 1998, Lane and Lubatkin   1998, Lorenzoni and Lipparini 1999). Similarly, interor-   ganizational combinative capabilities may be introduced   in the framework to investigate whether alliances with an   exploitation intent tend to use systems capabilities, while   alliances with an exploration intent tend to use coordi-   nation capabilities (Koza and Lewin 1998). Moreover,   conducting longitudinal case studies in other turbulent   ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE NO^. 10, NO. 5, September-October 1999   FRANS A. J..VAN DEN BOSCH, HENK W. VOLBERDA, AND MICHIEL DE BOER Firm Absorptive Capacit)'   knowledge environments, such as the emerging financial   services complex and the industrial complex emerging   around the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries   (i.e. the "life science" industrial complex), are important   for broadening our insight as well (Lewin and Volberda,   this issue).   To conclude, the blurring of industry boundaries be-   tween, for instance, computers, consumer electronics, en-   tertainment, banking, and telecommunications has   spawned experimentation with new and varied organi-   zation forms (Yoffie 1997). We have argued that, in these   increasingly turbulent knowledge environments, firms are   likely to develop new organization forms and adequate   combinative capabilities to increase their absorptive ca-   pacity. Our empirical analysis showed some of the tran-   sitions in organization forms and combinative capabilities   that traditional firms have gone through when success-   fully operating in emerging industrial complexes. In par-   ticular, our analysis of traditional publishing firms enter-   ing the multimedia complex has highlighted the stickiness   of socialization capabilities and the need for new orga-   nization forms that facilitate the scope and flexibility of   knowledge absorption. Of course, numerous scholars (cf.   Ilinitch et al. 1996) and practitioners have convincingly   promoted new forms for dealing with the competitive   landscape. However, a framework for calibrating these   new forms with respect to their absorptive capacity has   been lacking. This paper has made a first effort to oper-   ationalize the absorptive capacity concept at firm level as   a way to calibrate the viability of organization forms in   a coevolutionary context. By suggesting two organiza-   tional determinants in this operationalization process, we   have contributed to the call to develop ". . . a richer, even   more behaviorally grounded characterization . . ." (Cohen   and Levinthal 1997, p. 1468) of the absorptive capacity   concept.

THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF EUROPEAN NATIONS   NOTESANDVIEWS _____.~~_______ ~_ _   The Competitive Advantage   of European Nations:   The Impact of National   Culture - a Missing Element   in Porter’s Analysis?   FRANS A.J. VAN DEN BOSCH, Professor of Management, Emsmm University, Rotterdam;   ARNO A. VAN PROOIJEN, Cebeco-Hadelsraad, Rotterdarrz   This article uses as its starting point Michael   Porter’s model of the national ‘diamond’ to explain   the role of the national environment in the competi-   tive position of industries and firms. The authors   believe, however, that the influence of national   culture on the competitive advantage of nations is   given too little attention in this model. In   particular, strong or weak uncertainty avoidance   behaviour in nations and their masculine/feminine   characteristics are neglected.   lacking. Porter (1990), in his book Tire Compefifiz~e Ahm-   tap of Nofiom, claims to contribute to this topic. This   topic becomes more and more important. The mere   mention of the worsening of competitive advantage of   the European Community compared with the USA and   Japan stresses this.   However, it is generally believed that one of the   strengths of the European Community is its cultural   diversity, roughly corresponding with the related   national environments of the Member States. Hofstede   states in his new book (1991) that the laboriously   developed experience while working together with   these different nations, generates a competitive   advantage over other economic superpowers. In this   connection, the growing importance of the internal EC   market has stimulated the quest for European manage-   ment (Thurley and Wirdenius, 1989). According to Van   Dijck (1990, p. 478), a key element in European manage-   The national diamond rests on the base of national   culture, and the latter is exogenous to the firm. In   a European context, managing the different   diamonds that exist itself generates competitive   advantage.   1 Introduction   Management, and especially strategic management, has   the task of matching an organisation with its environ-   ment. Hofer and Schendel (1978) rightly define strategy   as i he characteristics of the match that an organisation   achieves with its environment. However, international   business is confronted with a diversity of national   en\.ironments. Consequently, international strategic   management primarily focuses upon differences in   national environments and analyses how firms have   both to cope with and benefit from these different   national environments.   ment has to be: ‘Reading and interpreting the complex   and diversified social, cultural and political European   business environment’.   In this article, we discuss whether Porter’s framework   of explaining the competitive advantage of nations can   contribute to this quest for European management.   Here, we primarily focus on the impact of national   culture on the competitive advantage of nations. The   article is structured as follows. Firstly, we give a sketch   of Porter’s framework and pay some attention to the   criticism. Thereafter, we try to augment Porter’s frame-   Until now, a coherent and theoretically-based frame- work by assessing the implications of national culture   work for the analysis of the implications of different for the competitive advantage of nations. In the summary   national environments for strategic management is and conclusion we return to European management.   EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL Vol 10 No 2 June 1992 173   NOTES AKD WELL’S   1 Porter’s Analysis of the   Competitive Advantage of Nations   ‘orter (1990) criticises existing explanations of the inter-   iational competitive position of nations. These explana-   ions stress mainly the importance of comparative   Idvantage of nations with respect to factors of produc-   ion. However, the international mobility of these factors   s increasing and leads to ‘fleeting advantages’. More-   )ver, in the existing explanations a role for firm strategy   s missing. According to Porter, the behaviour of firms   nust become integral to a theory of national competitive   Idvantage. That is why Porter proposes as the central   question to be answered: ‘Why do firms based in parti-   ular nations achieve international success in distinct   egments and industries?’ (Porter, 1990, p. 18). This   question introduces the role of the national environment   or the competitive position of industries and firms.   ‘o answer this question, Porter proposes a framework   If analysis consisting of four determinants. With the aid   If this framework, he tries to explain the above-   nentioned role of the national environments (see   %gure 1). Factor conditions, as the first determinant, are   he nation’s position in factors of production. The nature   If home demand for the industry’s product or service   5 labelled as demand conditions, and forms the second   leterminant. The third determinant, related and support-   “g industries, deals with the presence or absence in the   lational environment of internationally-competitive   elated and supporting industries. The conditions   ,overning how companies are created, organised and   managed, as well as the nature of domestic rivalry, form   he fourth determinant. Two additional elements are   dded to this framework: chance (exogeneous influences)   nd government. Porter considers his framework as a   ynamic system of mutually reinforcing determinants   nd calls this system ‘the national diamond’.   n   igure 1 The determinants of national competitive   dvantage   It is precisely the attractiveness of this national diamond   that can explain the presence or absence of the home   base of internationally successful firms in countries. In   this connection Porter makes clear, by way of case   studies, why, for example, Germany is the home base   of international leading firms in the printing press   industry and Italy is the home base of international   leading ceramic tiie firms. Porter states that the attrac-   tiveness of the national diamond is not exogenous to   the firms. On the contrary, the firm has a stake in   upgrading the determinants. So firms must actively   improve their home base, for example by investments   in factor creation, stimulating the establishment of local   suppliers and encouraging them to compete internation-   ally. Anotherexample is influencing government policies   that enhance the national diamond.   3 Criticism of Porter’s Framework   Although far less elaborated and theoretically based   than Porter’s contribution, rival explanations of the   influence of the national environment on firms and   industries exist, e.g. the so-called SEPT model. That   model distinguishes four relevant segments of the   national environment: social, economic, political and   technological. Cultural factors such as social values are   accounted to the social segment (Fahey and Narayanan,   1986). This means that besides economic factors, cultural   factors are explicitly distinguished. Porter, on the   contrary, states that although social norms and values   are relevant, these cannot be separated from economic   factors. According to Porter: ‘Cultural factors are impor-   tant as they shape the environment facing firms; they   work through the determinants, not in isolation from   them’ (Porter, 1990, p 129). In this paragraph, we scan   the criticism of Porter’s framework by others and check   whether the explicit omission of cultural factors, such   as those noted by Thurley and Wirdenius (1991), gets   attention. Although in anumberof internationalscientific   journals reviews of Porter (1990) have been published   (e.g. Thurow, 1990), until now thorough investigations   of the strengths and weaknesses of Porter’s framework   are scarce. To this category belongs the review article   of Grant (1991). It appears that criticism does not pay   specific attention to the question of why Porter’s frame-   work does not explicitly consider the influence of   nationalculture on the competitive advantage of nations.   That is the purpose of this article here.   4 National Culture and National   Diamond   It is difficult to define culture. Multiple definitions are   developed by different disciplines interested in culture.   After an exhaustive critical review of concepts and   definitions, Kroeber and Kluckhohn (1952) developed   ohe of the most complete definitions of culture:   ‘Cldture consists of patterns, explicit and implicit, of and for   Mauiour acquired and transmitted by symbols, constitllting   I/rc distinctioe achievement of human groups, inclllnirlX their   174 EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL Vol 10 No 2 June 1992   THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF EUROPEAN NATIONS   ev!hdiment in artifact; the essential core of culture corrsists   of traditional (i.e. historically derioed and selected) ideas and   eqlecially their attached tlalues; culture systems may, on the   O~IL’ hand, be considered as products of actions, on the other   ai conditioning elements of further action. ’   Schein (1985) developed a framework which helps to   organise the information held by this definition. In his   framework he distinguishes three levels within culture:   (1) behaviour and artifacts, as language, technology and   art; (2) beliefs and values; and (3) basic assumptions as   time-orientation, relations between the group and the   enr?ronment, and relations among members of the   group. These levels are arranged according to their   visibility. Like Harris and Moran (1987), we can compare   culture to an iceberg; the tip (behaviour and artifacts)   is visible but the largest part of the iceberg, the basic   assumptions, is hidden beneath the surface.   In this article, we shall focus on national cultures.   Although there are certainly cultural differences within   n‘ltions, one can distinguish nations in ways of thinking   that most inhabitants share, and that are tobe considered   as part of their national culture (Hofstede, 1980; Laurent,   1983).   Porter’s diamond describes the national environment   in Lvhich firms are competing. While national culture   is an important part of the national environment, a   description of this national environment cannot be made   without paying any attention to national culture.   Different authors have paid attention to the role of   national culture. They focused on a broad range of   subjects within the field of management: management   style (Lindkvist, 1988), human resource management   (Schneider, 1988), motivation theory (Hofstede, 1980),   learning curves (Hayes and Allinson, 1988), technology   transfers (Kedia and Bhagat, 1988) and, for instance,   marketing strategy (Tse et al., 1988). All these authors   show that national culture has an impact, and therefore,   using Porter’s diamond, must have an influence on the   competitive advantage of nations. Porter, too, agrees   that national culture is an important factor in the   competitive advantage of nations. But, while he points   out the importance of national culture, he does not   include national culture in his descriptive framework of   the national environment.   To stress the importance of national culture to competi-   tive advantage, Porter’s diamond has to be combined   with the dimensions of national culture found by   Hot’stede (1980). After a thorough research project into   the influence of national culture within a particular   muitinational company including 50 countries, Hofstede   developed four dimensions of national culture:   1. individualism versus collectivism,   2. large or small power distance,   3. strong or weak uncertainty avoidance,   4. masculinity versus femininity.   These four dimensions help to understand the under-   lying basic assumptions (Schein, 1985) mentioned   before. By using these four dimensions, the impact of   national culture on competitive advantage can be   shocvn. Here Lve will limit ourselves to two of these   dimensions: uncertainty avoidance and masculinity   versus femininity.   The concept of uncertainty plays a major role in theories   of the business environment. The way people and   organisations cope with the uncertainty in their environ-   ment is found as an important dimension of national   culture by Hofstede in his Lvork Culture’s Consequences   (1980). It is the extent to which people in a society feel   the need to avoid ambiguous situations and the extent   to which they try to manage these situations. Describing   the determinant ‘demand conditions’, Porter stresses   the importance of the internationalisation of the home   demand. If home buyers have needs that mirror or   anticipate those in other nations, it confers a competitive   advantage on its nation’s firms. International sales by   a nation’s firms are facilitated if the nation can export   its culture, practices and regulations abroad. But to be   successful in the export market, first a nation must have   an international orientation to sell products in foreign   countries. Second, the receiving country must be recep-   tive to new products from abroad which are often   accompanied by habits, ideas and other parts of foreign   culture which are netv to them. The openness to new   ideas and beliefs is strongly negatively-related to   the extent of uncertainty avoidance (Hofstede, 1980).   The more a culture avoids uncertainty, the less they are   open to influences from outside and the less they are   willing to leave their own safe environment. Therefore,   d strong uncertainty avoidance is not a stimulant for   openness to influences from outside. This dimension of   national culture has an important impact on the   internationalisation of home demand.   In his third determinant, Porter stresses the importance   of the relations between related and supporting indus-   tries. Relations between people are known to be   influenced by national culture. Speaking in terms of   uncertainty avoidance, in countries which are to be   characterised as strong uncertainty avoiders, people   tend to stabilise the relations they form. In countries   with less need for uncertainty avoidance, relations are   much looser and hesitation to change is smaller. For   example, Hofstede found that the difference in uncer-’   tainty avoidance between Japan and Western and   Northern Europe is large. Japan is, compared to Western   and Northern Europe, a very strong uncertainty avoider.   The effect of this can be illustrated by analysing the   relations between supplier and producer in the car   industry in these parts of the world. In Japan, each part   is made by a single firm and often designed together   by supplier and car maker, Contracts last the life of a   car model, often much longer. In Europe, cooperation   is not that close. The producer develops a new car   almost without the assistance of suppliers. Suppliers   have to compete for a contract which often does not last   longer than one year. This is just one example of the   difference in relations between related and supporting   EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL Vol 10 No 2 June 1992 175   NOTES AND VIEit’S   industries in different parts of the w.orld. National   culture has an important impact on these relations.   Competition is an item of great importance to Porter.   In his description of the determinant ‘firm strategy,   structure and rivalry’, he stresses that competition must   be fierce. Real competition will create innovation and   innovation will create competitive advantage. By saying   so, Porter does not hide his origin. It is that of the United   States. The ingredients for competition are bounded by   culture. With his fourth dimension of national culture,   masculinity versus femininity, Hofstede showed that,   for instance, achievement of visible and symbolic   organisational rewards, acquisition of money, but his.0   the importance of performance and growth, are charac-   teristics of a masculine society. A feminine society is   much more service oriented, qualify of life is important,   ‘small and slow are beautiful’ (Hofstede, 1980). In a   masculine society, the ingredients for competition are   present. So culture also has its impact on the rivalry   between tirms. Hofstede found that the USA can be   characterised by masculinity. Thus, it is important to   realise that Porter and his diamond are a product of their   own culture too.   Using the dimensions of Hofstede, the influence of   national culture can be shown for every determinant of   Porter’s diamond (van Prooijen, 1991). Here, we only   gave three examples of the impact of national culture   on the determinants of competitive advantage. These   examples made clear that national cultureworks through   the determinants, and not in isolation from them. There-   fore, we will not add a fifth determinant to Porter’s   diamond. But we want to stress the importance of   national culture when explaining the differences in   international competitive advantage. National culture   is the base on which the national diamond rests. There   has not yet been thorough empirical research as to the   impact of national culture on international competitive   advantage. The findings here are derived from the litera-   ture. To strengthen the understanding of national   culture’s consequences on the competitive advantage   of nations, more research is needed.   5 The Competitive Advantage of   European Nations and European   Management   The competitive advantage of European nations can be   analysed with the aid of Porter’s framework, leading to   different national diamonds favourable for the home   base of certain industries. For firms in Europe, the   selection of the home base for each distinct business is   becoming more and more important. Porter’s framework   can be of help. As explained in section 2, the national   diamond is not exogenous to the firm. On the contrary,   firms have to upgrade their home base actively by   amplifying their home base advantages and offsetting   home-based disadvantages. National culture, the base   on which the national diamond rests, is nevertheless   exogenous to the firm.   As one of the European founding fathers of manage   ment rightly observed, an important part of the manage.   ment function (now labelled as strategic management:   deals with relating an organisation to its environmen   (Fayol, 1949), at that time primarily the national environ.   ment. Now, for firms in European nations, the Europear   environment becomes more and more important. When   strategy is formulated in a European context, it is   important to realise that the environment consists of   different national environments. There is a broad diver-   sity in Western European nations. Basic assumptions,   as defined by Schein (1985), differ within Europe. As   we have shown in this article, differences in basic   assumptions and so in national cultures do affect the   diamond developed by Porter. They have a major effect   in generating different diamonds in different countries.   Knowing that Porter’s model is a tool for analysing the   strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to a   company in a particular nation, one has to realise that   in a European context different diamonds exist. Manag-   ing these differences in formulating a European strategy   is one of the most important parts of European manage-   ment. Experience generates a competitive advantage   over other economic superpowers.   6 Summary and Conclusion   In this article, we have given both a sketch of Porter’s   framework for the analysis of the implications of   different national environments for strategic manage-   ment, and have criticised the lack of attention given to   the role of national culture in his framework. We stress   that the determinants of his framework, the so-called   national diamond, in fact rests on national culture.   European management has to cope with different   national environments based on different national   cultures. These different national environments give rise   to differences in competitive advantages between Euro-   pean countries. In this respect, European management   can benefit from Porter’s contribution and augment it   by paying attention to Europe’s diversity in national   cultures.   References   Fahey, Liam and V.K.

M. Vermeulen, Frans A. J. Van Den Bosch  and Henk W. Volberda  Abstract  Many product innovation studies have described key determinants that should lead to  successful incremental product innovation. Despite numerous studies suggesting how  incremental product innovation should be successfully undertaken, many firms still  struggle with this type of innovation. In this paper, we use an institutional perspective to  investigate why established firms in the financial services industry struggle with their  complex incremental product innovation efforts. We argue that although the impact of  micro institutional forces is often overlooked in innovation studies, these forces matter  for innovation success. Our study complements the existing innovation literature and  provides an additional explanation why incremental product innovation is highly com-  plex and suffers from several liabilities in established firms. Using qualitative data from  the Dutch financial services sector collected over the period 1997–2002, the paper illus-  trates how micro institutional forces at the business unit level affect complex incremen-  tal product innovation and how the interaction of these forces delivers their impact.  Keywords: complex incremental product innovation, neo-institutional theory, micro  institutional forces, financial services sector  Introduction  Developing new products and services on a regular basis is one of the key activ-  ities for many organizations. New products are a means to gain market share  and ensure the viability of companies. They have been referred to as the crucial  sources for competitive advantage (Tushman et al. 1997). This is also the case  for incremental product innovations. Incremental product innovations are not  radically different from the current product portfolio, but are often refinements  and extensions of existing products of a company and seem to involve, primar-  ily, exploitation-oriented activities (cf. March 1991). Incremental product inno-  vation is, therefore, a critically important competitive factor in established  industries (Banbury and Mitchell 1995) and focuses on leveraging a firm’s  existing resources and capabilities (Henderson and Clark 1990; Leonard 1998).

Nonetheless, empirical evidence sug-  gests that many firms seem to struggle with this type of innovation, which often  results in diminished company performance and lengthened development times  (Banbury and Mitchell 1995; Song and Montoya-Weiss 1998). Past research on  product innovation in both manufacturing and service industries has focused on key  determinants that lead to successful product innovation. This large body of literature  has examined the development process, what models could support the development  process and what key factors separate winners from losers (Cooper and  Kleinschmidt 1986; Cooper 1984, 1999; Cooper et al. 1994, 2002). Additionally,  important organizational issues such as working with and listening to lead users  (Von Hippel 1986; Leonard 1998); involvement and cooperation of multiple func-  tions during the development process (Moenaert and Souder 1990; Dougherty 1992);  use of flexible organizational structures and cross-functional teams (Souder 1987;  Thwaites 1992; Volberda, 1996, 1998) and a close fit between the firms’strategy and  resources (Crawford 1994) have all been cited as contributing to the success of  incremental product innovation.  Despite the value of these studies, the problems that firms are confronted with  when engaging in this type of innovation seem persistent (e.g. Adams et al. 1998;  Tidd and Bodley 2002). We do not suggest that firms never successfully develop  new products. On the contrary, there are many examples of firms that do succeed  in developing new products. Often, such projects are managed as ‘mindful devia-  tions’, exciting enough to gain support, but they do not deviate from current prac-  tices to create illegitimacy (Garud and Karnfe 2001). We suggest that  intraorganizational institutional forces have a strong impact on organizations (cf.  Elsbach 2002), which may cause some parts of the organizational system to strug-  gle more with incremental product innovation than others. Pfeffer and Sutton  (2000) argued that divisions develop their own institutional norms and rules. The  identification with such institutional norms and rules at the level of divisions or  business-units can lead to the use of distinct organizational practices. This may  imply significant differences in performance across organizational units.  In this paper, we take an institutional perspective to illustrate how intraorga-  nizational institutional forces affect the development and implementation of  incremental product innovation. We focus specifically on institutional forces at  business-unit level and demonstrate how such micro-level forces may lead to the  development of distinctive practices regarding innovative behaviour within the  same firm. We acknowledge that institutional forces at other levels (organization  or field) may also affect the development and implementation of new products,  yet these are beyond the scope of our study.  Institutional Theory  Institutional theory has developed prominently within the field of organizational  analysis and is often viewed as a break from rational-actor models (see Zucker  1991; Scott 1987). Conforming to institutional rules may even conflict with  organizational efficiency criteria (Meyer and Rowan 1977). Institutionalized  1524 Organization Studies 28(10)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   organizational behaviour is seen as being based on ideas, values, norms and  beliefs embedded in the institutional environment. Oliver (1992) speaks of a  ‘force of habit’ that alongside an organization’s history and tradition creates a cer-  tain degree of value congruence among its members. Institutions guide individual  actions in a specific direction, due to the predefined patterns of which the institu-  tion is constructed, and therefore constrain and enable individual behaviour. The  concept of legitimacy has been a focal point of study in institutional theory and  refers to the degree of cultural support that an organization receives when adher-  ing to demands and expectations from the institutional environment. Organizations  incorporating legitimated elements maximize social acceptance and increase their  capabilities for survival (Meyer and Rowan 1977). In other words, for something  to be considered legitimate it has to conform to accepted rules, procedures, expec-  tations and frames of reference at the next highest level. This means that employ-  ees’ actions should be legitimate at the firm level, whereas firms acquire their  legitimacy from the field and societal level (Holm 1995).  In line with Greenwood and Hinings (1996), this paper assumes that impor-  tant institutional drivers or inhibitors of innovation can be found within organi-  zations. Intraorganizational or micro-level institutional forces may provide  strong explanations for the continued struggle of incumbent firms with incre-  mental product innovation. Following Scott (2001), three types of institutional  forces are distinguished: regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive.  Micro Regulative Forces  Organizational structures and procedures are among the most frequently studied  institutional elements (Scott 1987). Many formal authority structures have defined  clearly specified procedures to be followed, as well as associating penalties in the  case of failure (March et al. 2000). In his case study in Canadian mining, Wicks  (2001) clearly portrayed organizational structures as ‘organizationally-imposed’  rules controlling the behaviour of employees. Elsbach (2002) argued that organi-  zational procedures dictate the behaviour of organizational members. Regulative  forces have been associated with obtaining compliance with the field in which  they are embedded and the pursuit of self-interest. North (1990) stresses the use  of rules and enforcement mechanisms enabling this compliance. When these rules  are violated, punishment is administered. Formal structures and procedures and  organizational systems therefore prohibit and enable individual behaviour. Incre-  mental innovations seem to benefit from structures and procedures that are famil-  iar to organizational members (Ettlie et al. 1984). These innovations are typically  consistent with the prevailing organizational archetypes (Greenwood and Hinings  1993), which suggests that developing and implementing them will be considered  legitimate and should not be too problematic.  Micro Normative Forces  Normative forces introduce a prescriptive, evaluative and obligatory dimension  into social life, reflecting the values (what is preferred) and norms (how things  should be done) of the social system (Scott 2001). People in specific organizational  Vermeulen et al.: Complex Incremental Product Innovation 1525   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   roles are expected to fulfil certain social obligations (March and Olsen 1989). In  the Westray mine example, Wicks (2001) showed that the underground miners ful-  filled at least two roles: organizational roles and non-work roles. In the organiza-  tional roles, certain ideas about how to act as a miner were stressed whereas, in  non-work roles, their families expected them to behave differently. Appropriate  behaviour reflects the normal way in which people do what they are supposed to  do and is based on behaviour that is expected and valued by other actors (March  and Olsen 1989: 21). These expectations are often perceived as external pressures  to which one must conform. In the financial sector, consistent performance at a  high level, and processing competency, are highly valued. Raising uncertainties or  increasing risks is not consistent with the ruling values and norms and is therefore  most likely to be avoided. However, since incremental innovation is of an evolu-  tionary nature, only a limited number of uncertainties are involved and firms are  likely to engage in such innovation.  Micro Cultural-Cognitive Forces  Cultural-cognitive forces include shared systems of meaning that arise in  processes of interaction between organizational members (Berger and Luckmann  1967; Scott 2001). Eventually, these systems are taken for granted by individ-  ual actors because humans tend to habitualize their actions. By repeating  actions, these become patterns that can be reproduced and transmitted to new  entrants (Berger and Luckmann 1967; Zucker 1987). Shared systems of mean-  ing can arise within groups, but may differ between groups within the same  organization. Dougherty (1992) empirically demonstrated that groups with dis-  tinct identities based on professional disciplines respond differently to new  product development efforts. This is largely the result of frames that individu-  als use to make sense of their environment. Information has to be consistent  with these frames or it will be repressed or ignored (Garud and Rappa 1994).  Kaplan (2003) argued that framing is a political and self-conscious process in  which meaning is negotiated between groups of individuals. This means that the  frame that appeals to one group within the organization may not appeal to  another group that has a different system of meaning.  Although Scott (2001: 51) argues that he refrains from an integrated concep-  tion of the three forces, he acknowledges that the forces can reinforce each other.  A few empirical studies demonstrated that multiple institutional forces can simul-  taneously exert pressure on organizations (Ruef and Scott 1998; Hoffman 1999;  D’Aunno et al. 2000; Wicks 2001). However, teasing apart the forces, in prac-  tice, is extremely difficult. The different forces are so interwoven with each other  that it is almost impossible to describe any without reference to the others. Still,  we will try to describe them separately. Figure 1 displays our model.  Research Context  The financial services sector in The Netherlands is an interesting research con-  text for increasing our understanding of micro institutional forces in incumbent  1526 Organization Studies 28(10)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   firms. It is a highly institutionalized sector that has been confronted with major  changes that have challenged these firms to invest in new products (cf. Volberda  et al. 2001). However, banks and insurance companies are not known for their  innovativeness and many financial companies in The Netherlands struggle with  incremental product innovation (Vermeulen 2005). A study by Volberda et al.  (2001) showed that there are only a few outliers in terms of innovation in the  financial services sector. We excluded these outliers in our sample. For most  banks and insurance companies, new products are only modifications of existing  products that build on current competencies (Avlonitis et al. 2001). This type of  innovation mainly concerns improvements in existing ‘combi-products’. Combi-  products resemble architectural innovations (Henderson and Clark 1990). The  separate component parts of these products already exist, yet either the combi-  nation is new or one of the components has changed, which creates new linkages  with other components. As such, they also resemble Garud and Nayyar’s (1994)  notion of transformative capacity, in which firms combine resources spread over  the organization. In our case, we are interested in improved versions of these  products. This means that the linkages between components remain unchanged  and the core concepts are reinforced. These improved combi-products are  labelled incremental innovations. The complexity of these innovations concerns  the reorganization of interdependent administrative procedures and the coordi-  nation of the multiple departments involved (MacMillan et al. 1985).  Research Methods  We conducted an inductive study in the period 1997–2002, using multiple qual-  itative data collection methods. In total, over 175 people were interviewed. All  those interviewed, except one, agreed on the use of a tape recorder, which was  Vermeulen et al.: Complex Incremental Product Innovation 1527  Development and  implementation of  complex incremental  product innovation  Micro institutional forces  Normative  Social obligation  Ruling values and norms  Expectations  Organizational structure  Rules and procedures  Organizational systems  Regulative  Cultural-cognitive  Shared meaning systems  Dominant identities  Framing  Figure 1.

These transcripts were sent back to the  respondents in order to give them the opportunity for factual corrections. The  final version of all transcripts and the documents based on meetings with the 12  case organizations covered more than 1,400 pages of empirical material. Table 1  provides an overview of the research phases and activities, displays the number  of companies involved, the main goals and the research instruments for the var-  ious activities.  In the first phase of the empirical research, in 1997, a panel of company experts  was formed. Representatives from 10 of the largest Dutch financial services com-  panies, i.e. firms with more than 2,500 employees, such as ABN–AMRO,  AEGON, ING and Rabobank, participated in this group. Members of the group  were actively involved in product innovation processes in their organization.  Together with the members of the panel, it was decided to study the development  of the latest generation of combi-products. The panel considered these products  as the most appropriate examples of incremental innovations.  In the second phase, an exploratory round of interviews was conducted in 39  firms, including incumbent and non-incumbent companies. These companies  were selected using criterion sampling (Miles and Huberman 1994). The sam-  pling criterion used was to focus on companies that had recently introduced an  improved combi-product. Forty-two companies were contacted by phone, of  which, eventually, 39 agreed to cooperate. The interviews focused on the  respondent’s understanding of product innovation processes and the surround-  ing forces affecting the development of new products. All the interviews fol-  lowed a common protocol: people were first asked to elaborate on product  development processes, and, subsequently, generic questions were asked to find  out more about the stages and the potential problems in these processes, and  who was involved. The questions that were asked in this round were based on  the existing NPD literature. We did not include the results from this first round  in the paper, since we have limited information on the projects. Hence, we only  used this information as a first exploration. The results from the exploratory  interviews in Phase 2 did show that especially incumbent firms (the larger and  older firms in the industry) experienced problems in complex incremental prod-  uct innovation projects. Therefore, in the final stage of data collection (see  below), we focused on the incumbents.  In Phase 3, in addition to these exploratory interviews in 39 companies, 10  interviews were conducted with IT experts in the 10 companies from the panel  group. This type of convenience sampling (Miles and Huberman 1994) saved  time and effort in gaining access to firms. The reason for conducting these inter-  views was twofold. Firstly, the data from the exploratory interviews was rather  one-sided, because only marketers or product developers were interviewed.  Secondly, the results from the exploratory interviews indicated that information  systems had a strong impact on the possibility of developing new products. This  was verified in the panel. These interviews followed a similar protocol to the  one mentioned above. Furthermore, the IT experts were asked to provide a  detailed description of the companies’ information systems.  In Phase 4, the panel group was again consulted. Not only did we want to  make sure that we believed our projects were examples of complex incremental  1528 Organization Studies 28(10)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   Vermeulen et al.: Complex Incremental Product Innovation 1529  Research  Phase  Phase 1  Phase 2  Phase 3  Phase 4  Phase 5  Research  Activity  Panel sessions  Exploratory  interviews  Interviews  with IT experts  Panel sessions  Case studies  Companies  involved  10  39  10  10  12  Goals  To get acquainted with  the sector and financial  services  To obtain preliminary  insights in product  innovation process and  forces affecting the  process  To explore IT related  forces  To discuss results of  stages 2 and 3 and select  cases  To obtain in-depth  insight of institutional  forces affecting product  innovation processes  Research Instruments  4 Panel sessions with  6–10 people  39 interviews (tape  recorder used for  transcripts)  10 interviews (tape  recorder used for  transcripts)  2 Panel sessions with  6–10 people  125 interviews  (5 CEOs, 12 BU  managers, 5 IT  managers, 12 Product  managers, 24 Project  leaders, 24 IT project  members, 45 team  members),  observations, internal  documents (tape  recorder used for  transcripts)  Table 1.

This way, we could strengthen our argument that we were really looking at com-  plex incremental projects.  In the final phase of data collection, selected business units from 12 incum-  bent companies were studied. We selected respondents from two different, but  similar, business units in each of these firms in which exemplary product devel-  opment projects were studied. These could be either successful or unsuccessful  projects (in terms of development). In our analysis, we constantly compared  these projects in order to understand why they developed differently. Since we  tried to study intraorganizational institutional forces, we needed data on both  firm level and project level. Furthermore, we wanted to make sure that the busi-  ness units we selected were highly similar in terms of their strategic situation.  We did not include, for instance, the damage insurance business units, because  these are in a different strategic situation (e.g. short time-frames of products).  The selected companies were all founded more than 75 years ago, but they dif-  fered in size (number of employees) and focus (global versus national). Our  sample is equally divided into banks and insurance companies.  Two product development projects in separate business units were selected in  each of the firms, in close consultation with a business unit manager (see Table 2).   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   Two selection criteria were used. First, the products had to be so-called improved  combi-products, meaning that besides functional departments (such as actuaries,  marketing, IT and legal affairs) more than one product department was involved  in the development process due to the multiple aspects of the product.  The second criterion was the development stage of the project. The develop-  ment process had to be either finished within the last year or had to be in  progress in order for the respondents to be able to recall the details about the  development process. Three companies were not able to present two product  development projects in distinct business units. In these firms, we chose the two  most recent incremental development efforts in one business unit and added  these to our sample. The 125 interviews were conducted with people in differ-  ent departments and at various hierarchical levels in the organization. The same  protocol mentioned was again used.  Data Analysis  The transcripts describe the experiences and opinions of the respondents regard-  ing complex incremental product innovation projects. As such, they reflect specific  characterizations of the respondents’ version of reality. These characterizations  referred to the respondent’s opinion on why certain events and activities occurred.  Several steps were taken in the analysis of the transcripts (see also Appendix).  First, we engaged in a coding procedure (cf. Miles and Huberman 1994) in which  labels were assigned to text units (sentences or paragraphs). These labels repre-  sented the key issues mentioned by the respondents. During this initial stage, we  mainly used descriptive codes for broad overview of key issues in the innovative  efforts of banks and insurance companies. These codes entail little interpretation  since they closely resemble the text of the transcripts; in our case, descriptive  codes like cooperation (COP), division of labour (DOL), sanctions (SAN), infor-  mal meetings (IME), formal meetings (FME) and coordination (COR) are exam-  ples of descriptive codes that were attributed to ‘organizational structure’.  Second, we identified underlying patterns by grouping the initial codes into a  smaller number of themes (cf. Miles and Huberman 1994), often referred to as  ‘axial coding’. These patterns were first compared across interviews. An example  of a pattern that appeared from our data is the so-called expectancy gap. While  examining our data, we discovered that the unsuccessful projects suffered from  major differences between the managerial and employee levels. CEOs and senior  managers thought incremental innovation was crucial for the viability of their com-  panies, whereas the employees considered it a burden. Passages from the tran-  scripts related to each of the patterns were highlighted. Next, we grouped passages  relating to the same patterns. We were eventually able to identify several patterns  that appeared to be dominant (we counted the appearance of all the patterns in the  interviews) in either the regulatory, normative or cultural-cognitive perspective.  Thus, we structured the data analysis process by using coding procedures,  allowing us to identify the most relevant issues in our data. We were able to con-  struct two distinct templates that were used in the firms we studied. One of these  was labelled the ‘business-as-usual’ template, and the other ‘innovation’ tem-  plate. The patterns from the axial coding stage and the further refinement into  separate themes helped us in describing the features of the two templates.  1530 Organization Studies 28(10)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   Vermeulen et al.: Complex Incremental Product Innovation 1531  D  ev  el  op  m  en  t  tim  e   in   m  on  th  s  >   2  4  >   2  4  12   ≤  24  12   ≤  24  6   ≤  12  6   ≤  12  12   ≤  24  6   ≤  12  6   ≤  12  1   ≤  6  6   ≤  12  6   ≤  12  Pr  oje  ct  U  ns  uc  ce  ss  fu  l p  ro  jec  ts  B  an  Co   1  Fi  nC  o   1  Su  re  Co   1  R  ea  lC  o   1  Pa  yC  o   1  R  isk  Co   1  Ca  sh  Co   1  Li  fe  Co   1  H  yp  Co   1  Cr  ed  itC  o   1  A  ss  ur  Co   1  Ch  ip  Co   1  Fe  at  ur  es   o  f P  ro  du  ct   In  no  v  at  io  n  Im  pr  ov  ed   c  om  bi  -p  ro  du  ct  ; n  ew   v  er  sio  n   of   a  n   ex  ist  in  g   m  or  tg  ag  e   pr  od  uc  t w  ith   e  x  ist  in  g   lin  ka  ge  s.

I always  make sure that my project leaders  follow this procedure. If not, they  have a serious problem.'   ‘I know that there are some board  members that want us to develop  more new products, but luckily  most of the people down here do  not bother too much with these  ideas. We don’t have time to work  on innovation.’  ‘There were four key departments  concerned with this product:  marketing, product management,  actuary and IT. I had the feeling  that they did not speak each  other’s language at all. This was  one of the reasons for our problems.  The activities of these departments  have, of course, hardly been  integrated into our organization.  They operated mostly in isolation.  This (cooperating with other  departments) was therefore more  less new to them.’  Successful projects  ‘We need to isolate these projects from  the rest of the organization. Otherwise  there will be too many formal rules that  we need to comply with. We first design  something really good, and then fit it in  the system, not the other way around.’  ‘Our main strength is that everybody  shares the same expectations. We all  know where we are going and why.  From the CEO to people in the  administrative departments, we know  what to expect from each other. As  long as nobody deviates from that path,  there is no problem.’  ‘If you look at who is actually in the  lead here … it’s us! We are the creative  people in this organization and we  make the rules of the innovation game.  Not the bureaucrats from IT or the  legal departments that try to block  every new idea. Although they often  succeed, it will not happen here. Our  boss does not allow that to happen. We  are in charge of these projects.’  Table 3.   Exemplary Quotes  Regarding Micro  Institutional Forces  Research Findings  This section discusses the empirical findings in line with the three types of  forces, as discussed above (regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive). We  make a distinction between the successful and unsuccessful projects. The quotes  used in the description of our research findings are exclusively related to spe-  cific projects. The quotes in Table 3, however, are used to illustrate the findings  across multiple projects and resemble exemplary quotes that are associated with  at least eight of the 12 unsuccessful or successful projects.   Micro Regulative Forces  Micro regulative forces are relatively easy to identify. These forces are highly  influential in organizations due to their ‘power to set rules, monitor activity, and  enforce compliance’ (Wicks 2001). The case studies revealed that most finan-  cial companies tried to change their formal structure.  Unsuccessful Projects  The organizations in our study demonstrated that new project-based organiza-  tional structures did not function as they were supposed to at shop-floor level.   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   Individual actions that were aimed at avoiding the old, departmentalized  structure were in some cases sanctioned. Exchanging information between  departments was experienced as being difficult and, at times, undesirable.  Formal rules and procedures dictate organizational behaviour in many busi-  ness units in the financial services sector. Although these rules are often meant  to improve the efficiency and effectiveness, they may also affect business units  negatively. This was clearly the case in the unsuccessful projects in our study.  Whereas employees in banks and insurance companies used to be appraised and  rewarded for the number of policies processed, in the new structures this had  not changed. Especially for smaller projects, this has had its effects. Team  members often hardly work on these projects, because they fear that they will  be sanctioned if the department’s targets are not reached. The functional heads  of departments were, therefore, unwilling to free some of their employees to  work on new product development projects. As a result, incremental projects  sometimes take up to 24 months to be completed (see also Table 2).  ‘Our organizational structure is set up to support innovation. However, this only applies  to big projects. When smaller projects are involved, the misery begins. Team members  hardly work on these projects, because they will be sanctioned if they do not reach the  targets for the department they normally work for. So, the functional team leaders are not  really interested in letting people go to work on new product development and start  harassing my project members about targets that should be reached. How are you sup-  posed to run a project when this is constantly slowing the development process down?’  (BanCo project leader).  This clinging to formal rules and procedures had a strong inhibitive impact on  the product development activities. In seven of the business units, we were able  to identify some kind of sanction mechanism used to keep in line with the stan-  dard procedures.  The existing information systems are also an important regulative force, which  set hard boundaries for new products yet to be developed. Product developers in  all 12 failed projects complained that the IT department often argued that, when  some new product was being developed, the adaptations needed in the system  were not possible. This necessitated adjustments in the product concept. In all 12  cases, this meant that the product concept was less innovative than was originally  intended, and, as such, the information systems inhibited the development of  new products. A complicating factor is that it is not possible for people outside  the IT department to judge whether adjustments to the systems are possible. It  was frequently mentioned that IT personnel were not really interested in product  development and often claimed that something was not possible. Most new prod-  ucts are still IT-driven, or at least guided by the state of IT. Most of the time, the  product concept would be adjusted in line with IT possibilities, because it was  considered impossible to change the information systems.  Successful Projects  One of the key features of the successful projects is their separation from the  regular organization, not leaving room for ‘outside’ interference. The bureau-  cratic influences from the organization were successfully kept away from these  projects, meaning that the team members could concentrate on their project  1534 Organization Studies 28(10)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   tasks without being bothered with routine day-to-day activities. Several respondents  claimed that the only way to avoid the excessive rules and procedures in their  organizations was to isolate their projects. In these situations, separate struc-  tures were designed to shelter the new product from the standing organization.  Furthermore, in the successful projects, the team members were reluctant to use  formal rules and procedures.  ‘When I was transferred to the BU Pensions, I was immediately asked to forget all the  procedures used in the rest of the organization. I knew this was a rather strange bunch of  cowboys, but in the first development project I was involved in, I immediately under-  stood what they were doing and why they were doing it. These guys almost made me  swear not to look into any manual. They claimed that that would restrict our creative  capabilities.’ (PayCo Marketing Manager).  Key to all the successful projects in our study was the idea of ‘letting go’.  Several business unit managers claimed that every innovation project required  a slightly different approach. They stressed, however, the importance of cre-  ativity and freedom to manoeuvre as the key to success.  Micro Normative Forces  Normative aspects of institutions are often found in notions of appropriate  behaviour (March and Olson 1989). The emphasis of normative forces is on ‘pre-  scriptive, evaluative and obligatory dimensions’ of social life (Scott 2001: 54).  Unsuccessful Projects  The business unit managers in our study closely monitored the activities at the  initiation stage, not allowing for much creativity. There is a clear attitude of risk  avoidance displayed in the business units we studied. Many of our respondents  claimed that managers constantly think they should reduce any risk involved  with innovative projects. This kind of risk-avoiding behaviour is reflected in  much of the innovative activities of the firms in our study, and is closely related  to the formal rules and procedures. In the product development manuals, for  instance, the type of initial scans needed before a decision is taken to actually  develop a new product are clearly described. The actual amount of pages related  to these initial stages, before a go/no-go, is often twice the number of pages  spent on the execution and implementation. Besides that, the formal rules and  procedures (including the manuals) are often used as straightjackets that inhibit  innovative behaviour and lead to expectations of appropriate behaviour. This  was explained by a HypCo product manager:  ‘Cooperating with other team members was really difficult. The tasks were strictly  divided and no one seemed to be interested in each other’s task. I tried to get some of the  other members more involved with my tasks, but they just rejected any attempt at closer  cooperation. I just didn’t understand why this was the case, but some of the colleagues  in my department told me that it was just not done to have these informal talks in this  organization. The project’s weekly meeting was the place to discuss these things.’  The results from our case studies also showed that there is a gap between the  expectations from management, regarding the necessity of incremental product  Vermeulen et al.: Complex Incremental Product Innovation 1535   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   innovation, and the perception of these expectations of the employees. This  frequently meant that employees did not understand that innovation was highly  valued, or at least claimed to be highly valued, by top management. Business  unit managers and shop-floor employees were not only hardly interested in new  products, but also did not see these activities to be very relevant for their orga-  nization. Furthermore, they were sometimes sanctioned for not reaching opera-  tional targets (for instance, in terms of policies processed) and as a result did  not value innovation.  This is closely related to the lack of (social) obligation to incremental prod-  uct innovation. The project leaders particularly experienced this. They claimed  that many projects are completed in a very different team composition com-  pared to the ‘starting line-up’. Apparently, somewhere during the development  process, priorities shift to projects related to the daily activities, and team  members are reallocated by their superiors, who feel no obligation to finish pro-  jects that team members were originally assigned to. Due to the high frequency  with which this happens, the project leaders feel as if their projects are of little  relevance. There was hardly any obligation from team members to finish their  project activities. Their team leaders often did not expect them to spend too  much time on product development.  Successful Projects  In the business units with successful projects, we identified a different set of  normative forces — in particular, ruling norms and values related to risk and  mutual expectations, clearly directed at enabling incremental innovation. What  was most striking in the interviews with respondents from these BUs was the  absence of ‘risk’ in their stories. Only when asked, did they talk about potential  risks of innovation. They merely considered risk to be an essential part of every  innovation project, incremental or radical, but did not bother too much with  avoiding it. One BU manager from CreditCo claimed:  ‘We borrowed Nike’s slogan; Just do it. This is how it works. If you start wondering or  recalculating everything too long there will be no new products launched or you launch  them too late. This is even worse than an occasional failure. I know we are about the only  ones in this company who do it like this, but it really works for us. And as long as they  [top management] let us, why should I start worrying about possible problems. We do  our homework, but do not drown in it.’  This quote illustrates the main differences in the perception and way of han-  dling risk between successful and unsuccessful projects. Whereas the unsuc-  cessful projects spend the majority of their time on avoiding any potential risk,  the successful projects are much faster on deciding whether or not to develop  the new product. As a result, the development times were much shorter in these  latter projects. Remarkably, this way of thinking is reinforced by the way these  BUs deal with formal rules and procedures. In the previous section, it was  explained that ‘letting go’ was considered essential for innovation. The idea of  ‘just do it’ seems to be closely related to the rejection of using development  manuals and other organizational procedures.  The expectancy gap between top management and business unit, as it appeared  in the unsuccessful projects, did not appear in the successful projects. The  1536 Organization Studies 28(10)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   expectations from top management were aligned with the actual behaviour in  the successful projects. Again, this speeded up the development process and led  to less iteration. Most of the team members were fully devoted to the innovative  projects they were working on, and some considered it to be an honour. The  alignment of expectations has been a key success factor in these business units.  Micro Cultural-Cognitive Forces  The cultural-cognitive emphasis of institutions resembles ‘shared conceptions  that constitute the nature of social reality and the frames through which meaning  is made’ (Scott 2001: 57). In this study, micro cultural-cognitive forces are shared  conceptions and frames of reference belonging to distinct professional identities.  Furthermore, we discovered that the successful projects were framed (cf. Kaplan  2003) differently when compared with their less successful counterparts.  Unsuccessful Projects  The various professional disciplines involved in innovation processes have  developed different systems of meaning over time. The departments, in the case  companies, seemed to have their own way of working (accompanied by specific  jargon or language and even dress codes), and their own vision of the path their  business unit and organization should follow. The specialists from different dis-  ciplines did not speak the same language, and created little understanding for  each other’s activities. Project team members represented their functional  department. This led to difficulties in creating a common understanding of the  aims, properties and process-requirements of incremental innovations. It often  involved aspects such as different languages and visions, resulting in lower lev-  els of cooperation in the project teams. Most of these problems manifested  themselves on the interface between marketing and information technology  departments and (in case of insurance products) between actuaries and the other  team members. This kind of behaviour has developed over the years and is an  illustration of the existence of distinct systems of shared meanings. Eventually,  the most dominant disciplines decided what happened. In the unsuccessful pro-  jects, these were often actors from the actuarial, legal and IT departments.  These departments had a limited interest in exploring new opportunities, and  instead focused on exploiting the companies’ existing practices.  ‘Basically what happens is that we come up with an interesting new idea. Management  initially approves of the idea and commits to the project. However, typically, when the  idea is further described in a product concept, all sorts of adjustments need to be made  because the idea is too far-fetched and does not fit our current systems or whatever. It  happens with almost every improved combi-product. There are too many powerful  people in certain parts of this organization that are just not fond of all these new ideas.  In the end, they decide what happens.’ (BanCo product manager)  Successful Projects  The successful projects in our sample show that different meaning systems do not  necessarily have to lead to conflict situations. In four of the successful projects,  project leaders focused on team building and creating a shared understanding,  Vermeulen et al.: Complex Incremental Product Innovation 1537   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   before the team actually started working on the project. A special kick-off session  was organized in which the team members quickly discovered that they could  cooperate together despite their differences. These projects were given the oppor-  tunity (in terms of funding and top management support) to actually invest in  team building. Instead of these project teams being dominated by different iden-  tities, they converged into groups with a shared identity.  ‘What we actually do is more or less pretend that these projects are major breakthrough  innovations. We set up the entire organization, as if it was a radical project. We separate it  from the regular organization, away from all the rules and procedures, because otherwise  our daily operations will interfere. We have people who are almost fully dedicated (in time)  to the project and they all work in the same room. Only if we set it up like this, the rest of  the organization realizes that this is important for the entire organization, which creates a  better position for the project when it needs to be implemented.’ (SureCo BU manager)  In eight of the successful projects, we were able to identify similar attempts of  ‘framing’ incremental innovation projects as radical innovation projects.1 For  many business units this seemed to be the most effective way of managing  incremental projects. Some of the BU managers claimed that increasing the  importance of their projects for the whole organization gave them a better bar-  gaining position for resources. This very much relates to the notion of framing  contests (Kaplan 2003), in which negotiation is a political game to be played  with powerful players. Framing projects, more radically, provides a jump-start  in these negotiations.  Discussion  The innovation literature emphasizes that incremental innovations do not differ  much from existing product portfolios and, therefore, routine procedures and  capabilities are sufficient to initiate this type of innovation. However, many  incumbent firms still struggle with incremental product innovation efforts  despite the numerous studies suggesting solutions to overcome potential barri-  ers. Occasionally, they are capable of successfully developing incremental inno-  vations, which means that the innovation is developed and launched onto the  market rapidly and smoothly. The main reason for this variation in success does  not only come from better organizing projects or more sophisticated use of the  available tools to develop new products, as has often been suggested by the new  product development literature (e.g. Cooper 1999; Kahn 2004). We have argued  that intraorganizational institutional forces have a strong impact on the innov-  ative efforts of incumbent firms (cf. Elsbach 2002).  In our study of the development and implementation of complex incremental  product innovation projects, we have provided evidence that micro  institutional  forces impact strongly on these projects. Their persistence over time is largely  due to the fact that they have become institutionalized and have led to the devel-  opment of distinct organizational templates (cf. Greenwood and Hinings 1993).  As such, we believe that an institutional perspective has the potential to comple-  ment the existing innovation literature in uncovering some of the underlying rea-  sons for the (lack of) innovative behaviour of certain parts of an organization.  1538 Organization Studies 28(10)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   The regulatory forces, for instance, primarily deal with facilitating or obstruct-  ing exchanges among members of an organization (cf. Zucker 1988). This not  only refers to the organizational rules and standard operating procedures, but also  to the IT systems. For any innovation project in which multiple departments are  involved facilitating exchanges between representatives from these departments is  crucial. However, internal structures exhibit ‘the social permanence of institu-  tions’. When the degree of internal institutionalization in incumbent firms  increases over time, similarity with other organizations, including the degree of  codification and interdependence, will make it for incumbent firms more difficult  to change these structures (Zucker 1988:35). The unsuccessful projects in our  study clearly suffered from these regulatory institutional forces. In the successful  projects, we also were able to identify some kind of regulatory forces. These were,  however, very much directed towards enhancing creativity. The rules that guide  the actions of individuals in these projects were mostly informal and were clearly  communicated, and deviations were hardly accepted.  The micro normative forces in our study also affected incremental innovation.  Managers in the unsuccessful projects displayed a strong risk-avoiding attitude on  the one hand, whereas on the other hand they hardly felt any obligation to com-  plete projects on time. The internalization of this kind of behaviour generates  expectations that guide the actions of other organizational members (Scott 2001).  In our case, this meant that not only managers, but also team members lacked  social obligation. Furthermore, there were clear distinctions regarding the percep-  tions on the need for incremental innovation between various actors in the organi-  zations studied; different perceptions of top managers, business unit managers and  lower-level managers, and employees directly involved in executing incremental  product innovation projects, in particular, contributed negatively to the success of  these projects. The unsuccessful projects in our study seem to be lacking institu-  tional concurrence (Dougherty and Cohen 1995), which indicates that there is no  alignment between what top management is thinking and doing and what employ-  ees are thinking and doing. In the business units that successfully managed to  develop incremental innovations, we found a different institutional logic (cf. Friedland  and Alford 1991). Not only were the expectations clear and consistent in various  layers of the organization, the perception of risk was quite different. Risk was val-  ued as being ‘part of the game’ and could not be reduced completely.  Cultural-cognitive forces include different systems of meaning and dominant  identities. When powerful actors in the organizations were opposed to innovation  (cf. Greenwood and Hinings 1996), hardly any resources were made available. The  shared systems of meaning are negotiated over time in interaction processes  between organizational actors (Scott 2001). The more time individuals spend inter-  acting with identity-like individuals, the stronger the degree of segmentation in an  organization (cf. Trice 1993). Again, we found strong differences between the suc-  cessful and unsuccessful cases. The successful projects were almost all framed as  radical projects in order to obtain and maintain the necessary resources and to be  able to escape from the rules and procedures of the standing organization.  Two distinct templates were found in the firms in our study. Although there  were differences between the templates used in these firms, the templates shared  many attributes. Here we focus only on the commonalities. The unsuccessful  Vermeulen et al.: Complex Incremental Product Innovation 1539   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   projects were all dominated by a ‘business as usual’ template. The projects were  all managed by a strict adherence to prevailing rules and procedures, risk avoid-  ance was highly valued, and the dominant powerful departments clearly sup-  ported this way of dealing with incremental innovation projects, which were taken  for granted. The successful projects displayed an ‘innovation’ template in which  the rules and standard procedures were discarded, projects were isolated from the  organization, risks were valued as being part of the innovation game, and projects  were framed in line with more breakthrough innovations. Our ‘innovation’ tem-  plate deviates from many studies that suggest that new ideas must be framed in  line with the status quo, disguising their radical nature, in order to obtain legiti-  macy (e.g. Aldrich and Fiol 1994; Hargadon and Douglas 2001). Although the  true nature of these innovative attempts can be labelled ‘mindful deviations’  (Garud and Karnøe 2001), they were framed in a more deviant way. However, as  Garud and Karnøe (2001) argued, this degree of deviance should not be too large  for this will generate illegitimacy. It is not likely that all projects within a firm can  be managed as breakthrough innovations; most firms will lack the resources to do  so. The concept of mindful deviations is, however, an intriguing concept that may  allow firms to be more successful with incremental innovations.  It was mentioned earlier that a few empirical studies demonstrated that multi-  ple institutional forces can simultaneously exert pressures on organizations  (Ruef and Scott 1998; Hoffman 1999; D’Aunno et al. 2000; Scott et al. 2000;  Wicks 2001). Although we tried to describe the forces separately from each  other, the forces are clearly interwoven. The interaction between micro institu-  tional forces further enforces their impact on the two templates we identified.  Our data also provided empirical evidence for the existence of interactions  between various forces that reinforced their impact. The regulatory forces in our  study clearly interacted with normative forces. The rules and procedures that  drive organizational behaviour seem to interact with the perceived expectations  of employees regarding the core activities of their organizations. If employees  are sanctioned for not reaching set targets (e.g. number of policies processed),  while simultaneously not being rewarded for efforts in new product development  projects, they may experience a lack of legitimacy for incremental product inno-  vation. This way of working becomes normatively valued, over time, and then  taken for granted. Furthermore, the business units that embraced incremental  innovation created an atmosphere of ‘letting go’ of the formal rules and proce-  dures, which simultaneously led to a ‘just do it’ mentality. The prevailing idea in  these units was that incremental innovation always carries a certain amount of  risk, but that that should not stop or delay the development process. The latter  normative force (risk avoidance) closely interacted with the meaning systems of  different professional disciplines (micro cultural-cognitive), which in turn inter-  acted with the regulatory forces. A final example of interaction was the framing  of incremental projects as if they were ‘radical’ projects. These projects were  separated from the regular organization, and managed to escape the formal rules  and procedures. The institutional logic in the business units that framed their pro-  jects in more ‘radical’ terms clearly differed from the more traditional business  units in our study. Thus, in this research context, we found indications that  micro-institutional forces do not compete with each other, but instead are com-  plementary and reinforce each other in favour of either of the two templates.  1540 Organization Studies 28(10)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   Limitations, Future Research and Conclusion  As with most studies, our study also has limitations. We only studied one spe-  cific sector, the financial services sector, in one country. Additionally, there may  be differences between countries regarding the macro institutional forces, and  their impact on micro institutional forces, that may affect the outcomes of our  study. Finally, we studied a specific type of innovation: incremental product  innovation. Radical innovations may follow a completely different trajectory  and may be more legitimate, so the impact of micro institutional forces may be  limited. More research on these issues is needed.  These limitations suggest at least two directions for future research. First,  empirical research is needed in both other industries, and in the financial ser-  vices sector of other (EU) countries (Flier et al. 2003), to investigate the value  of our framework. It has been argued in the innovation literature that innovation  differs across industries and countries. The financial services industry is highly  regulated, which makes it extremely interesting to study other highly regulated  industries such as utilities, public schooling systems, childcare and airlines. In  some countries, innovation may in itself prove to be more legitimate as the  national government provides an environment that is conducive to innovation  (Afuah 1998).  Second, the findings also suggest that special attention is needed for the inter-  action dynamics between regulatory, normative and cultural-cognitive forces.  As was argued earlier, institutional research has not often focused on this inter-  action. Further research is needed to uncover the dynamics of interaction to  fully understand (a) which institutional forces interact, (b) how exactly these  forces interact and (c) how the interaction of forces affects the legitimacy of  innovation.  In this paper, we set out to investigate the determinants of successful incremen-  tal product innovations. The innovation literature has identified several important  issues that affect the success or failure of incremental innovation. We argued that  these valuable contributions have not addressed some of the underlying reasons for  the problematic nature of incremental innovation. By using an institutional per-  spective, we have been able to add another important determinant for the success  of the development and implementation of incremental product innovation. We  identified micro institutional forces that affect incremental product innovation and,  as such, contribute to the persistence of innovation problems as identified in the lit-  erature. Scholars studying incremental product innovation could take these forces  into account in their attempts to generate alternative strategies to successfully  develop and implement incremental product innovations. We also expand the inno-  vation literature by explicitly focusing on a service environment, whereas most of  this literature still builds on manufacturing or high-tech industries. Moving into  other empirical fields may also increase our understanding of the problems identi-  fied and could lead to the generation of valuable new ideas to solve these problems.  Our suggestion to both practitioners and academics is not to focus solely on the tra-  ditional determinants that should lead to success but also to take into account a  variety of micro institutional forces from different empirical settings that may be  responsible for the struggle regarding incremental product innovation. This will  increase the chances of resolving the issue of the persistence of these problems.

Vlaar, Frans A.J. Van den Bosch and Henk W. Volberda  Abstract  Research into the management of interorganizational relationships has hitherto primar-  ily focused on problems of coordination, control, and to a lesser extent, legitimacy. In  this article, we assert that partners cooperating in such relationships are also confronted  with ‘problems of understanding’. Such problems arise from differences between part-  ners in terms of culture, experience, structure and industry, and from the uncertainty and  ambiguity that participants in interorganizational relationships experience in early stages  of collaboration. Building on Karl Weick’s theory of sensemaking, we advance that par-  ticipants in interorganizational relationships use formalization as a means to make sense  of their partners, the interorganizational relationships in which they are engaged and the  contexts in which these are embedded so as to diminish problems of understanding. We  offer a systematic overview of the mechanisms through which formalization facilitates  sensemaking, including: (1) focusing participants’ attention; (2) provoking articulation,  deliberation and reflection; (3) instigating and maintaining interaction; and (4) reducing  judgement errors and individual biases, and diminishing the incompleteness and incon-  sistency of cognitive representations. In this way, the article contributes to a better under-  standing of the relationships between formalization and sensemaking in collaborative  relationships, and it carries Karl Weick’s thinking on the relationship between sense-  making and organizing forward in the context of interorganizational management.  Keywords: formalization, sensemaking, understanding, interorganizational cooperation  Introduction  Interorganizational relationships, such as alliances, joint ventures, and outsourc-  ing initiatives are known to entail issues of coordination, control, and legitimacy  (see Kale et al. 2001; Madhok 2002; Sitkin and Bies 1993). However, they also  involve ‘problems of understanding’, which emanate from the fact that participants  in such relationships are accustomed to different structures, cultures, func-  tional capabilities (Barkema and Vermeulen 1997; Doz 1996), cognitive frames  (Nooteboom 1992), terminologies (Kaghan and Lounsbury 2006), and manage-  ment styles and philosophies (Lane and Lubatkin 1998). Problems of under-  standing are aggravated, because cooperating parties come from disparate  backgrounds, and work in different industries, with dissimilar belief systems  (Sutcliffe and Huber 1998). Moreover, especially in early stages of cooperation,  interorganizational relationships are frequently characterized by relatively high  Organization  Studies  27(11): 1617–1638  ISSN 0170–8406  Copyright © 2006  SAGE Publications  (London,  Thousand Oaks,  CA & New Delhi)  Paul W.L.

This leads participants in  such relationships to develop distinct interpretations and understandings of the  same phenomena (Porac et al. 2002; Vaara 2003), and it increases the likelihood  that misinterpretations and misunderstandings occur (Shankarmahesh  et al. 2004). More particularly, it confronts them with difficulties in understanding  their partners, the relationships in which they are engaged and the contexts in  which these are embedded.  Consequently, existing patterns of beliefs and assumptions may have to be  revised, and cognitive reorientations (Fiss and Zajac, in press; Gioia and  Chittipeddi 1991) and the creation of new, more coherent understandings become  imperative for collective action (Maitlis 2005; Weick 1993). Sensemaking  processes are therefore assumed to play a central role during collaborative efforts.  These processes form ‘the primary site where meanings materialize that inform  and constrain’ action (Weick et al. 2005: 409, citing Mills 2003: 35), and they per-  mit parties with ‘different views of the purposes and expectations of a relationship  to achieve congruency’ (Ring and Van de Ven 1994: 99). Although sensemaking  may develop through story-telling and other informal means of communication  (Balogun and Johnson 2005; Kirsch 2004; Rouleau 2005), in the context of  interorganizational relationships, it has been shown to be intricately related to for-  mal processes of negotiating and contracting as well (see Ariño and Ring 2004;  Ring and Rands 1989; Ring and Van de Ven 1989, 1994).  Considering formalization’s relationship with sensemaking, we believe that  formalization is not only the social product or sediment (Kaghan and Lounsbury  2006; Klein Woolthuis et al. 2005; Mayer and Argyres 2004; Putnam and  Cooren 2004), but also a facilitator of sensemaking in interorganizational rela-  tionships, indicating a reciprocal relationship between both concepts (Ring and  Van de Ven 1989, 1994). We suggest that formalization may function as a means  to make sense, enabling participants in collaborative relationships to cope with  problems of understanding. This is supported by Blomqvist et al. (2005: 497),  stating that ‘the contracting process may be used purposefully to increase  mutual understanding’, and by Kaghan and Lounsbury (2006: 260), who argue that  formal written contracts provide a structure ‘within which on-going relationships  can proceed sensibly over time’. Blomqvist et al. (2005: 502), for example, found  that a global machine and equipment supplier and a small metal engineering  company ‘got to know each other through the lengthy contracting process’, indi-  cating that this process enabled them to make sense of their partner. Although  these studies suggest that formalization can be conducive to sensemaking, and  to solving problems of understanding, a systematic overview of the mechanisms  through which this occurs has hitherto been absent in the literature. In this article,  we therefore address the following research question: How does formalization  influence sensemaking, and eventually problems of understanding in interorga-  nizational relationships?  Investigating this question warrants a proper definition of formalization. As  with most concepts ending in ‘-tion’, formalization is ambiguous with regard to  processes and outcomes — ‘between the way one gets there, and the result’  (Baum and Rowley 2002: 1). It refers both to the process of codifying and enforc-  ing inputs, outputs and behaviours (Ouchi 1979), and to the outcomes of this  1618 Organization Studies 27(11)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   process in the form of contracts, rules and procedures (Hage and Aiken 1966).  This distinction becomes obvious when one considers contractual planning — a  principal form of formalization in interorganizational relationships. Contractual  planning consists of the ‘process of projecting exchanges into the future’, but it  also eventuates in promises or obligations that are recorded in contracts, repre-  senting formalization as an outcome (Macneil 1980: 4). We consider both forms  of formalization here, as we presume that the formalization process inevitably  leads to formal documents, and because we believe that formalization ‘accom-  plishes part of its purpose not just with the words agreed upon’, but also by means  of the process through which parties arrive at these words, and through the ‘words  discussed and ultimately rejected’ (Hill 2001: 56). Our ontological view of for-  malization thus covers contracts, rules and procedures (formalization as nouns,  entities or things), as well as processes of codification and enforcement (formal-  ization as an organizing process), which renders our approach to investigating the  relationship between formalization and sensemaking necessarily pluralistic in  nature (see Van de Ven and Poole 2005).  We further investigate our research question by building upon Karl Weick’s  work on sensemaking and organizing (Weick 1969, 1979, 1995, 2001; Weick  et al. 2005), and by critically examining research on interorganizational structuring  practices (e.g. Ariño and Ring 2004; Ring and Rands 1989; Ring and Van de Ven  1989, 1994). In doing so, we focus on the relationships between formalization,  sensemaking, understanding and the mechanisms through which formalization  facilitates sensemaking, including: (1) focusing attention; (2) forcing articula-  tion, deliberation and reflection; (3) instigating and maintaining interaction; and  (4) reducing judgement errors and individual biases, and diminishing incom-  pleteness and inconsistency of cognitive representations (see Figure 1). We argue  that problems of understanding propel the need for formalization, which subse-  quently influences sensemaking through four mechanisms, eventually enabling  participants in interorganizational relationships to achieve more congruent  understandings.  The article provides two contributions. First, it elucidates that interorganiza-  tional relationships not only entail issues of coordination, control and legitimacy,  but also problems of understanding, originating from the differences between  cooperating parties, and from the ambiguity and uncertainty that tend to prevail  in early stages of interorganizational cooperation. This description of cooperative  endeavours conforms to Karl Weick’s accounts of complex, ambiguous events,  and it complements more conventional perspectives on interorganizational gov-  ernance prevailing in the literature (e.g. see Kale et al. 2001; Madhok 2002) by  challenging the assumption that participants in these relationships have clear  images of their partners, the relationships in which they are engaged and the con-  texts in which these are embedded (Jap 2001). Second, the article carries Karl  Weick’s (1969, 1979, 1995, 2001; see also Weick et al. 2005) work on the rela-  tionship between organizing and sensemaking forward in the context of interor-  ganizational relationships. We capitalize on Weick’s contributions in this area to  develop a richer and more comprehensive notion of the relationship between for-  malization, sensemaking, and problems of understanding than has hitherto been  available in the literature on interorganizational relationships.

The article is organized accordingly. First, we briefly discuss problems of  understanding in interorganizational relationships. Subsequently, we elaborate  on four mechanisms through which formalization may facilitate sensemaking,  and help participants in interorganziational relationships to cope with these  problems. We conclude with the major implications of our study and promising  avenues for future research.  Problems of Understanding in Interorganizational Relationships  Discontinuities in structures, contexts, routines, expectations and perceptual  frameworks (Hoang and Rothaermel 2005; Rouleau 2005; Weick 1995; Zollo  et al. 2002) cause problems of understanding in interorganizational relationships,  particularly in early stages of collaboration. They lead participants to interpret  and understand the same phenomena differently (Porac et al. 2002; Sutcliffe and  Huber 1998; Vaara 2003). Such problems are especially pertinent in relation-  ships between unfamiliar partners (Ring and Van de Ven 1994; Sutcliffe and  McNamara 2001) and in complex, cross-sector collaborations, where ‘the  nature of the pie, its size, and an assessment of its ingredients may be ambigu-  ous’ (Jap 2001: 86). In these cases, cooperation brings into tension ‘extraordi-  narily complex ways of framing problems, as well as divergent knowledge and  truth claims based on competing disciplinary paradigms’ (Couchman and Fulop  2002: 43).  Consequently, participants may not fully comprehend each other’s com-  petencies, strengths and weaknesses, and they may find it hard to envision  the projected outcomes of relationships (Jap 2001; Jap and Ganesan 2000).  Furthermore, they may experience difficulties in appreciating the potential for  transacting with each other (Ariño and Ring 2004) due to an absence of unity  in purpose and expectations (Mjoen and Tallman 1997). Problems of under-  standing also tend to prevail when collaborative relationships are embedded in  risky, uncertain settings, and when they involve non-standard business objec-  tives (Jap 2001; McGinn and Keros 2002). In these cases, ambiguity and uncer-  tainty become fundamental concerns (Carson et al. 2006), constraining the  extent to which participants in interorganizational relationships understand their  partners and the new contexts in which they have to act (Meindl et al. 1996;  Ring 2000). In such cases, common or congruent understandings have to be  developed to enable cooperation and joint value creation (Balogun and Johnson  2004; Weick 2001; White and Lui 2005). Participants attempt to ameliorate  their understandings by making sense of their partner, the relationships in which  they are engaged and the contexts in which these are embedded (Kirsch 2004;  Lindenberg 2003; McGinn and Keros 2002; Ring 2000).  Sensemaking, a concept that is central to the work of Karl Weick (e.g. 1969,  1979, 1995, 2001), refers to the reciprocal interaction of information seeking,  Vlaar et al.: Coping with Problems of Understanding 1621   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   meaning ascription and action (Thomas et al. 1993). In the context of this paper,  it concerns the interactive processes by which participants in interorganizational  relationships construct accounts that allow them to comprehend the world and  act collectively (Maitlis 2005; Rouleau 2005; Weick and Roberts 1993). It  derives from the needs of individuals to have a sense of self-identity in relation  to others and to construct a common factual order regarding their social rela-  tionships (Turner 1987). Sensemaking not only concerns identifying, assimilat-  ing and utilizing information, but also removing its equivocality (Weick 1995),  and diminishing participants’ cognitive disorder by foreclosing alternative inter-  pretations and understandings of phenomena (McKinley and Scherer 2000), so  that the world appears more stable and enduring (Weick 1995).  Formalization as a Means to Make Sense  To elucidate how formalization affects sensemaking, we first illuminate Weick’s  position on the relationship between sensemaking and organizing. Although  Weick (1995: 229) contends that ‘a little order can go a long way’, he also  acknowledges that some kind of structure needs to be present to guide action,  and to direct attention to particular aspects of a situation (Weick 1995). He fur-  ther posits that ‘sensemaking and organization constitute one another’ and that  sensemaking involves the ‘continued redrafting of an emerging story so that it  becomes more comprehensive, incorporates more of the observed data, and is  more resilient in the face of criticism’ (Weick et al. 2005: 410–11), which con-  forms to descriptions of negotiation and contracting processes in interorganiza-  tional relationships (e.g. see Mayer and Argyres 2004). Weick (2001: 116) also  asserts that ‘a framework of roles, rules, procedures, configured activities and  authority relations’ can both reflect and facilitate meanings, and that organizing  may help to establish a workable level of uncertainty and ambiguity (Weick  1969, 1979), which corresponds to images of formalization as a means to  reduce and absorb complexity and ambiguity (Carson et al. 2006).  Weick thus acknowledges that organizing processes, such as formalization,  may be conducive to sensemaking. Building on his insights, we further develop  the idea that formalization enables, or even forces collaborating parties to  engage in sensemaking, helping them to create common ground and achieve  mutual understanding (Blomqvist et al. 2005; McGinn and Keros 2002; Ring  and Van de Ven 1989, 1994). As became evident from three alliances in the  Norwegian retailing industry, formal aspects to a large extent anchor, inform,  influence, and add to the informal and implicit understanding of cooperating  parties (Ness 2002: 31), and they assist parties in defining and redefining ‘the  terms of their interdependence’ (Walton and McKersie 1965: 35, as cited in  Putnam 2003). Although this suggests that formalization influences sensemak-  ing, and eventually the creation of generic understandings that form a basis for  interorganizational exchange (Ariño and Ring 2004; McGinn and Keros 2002;  Sivadas and Dwyer 2000), a systematic overview of the mechanisms through  which this may occur is still lacking in the literature. In this article, we develop  such an overview (see Figure 1) by discussing four mechanisms that feature  1622 Organization Studies 27(11)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   prominently in Karl Weick’s work on sensemaking and in literature on formal-  ization, thereby constituting the most important points of contact between both  concepts.  Focusing Attention  A first mechanism through which formalization enables sensemaking is  labelled focusing attention. Participants in interorganizational relationships  generally display a joint focus or co-orientation on formal documents and  processes, which renders formalization a focusing device (Avadikyan et al.  2001; Nooteboom 1992; Sutcliffe and McNamara 2001; Taylor and Robichaud  2004; Yu et al. 2005). Formal documents and processes serve as focal points  for different streams of ongoing activity, providing them with meaning and  direction (Weick 2001; Yakura 2002). They focus attention by clarifying  whether there are decisions that need to be made and what those decisions  might consist of (Weick 2001), and by demarcating what is allowed, expected,  acceptable and possible, and what is not (Carson et al. 2006; Lui and Ngo  2004; Nellore 2001). Formalization helps to selectively highlight some issues  and marginalize or omit others (Brown 2000; Fiss and Zajac, in press), and it  prevents participants from being distracted by issues of secondary importance  (Delmar and Shane 2003) Formal items on agenda meetings, for example,  enable partners to open up discussions on specific issues, and close off discus-  sion on other topics (Putnam 2003) so that participants can focus on a small  number of concerns and expend their cognitive efforts on restricted problem  areas, reducing the cognitive complexity they experience (Boisot and Child  1999; Campbell 1988).  Mayer and Argyres (2004: 400) offer an example of formalization’s role in  focusing attention in their description of a relationship between a Silicon Valley  software firm and a Japanese electronics producer. They note that formal state-  ments of work ‘forced the parties to determine mutually agreeable delivery  dates early in the coding process, before managerial attention on scheduling  was lost’. Similarly, Avadikyan et al. (2001: 1453) describe how a contract for  the development of a fuel-cell powered electric car influenced ‘the method-  ological orientations’ of the participants in this relationship. These examples  show that formalization provides the ‘general direction as to how the parties to  a contract should orient their mutual interaction so as to achieve a common pur-  pose’ (Kaghan and Lounsbury 2006: 267). The resulting focus in attention may  not only reduce the complexity perceived by partners (Boisot and Child 1999),  but it may also enable the absorption of complexity during relationships, pro-  vided that participants remain open and willing to revise formal documents  continuously (Ring 2000), maintain contingencies, and preserve flexibility. In  such cases, formalization becomes a process by which reality is constructed  and reconstructed, instead of a means by which reality is fixed at one point in  time. It then restricts the extent to which participants intrude their environ-  ment and acquire and perceive cues and connections around which they  cohere and structure their beliefs. It also conditions sensemaking by limiting  the information and cues on which participants focus their attention (Anand  Vlaar et al.: Coping with Problems of Understanding 1623   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   and Peterson 2000; Daft and Weick 1984). Summarizing, we argue that  formalization entails a focus of attention, which subsequently influences  sensemaking (see Figure 1).  Proposition 1: Formalization helps participants in interorganizational relation-  ships to focus their attention, thereby affecting their ability to make sense of  their partners, the relationships in which they are engaged and the collabora-  tive contexts in which these are embedded.  Forcing Articulation, Deliberation, and Reflection  A second mechanism through which formalization facilitates sensemaking con-  cerns articulation, deliberation and reflection. Formalization forces parties ‘to  articulate their individual and mutual goals explicitly during the contracting  process’ (Blomqvist et al. 2005: 501). It thereby helps participants to lift equiv-  ocal knowledge out of the tacit, private, complex, random and past, to make it  explicit, simpler, ordered and relevant to the situation at hand (Obstfeld 2004).  By doing so, formalization not only generates more ‘raw material’ from which  cooperating parties can make sense (Daft and Weick 1984; Thomas and Trevino  1993), but also assists in clarifying their identity, positions and payoffs, and the  behaviour and interaction that they prefer, so that interpretable responses by  other participants are elicited (Hill and Levenhagen 1995; Shankarmahesh et al.  2004). Formalization thus ensures ‘that the structural foundations of a deal [are]  well articulated’ (Kaghan and Lounsbury 2006: 274). On an individual level,  such articulation is associated with synthesizing issues on paper, forcing people  to reflect, cogitate, and think deeper (Weick 1995; Zollo and Winter 2002; Zollo  and Singh 2004). It stimulates participants to deliberate beyond general under-  standings, and to be clear about the variables and parameters that need to be  considered, the sequence or priority with which different criteria of decision  making are to be invoked, and the process of inference by which decisions are  to be made (Katz and Kahn 1966). This is reinforced by the fact that participants  wish to avoid unnecessary grievances and mistakes. They therefore give con-  tracts, rules and procedures generally ‘more deliberation than orders’ and try  to make sure that they are ‘carefully expressed’ (Gouldner 1954: 162; see also  Putnam 2003).  An example of formalization’s role in provoking articulation, deliberation  and reflection concerns the negotiation and contracting efforts in an alliance  between Xerox and Fuji Xerox. The Xerox executive for this alliance claimed  that the negotiating teams ‘left no stone unturned.’ He mentioned that ‘a lot of  bright people argued down all the alleys looking for potential future problems’,  and that they spent their time ‘going through all the “what if” questions’. They  continuously ‘took the agreement apart and put it back together’ (Gomes-Casseres  1996: 27). Another example consists of a relationship between a Silicon Valley  software firm and a Japanese electronics producer in which a ‘risk and concern’  section was inserted in formal statements of work in order to ‘force the partici-  pants to think through the project’ (Mayer and Argyres 2004: 400). In contrast,  a lack of formalization may inhibit deliberation and reflection, witnessing a  1624 Organization Studies 27(11)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   relationship between Coca-Cola and Nestlé. When negotiating this deal, ‘too  little attention was paid to the alliance business plan. Market pressures were  such that executives rushed into the collaborative agreement […]. The contract  was signed in one weekend’ (Ariño and Reuer 2004: 45). In this case, a lack of  formalization resulted in low degrees of deliberation and reflection and the rela-  tionship was dissolved after three years, despite a stipulated contract horizon of  one hundred years. Through inducing articulation, deliberation, and reflection,  formalization turns circumstances into words and salient categories that form a  basis for sensemaking (Weick et al. 2005). Moreover, it renders sensemaking  processes more active and animated, and it imbues them with social energy (see  Maitlis 2005). Participants become more heedful (see Weick 1993), question  current assumptions, beliefs and understandings, and actively construct their  new reality. To recapitulate, we argue that formalization facilitates articulation,  deliberation and reflection, and thereby influences sensemaking (see Figure 1).  Proposition 2: Formalization helps participants in interorganizational relation-  ships to articulate, deliberate, and reflect upon issues, thereby affecting their  ability to make sense of their partners, the relationships in which they are  engaged, and the collaborative contexts in which these are embedded.  Instigating and Maintaining Interaction  A third mechanism through which formalization facilitates sensemaking  revolves around its role in instigating and maintaining interaction (Avadikyan  et al. 2001; Balogun and Johnson 2005; Simons 1995). Interaction between par-  ticipants in interorganizational relationships flows through ‘series of formal  processes’ and outcomes (Ring 2000: 154), which serve as frameworks, medi-  ums, or triggers for interaction (Ness 2002; Putnam 2003). Formalization is  used to spin new stories; set actions in motion; announce beginnings, mile-  stones and ends; and trigger changes of course (Avadikyan et al. 2001; Eccles  and Nohria 1992; Weick 1995). It entails the exchange of proposals between  parties, which mediate conversations and dialogues (Nellore 2001; Putnam  2003), and enable parties to discuss tasks not yet executed and outcomes that  still have to be created (Yakura 2002). Formalization involves processes of  arguing, listening and working to reconcile differences (see Weick 2004; Weick  and Roberts 1993), enabling individuals to ‘express their opinions and beliefs,  engage in constructive confrontations, and challenge each other’s viewpoints’  (Zollo and Winter 2002: 341). In this way, participants in collaborative rela-  tionships come to share and synthesize knowledge sets, implicit assumptions  and mental models (Kotabe et al. 2003).  An example of formalization’s role in instigating and maintaining interac-  tion concerns a geographically and organizationally dispersed group of artifi-  cial intelligence language designers, which treated each release of a formal  manual ‘as an event initiating discussion of perceived gaps or problems and fur-  ther proposals and agreements, which in turn led to the next draft’ (Orlikowski  and Yates 2002: 692). Another example concerns two partnerships involving  original-equipment manufacturers in the auto and aircraft industries, where  Vlaar et al.: Coping with Problems of Understanding 1625   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   contracts provided a setting for discussion, allowing partners to ‘understand the  specifications, each other’s capabilities, and the resources needed to do the job’  (Nellore 2001: 502). These examples indicate that formalization entails repre-  sentations of reality through which participants in interorganizational relation-  ships interrelate and make sense of their new situation. Summarizing, we  contend that formalization helps to instigate and maintain interaction among  participants in interorganizational relationships, thereby offering fertile ground  for sensemaking (see Figure 1).  Proposition 3: Formalization instigates and maintains interaction among par-  ticipants in interorganizational relationships and, thereby, affects their ability  to make sense of their partners, the relationships in which they are engaged,  and the collaborative contexts in which these are embedded.  Reducing Biases, Judgement Errors,  Incompleteness, and Inconsistency  Finally, we advance that formalization facilitates sensemaking by reducing the  impact of individual biases and judgement errors, and by augmenting the com-  pleteness and consistency of the cognitive representations that participants  develop of their partners, the relationships in which they are engaged, and the  contexts in which these are embedded. Formalization reduces influences of indi-  vidual biases and judgement errors on collaboration, as it is sensitive to the ideas  and interests of several persons. It compensates for deficiencies in individual  thought processes, such as global and undifferentiated thinking, cognitive near-  sightedness and oversimplified notions of causation (Katz and Kahn 1966;  Ketokivi and Catañer 2004). It therefore tends to result in more nuanced, con-  summate and consistent pictures of reality (Katz and Kahn 1966), increasing the  reliability and predictability of decision-making processes and outcomes  (Sutcliffe and McNamara 2001). This is reinforced by the fact that formalization  requires parties to adopt relatively unambiguous proxies for desired behaviour  and outcomes so that deviations are clearly verifiable (Carson et al. 2006).  Formalization also raises the likelihood that relevant information is consid-  ered and treated properly, and that inconsistencies are uncovered and eliminated  (Avadikyan et al. 2001; Sutcliffe and McNamara 2001). An example stems from  an alliance between L’Oréal and Esthetique, in which additions to the contrac-  tual framework ‘reduced “noise” in the interaction on all levels, as typically  small and recurring conflicts were dealt with once and for all’ (Ness 2002: 25).  An example of a contrasting situation is offered by Doz (1996). In his descrip-  tion of an alliance between Ciba Geigy and Alza aimed at the development of  controlled oral pills and transdermal patches, he indicates that low levels of for-  malization meant ‘that the initial agreement left room for […] widely different  perceptions and broad frames [which] led to growing suspicions and tensions as  each party was searching for clues in the behaviour of the other’ (Doz 1996: 68).  These examples indicate that formalization may enable participants in interor-  ganizational relationships to make sense of their new situation by reducing the  impact of biases and judgement errors, and by increasing the consistency and  1626 Organization Studies 27(11)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   completeness of their cognitive representations. This is captured in a fourth  proposition (see Figure 1).  Proposition 4: Formalization reduces the impact of individual biases and judge-  ment errors, and it diminishes incompleteness and inconsistencies among the  cognitive representations held by participants in interorganizational relation-  ships, thereby affecting their ability to make sense of their partners, the rela-  tionships in which they are engaged, and the collaborative contexts in which  these are embedded.  Towards a Balanced View  In previous paragraphs, we argued that formalization facilitates sensemaking  through four mechanisms, possibly turning ambiguous or equivocal circum-  stances into a situation that is ‘comprehended explicitly in words and that serves  as a springboard into action’ (Weick et al. 2005: 409, citing Taylor and Van  Every 2000: 40 AQ). Formalization assists participants in testing and establish-  ing expectations as to how roles and responsibilities are divided, how partners  are doing, and how they will react to what one says and does (Hill and King  2004; Klein Woolthuis et al. 2005; Narayandas and Rangan 2004; Sivadas and  Dwyer 2000; Weick and Roberts 1993), and it enables them to assess and appre-  ciate the nature and purpose of relationships (Ring and Van de Ven 1994).  Formalization further helps participants to discover the amount of agreement  they have on cause–effect linkages and on priorities and preferences for out-  comes, which coincides with a description of sensemaking in early stages by  Weick and McDaniel (1989). Formalization may thus help participants to make  sense of their partners, the relationships in which they are engaged and the con-  texts in which these are embedded, by offering them ‘a collaborative framework  in which the potential for joint action is both significant and beneficial’ (Hardy  et al. 2005: 63).  However, we recognize that formalization may also have negative effects on  sensemaking, as it may make events seem more comprehensible and control-  lable than they really are (Brown 2004), fuelling the illusion that ‘management’  or ‘control’ are in place (Brown 2000; Yakura 2002). Furthermore, high degrees  of formalization may result in psychic imprisonment (Snell 2002), so that sub-  sequent sensemaking activities proceed within overly narrow analytical and  decision-making boundaries (Ring 2000). In such cases, formalization leads to  a focus of attention that is too rigid or inappropriate, which may lead managers  to ignore or overlook critical factors, and renders their understandings too parsi-  monious, myopic, or otherwise incongruent with reality (Hill and Levenhagen  1995; Sutcliffe and McNamara 2001). In this respect, Weick (2001: 460) men-  tions that ‘once a sense of the situation begins to develop, that sense can be  terribly seductive and can resist updating and revision’. It may also lead man-  agers to lose ‘sight of the forest’ while picking away ‘at the branches and  leaves of the trees’ (Putnam 2003: 48). This was evident in Doz’s (1996: 68)  description of an alliance between Ciba Geigy and Alza, where sensemaking led  Vlaar et al.: Coping with Problems of Understanding 1627   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   to cognitive understandings that ‘made the behavioural learning agenda look  taller and taller’.  Formalization has other disadvantages in that it can easily turn into formal-  ism (Mintzberg 1994), cause rigidity and a loss of creativity and flexibility  (Volberda 1998), and diminish trust (Klein Woolthuis et al. 2005). Moreover,  formal attempts to articulate, deliberate and reflect upon issues may entail high  costs and efforts, and they can hamper interaction if their benefits are unclear to  participants in collaborative endeavours. Furthermore, formalization may not  only diminish but also introduce biases and errors, if it reflects desired out-  comes and behaviours inappropriately. We acknowledge the fact that formal-  ization has a dark side, and that it can generate undesired and unanticipated  outcomes (Balogun and Johnson 2005; Yu et al. 2005). Or, as Mintzberg (1994:  386) notes, ‘formalization is a double-edged sword, easily reaching the point  where help becomes hindrance’. We therefore conclude that the relationship  between formalization and sensemaking is likely to be a curvilinear one, in  which formalization contributes to sensemaking up to a certain point, through  each of the four mechanisms that we distinguished previously, after which it  diminishes participants’ capacity for sensemaking (see Figure 1).  Proposition 5: The extent to which formalization enables participants to:  (1) focus their attention; (2) articulate, deliberate, and reflect; (3) interact, and:  (4) reduce judgement errors, biases, and incompleteness and inconsistency of  their cognitive representations has a curvilinear relationship with their ability  to make sense of their partners, the relationships in which they are engaged,  and the contexts in which these are embedded.  Finally, we propose that formalization may help to solve problems of under-  standing by facilitating sensemaking in interorganizational relationships.  Formalization is one way of organizing by which people make sense of equiv-  ocal inputs, which they enact back into their world to make it more orderly  (Weick et al. 2005). This may eventuate in more refined understandings of part-  ners’ cultures, management systems, capabilities and weaknesses, and offer par-  ticipants more clarity about the context in which relationships are embedded  (Zollo et al. 2002). Formalization may affect sensemaking in such a way that  participants in interorganizational relationships create ‘a solid understanding of  the business, share a common fact base, and agree on important assumptions’  (Kaplan and Beinhocker 2003: 72). In this way, they may gradually come to  understand the nature of the pie that can be created in their relationship, the size  of that pie, and the processes and resources that could help create the pie (Jap  2001). Moreover, they can improve their understanding of each other’s inten-  tions, actions and behaviour (Aulakh and Madhok 2002). The resulting collec-  tive consciousness (Clegg et al. 2002; Hill 2001), common reality, or shared  understandings (Brown 2004; Hardy et al. 2005; Putnam and Cooren 2004)  offer them a unitary basis for action (Maitlis 2005; Weick and Roberts 1993).  This does not imply that partners need to have the same point of view, or under-  stand each other completely. Plurivocal interpretations and understanding will  always persist among organizational actors due, among other reasons, to lasting  differences in prior experience (see Balogun and Johnson 2004; Brown 2000,  1628 Organization Studies 27(11)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   2004), and distinct interests and objectives. However, formalization’s effects on  sensemaking at least increase the likelihood that participants in interorganizational  relationships develop mutual understandings next to their private understandings,  which may enable coordinated action, while preserving the complexity of multiple  individual cognitive structures (Barr and Huff 1997; Elsbach et al. 2005; Weick  1995; Weick and Roberts 1993). Concluding, we advance that formalization  affects sensemaking processes, which subsequently influence problems of under-  standing among participants in interorganizational relationships (see Figure 1).  Proposition 6: Through enabling participants in interorganizational relation-  ships to make sense of their partners, the relationships in which they are  engaged, and the contexts in which these are embedded, formalization reduces  the degree to which participants in interorganizational relationships experience  problems of understanding.  Discussion  In this article, we have exemplified how formalization may help participants in  interorganizational relationships to cope with problems of understanding. We  have shown that formalization entails socio-psychological processes through  which participants socially construct or ‘enact’ their realities (Ariño and Ring  2004; Vaara 2003; Weick 1995) and by which they reduce the cognitive disor-  der, ambiguity and uncertainty that they experience (Carson et al. 2006;  McKinley and Scherer 2000; Weick 1979, 1995, 2001, 2004). Collectively, our  arguments depict formalization as a process of ‘constructive clarification’  (Cardinal et al. 2004: 422) by which particular versions of reality are created,  clarified, sustained and modified (Brown 2004), and as a form of structuring  that generates and recreates meanings (Ranson et al. 1980). Our description  accommodates several distinguishing features of sensemaking such as   ‘its genesis in disruptive ambiguity [e.g. the initiation of a new relationship], its begin-  nings in acts of noticing and bracketing [e.g. codification], its mixture of retrospect and  prospect [e.g. different experiences of partners combined with converging understand-  ings], [and] its culmination in articulation that shades into acting [formalization as a  basis for action]’. (Weick et al. 2005: 413)  Our discussion of formalization suggests that it strongly resembles notions of  sensemaking as a ‘guided and controlled’ process, which results in the creation  of more unitary and rich accounts of reality, that provide ‘common foundations  for action’ and enable ‘the emergence of series of actions with a consistent  focus’ (Maitlis 2005: 28).  It is important to note here that sensemaking efforts are undertaken in con-  cert with sensegiving efforts, so as to ‘influence the sensemaking and meaning  construction of others’ (Gioia and Chittipeddi 1991: 442). Although sensemak-  ing is essentially a cognitive concept, while sensegiving also refers to commu-  nication (Shankarmahesh et al. 2004), both concepts are associated with the  management of meaning (Maitlis 2005) and with continuous processes of orga-  nizing (Weick et al. 2005). Sensegiving efforts by some participants give rise to  Vlaar et al.: Coping with Problems of Understanding 1629   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   sensemaking efforts by others, rendering both concepts interactional comple-  ments (Gioia and Chittipeddi 1991; Rouleau 2005). Although we focused on the  influence of formalization on sensemaking in this paper, formalization may  equally well serve sensegiving, and assist participants in framing and dissemi-  nating issues to stakeholders (Fiss and Zajac, in press), or enable them to provide  descriptions and explanations, and create opportunities for interaction that help  others to make sense (Maitlis 2005; Weick 1995).  Theoretical and Practical Implications  This article advances prior research on the sensemaking function of formaliza-  tion (Ring and Van de Ven 1989, 1994) by discerning the mechanisms through  which formalization facilitates the creation of more congruent understand-  ings among participants in interorganizational relationships. It indicates that  researchers may benefit from embracing the inherent qualities of the process of  formalization itself, instead of focusing on contracts, rules and procedures  alone, something which is congruent with pleas by Weick and other researchers  for more research into structuring processes (see Ariño and De la Torre 1998;  Carson et al. 2006; De Rond and Bouchikhi 2004; Narayandas and Rangan  2004; Ring and Van de Ven 1994; Weick 2001; Weick et al. 2005). Moreover,  our conceptualization of formalization implies that researchers should regard  formalization as a means to achieve coordination, control, and legitimacy, but  also as a means to cope with problems of understanding in interorganizational  relationships. This implies that researchers may have to redirect their attention  from coercive towards enabling types of formalization (see Adler and Borys  1996; Zollo and Winter 2002) in which higher levels of understanding (Zollo  and Singh 2004) and the constitution of meaning (Giddens 1984) assume a  more central position. Furthermore, premises of power, self-interest and oppor-  tunism (Williamson 1985) seem to become less significant when discussing for-  malization’s role in coping with problems of understanding. Nevertheless, the  creation of new understandings is not free of power issues and self-interested  behaviour (Brown 2000, 2004). Parties will, for example, attempt to influence  and shape each other’s beliefs in the direction that they prefer, and they fre-  quently interpret phenomena with these interests in mind. Moreover, they may  choose not to give other parties particular information for strategic reasons, or  use their power to make sure that issues are (not) captured in formal documents.  This implies that formalization has to be regarded as ambivalent, in the sense  that it is a vehicle of several functions (Avadikyan et al. 2001; Madhok 2002),  something which renders either-or discussions on its role in interorganizational  relationships unproductive (Klein Woolthuis et al. 2005).  Practitioners could use the insights generated in this article to establish more  congruent understandings among participants in the relationships in which they  are involved. This will prove to be particularly useful when such relationships  are characterized by large inter-partner differences and high degrees of ambi-  guity and uncertainty. In such cases, simply exchanging more information may  not solve their problems, and efforts have to be put into shaping interpretations  and understandings (Sutcliffe and Weber 2003; Thomas and Trevino 1993).  1630 Organization Studies 27(11)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   This article has shown that formalization may be an important means for doing  so. More specifically, the article offers practitioners insights into how formal-  ization facilitates sensemaking, and how it helps to develop more congruent  understandings in collaborative relationships.  Future Research  Opportunities for future research are abundant. First, researchers could investi-  gate how power, politics, and resource and information asymmetries affect  sensegiving and sensemaking in collaborative relationships. Such factors pro-  vide different people with unequal positions from which they influence the  social construction of reality (Mills 2003). They affect, among other aspects, the  extent to which parties have control over cues, communicate with each other  and support or constrain each other’s actions and behaviour (Weick et al. 2005).  Moreover, when resource and information asymmetry exists between partners,  participants are likely to perceive different cues and attribute different meanings  to similar observations. After all, people interpret cues in light of their expecta-  tions and knowledge (Weick 1995). Power, politics and resource and information  asymmetries thus exert fundamental influences over sensegiving and sense-  making processes, rendering them important areas for future research.  Second, researchers could inquire into the relationship between the develop-  ment of congruent understandings and other functions of formalization. Hitherto,  it has remained unclear how better understandings of partners in interorganiza-  tional relationships affect coordination, control and legitimacy. Several indications  exist that these functions presuppose sensemaking. We know, for example, that  sensemaking processes contribute to envisioning how value can be created  (Ariño and Ring 2004), and that they assist in removing misunderstandings,  information asymmetry, and opportunities for moral hazard and opportunistic  behaviour. We also know that these processes could lead to a more accurate  appreciation of the risks involved in a transaction, which should result in the  design of more appropriate governance structures (Ring and Rands 1989; Ring  and van de Ven 1989, 1994), and which enables parties to develop a solid basis  for their relationships, while tempering hubris and faddishness (Sampson  2003). However, a systematic overview of the relationships between formaliza-  tion, understanding and its other functions is not yet available. Related to this,  researchers could attempt to develop a parsimonious yet comprehensive con-  ceptual framework that allows for more systematic comparisons of the func-  tions and dysfunctions, and eventually the performance effects of formalization  across studies and contexts, than currently presented in the literature (see White  and Lui 2005). A dialectic perspective in which the functions and dysfunctions  of formalization are considered simultaneously could be a promising area for  further investigation here (De Rond and Bouchikhi 2004).  A third option for future research concerns inquiries into organization, con-  text, and task characteristics that determine how the need for sensemaking  evolves. We have presumed that the sensemaking function of formalization is  particularly valuable for interorganizational relationships between partners pos-  sessing divergent skills, backgrounds and organizational structures, and for  Vlaar et al.: Coping with Problems of Understanding 1631   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   organizations based in disparate cultures or industries, as these differences can  lead to misunderstandings and conflicts (Child and Rodrigues 2003). However,  as partners get to know each other better and information asymmetries are being  reduced, the need for sensemaking diminishes (Heide 2003), and issues become  more clear-cut (see Koza and Lewin 1998; Rothaermel and Deeds 2004).  Parties may have developed joint understandings that allow for uniquely effi-  cient communication in the form of idiosyncratic interaction routines (Hoang  and Rothaermel 2005; Kotabe et al. 2003; Zollo et al. 2002) and they may have  come to know more about each other’s structures, operations and competencies  (Shenkar and Zeira 1992). Ring and Van de Ven (1994) therefore conclude that,  in general, once the details of a cooperative relationship are established, sense-  making processes tend to be less intense than those that occur during transactional  phases, at least until problems arise. This suggests that it is both worthwhile to  investigate when the sensemaking function of formalization is most pertinent,  and how it evolves over time.  A final avenue for future research pertains to investigating other means that  facilitate sensemaking, such as informal processes of interaction (Balogun and  Johnson 2005), and examining the factors that influence managers’ preferences  for each of them. An example of such a factor could be the likelihood that rela-  tionships experience negative effects of employee turnover (Ring and Van de  Ven 1994). The departure of two founding fathers in a joint venture in the con-  sumer products industry between a North American and a French company  illustrates our point. Ariño and De la Torre (1998: 321) explain that ‘agreements  and understandings that may have been implicit in their thinking, or that could  have been articulated in an informal telephone call, [were] now easily misinter-  preted by those not involved in the original design and negotiations’. In this  case, formalization could have prevented knowledge dissipation and facilitated  continued sensemaking and learning.  Concluding, the article contributes to research on organizing and sensemaking  by discussing how formalization may help participants in interorganizational rela-  tionships to cope with problems of understanding. By doing so, it carries Karl  Weick’s thinking on sensemaking forward in the context of interorganizational  management, and it offers a fertile basis for further theorizing in this field.

VAN DEN BOSCH  Discerning a Key Characteristic of a  European Style of Management  Managing the Tension between Integration  Opportunities and the Constraining Diversity in  Europe  In 1991, Thurley and Wirdenius claimed that intemational companies operat-  ing in European countries could, and should, make a strategic choice whether  or not to develop a "European" approach or style of management. After the  acceptance of the Treaty of Maastricht, and with the new European Union  preparing to absorb applicants from the European Free Trade Association,  their claim is becoming even more important. Not surprisingly, a European  style of management, or "European management," is an important topic for  business, business schools, and academic research. While a growing number  of publications have been written on this subject, a brief review of the litera-  ture on European management reveals a clear tension between "integration  opportunity" and "constraining diversity" issues as a challenging problem for  managers in Europe.  This article investigates whether key characteristics of a European style of  management can be discerned. To this end, a conceptual framework is developed  for reconciling the observed tension and pinpointing a key common characteris-  tic of a European style of management. No attempt is made here to show that  national styles of management such as Swedish or British management (Barsoux  and Lawrence, 1990) will disappear in the fiiture. On the contrary, we maintain  that national styles of management are and will remain part of Europe's diversity  (Lessem and Neubauer, 1994). We aim to improve our understanding of how  management relates to the European business environment as a contingency  factor. In particular, we investigate ways of approaching the above-mentioned  management problem in Europe. In a general sense, our research contributes to  The authors are, respectively.

We begin with a short overview of the literature and draw attention to the  tension between integration opportunities and constraining diversity for manag-  ers in Europe. We then introduce a managerial perspective in describing various  relevant forms of an important contextual variable of Europe—namely, diversity.  After developing a conceptual framework for reconciling this tension, we de-  scribe how this framework can focus attention on a key characteristic of a Euro-  pean style of management. We use a case study of Unilever Foods Europe to  illustrate the proposed conceptual framework. In discussing our findings, we  touch upon some implications for developing the distinctive managerial skills  required by a European style of management and suggest directions for future  research.  The tension between integration opportunities and the  constraining diversity  The emerging field of European management is not clearly delineated in the  literature. It can be described as "management in Europe," as opposed to man-  agement in North America or in Japan. Or as "the 'best practice' shared by top  directors of many of Europe's biggest companies' (Bloom, Calori, and de Woot,  1994, p. 131). Another approach is proposed by Thurley and Wirdenius (1989),  who address the question, "How far do current and emerging European social,  cultural, economic and political aims and objectives lead to a model of manage-  ment which is distinct from American and Japanese models?" They also stress  that "European management should . . . be understood to refer not to current  practice but to a possible alternative approach" (p. 4, emphasis in original).  Lessem and Neubauer (1994) focus on the management styles of four leading  European economies and reveal both the diversity and the underlying unity of  management in Europe. Calori and de Woot (1994) looked for common charac-  teristics of management across Europe on the basis of interviews held with top  managers of forty large intemational companies with headquarters or major op-  erations in Europe. They found four common characteristics of management that  were distinctive in Europe in the sense that these characteristics differentiated  management in Europe from North America and Japan. In their view, such  common characteristics are the ingredients of a European management model.  We will not elaborate, however, on differences between European, North Ameri-  can, and Japanese styles of management, as conducted in the above-cited refer-  ences. Instead, we will investigate whether the ways of managing this tension in  Europe can become a key common characteristic of a European approach or  style of management and, therefore, a key ingredient of a European management  model as well.  The large variety of publications on European management can be arranged in  A EUROPEAN STYLE OF MANAGEMENT III  many ways. For example, a review can be organized according to their purpose  (e.g., descriptive versus prescriptive), according to various issues (e.g., leader-  ship, impact of the Single European Market), or according to the functions of  management (e.g., marketing, human-resource management, finance, strategy).  Sharing the concem of Thurley and Wirdenius (1989, p. 38) and Bartlett and  Ghoshal (1993, p. 25) that the problems of managers are too often neglected in  the management literature, we chose the last way of arranging the review using  Fayol's framework.  As one of the first European theorists, Fayol (1949) noticed that six activities  can be distinguished in each organization: production, marketing, finance and  accounting, human resources, information, and management. The first five activ-  ities are usually considered ftinctional areas of management. The last, manage-  ment, focuses more than the other five activities on the processes needed to  direct the organization. Fayol's definition of management comprises five ele-  ments: forecasting and planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating, and  controlling. On the basis of these elements, three broad areas in the management  literature can be identified: organization, business environment, and strategy.  Together with the five functional areas of management, these eight broad areas  of the management literature have helped us to categorize publications about  management within a European context and to briefly analyze them. For each of  these eight broad areas, two contributions of the last five years have been se-  lected for illustrative purposes, as shown in the first row of Table 1.  One can detect at least two recurring issues from these publications—^"inte-  gration opportunity" and "constraining diversity." The former issue deals with  the managerial and organizational implications of the changes for firms in their  business environment due to European integration. Different authors have ana-  lyzed these implications and have suggested appropriate reactions to integration  (row 2 of Table 1). Usually, they have seen it as an opportunity, often in a  short-term perspective. In this connection, a prominent view about the single  European market is that it will lead to greater opportunities for realizing econo-  mies of scale and new opportunities to acquire specific resources. Examples are  opportunities created by the increased efficiency of the financial market, the  possibility to transfer personnel across national borders, and strategic partner-  ships that straddle national borders.  A second recurring issue in many publications is that the main characteristic  of Europe, its diversity, still prevails. Although the European integration process  of the last decade has facilitated the need to work across national borders, firms  are still confronted with various important and structural forms of diversity in  terms of intra-European differences in preferences, habits, languages, and cul-  tures ("Nowhere do cultures differ so much as inside Europe," writes  Trompenaars [1993, p. 8]) that are inherited and seem to resist change (see row 3  of Table 1). Diversity is recognized as the constraint within which firms must  exploit European integration opportunities.  112  <0  c2  '>  LU  CO E  « cIf  N  i 2  o  g  o  if  III  2 §  £ E  1  § ^ S > c  X 2 E  oB E ...

For example, the opportunities that integration  offers for production involve the increase of efficiency and better access to  specific resources. In this view, the appeal of European integration is that econo-  mies of scale are present and unexploited in most sectors, and that large-scale  rationalization is likely to occur, leaving a small number of mass producers from  which standardized products will flow. Although integration of production plants  is tempting and taking place within Europe, companies still have to adapt to the  customary ways of doing business in each country and to local product, safety,  and quality standards. Moreover, the complexity of the environment requires an  increase in the flexibility of the production system (De Meyer, Nakana, Miller,  and Ferdows, 1989).  In investigating the observed tension between integration opportunities and  constraining diversity in Europe, we chose a managerial perspective. The prob-  lems this tension creates for managers have to be analyzed within the context in  which these problems must be solved. Furthermore, attention must be paid to the  managerial action that is required within this context to solve these problems.  This requires a conceptual framework in which the changing European context  and the management of various forms of diversity are interdependent. Before we  discuss how the acquired capabilities or skills of managing this tension could  create a common characteristic of a European management approach, we shall  look at different types of diversity in Europe.  Three types of diversity  We distinguish three important types of diversity in the negotiated environment,  in administrative diversity, and in inherited diversity (see Table 2). These three  types differ with respect to their relation with an external or internal managerial  perspective regarding diversity, the time perspective involved, and, related to  that, the possibility of influencing diversity by management. Diversity in the  negotiated environment relates to diversity that is still prevalent because the  process of integration of various national markets is still ongoing in Europe.  Major obstacles for eliminating this type of diversity are based on differences in  legislation, regulations, and governmental policies among the member states of  the European Union. Substantial differences between, for example, technical  regulations (standards, testing, and certification procedures) and public procure-  ment practices still remain, but the European Commission is trying to harmonize  the relevant legislations, regulations, and governmental policies. This harmoniza-  tion process, in which business itself also plays an important role, will result, for  example, in less variation in tax rules, subsidization practices, financial reporting  requirements, quality standards, and contractual relations between employer and  employee. Although various obstacles have to be overcome, such as problems in  A EUROPEAN STYLE OF MANAGEMENT 115  Table 2  Three types of diversity  Types of diversity Examples  Diversity in negotiated environment Tax rules  Subsidization practices  Financial reporting requirements  Quality and product standards  Administrative diversity Internal accounting rules  Information systems  Manufacturing systems  Inherited diversity Customer preferences  Employee characteristics  Business systems  harmonizing accounting practices (Blake and Amat, 1994), this first type of  diversity should gradually decrease.  Administrative diversity is chosen to designate the second type of diversity,  which can be reduced, at least in principle, by an active or, even better, proactive  strategic role played by the company itself or by a combination of companies.  Examples are the diversity of internal accounting rules, of information systems,  and of manufacturing systems. Greater understanding of, say, coding practices in  the various countries will lead to improved efficiency in management reporting  and greater simplicity in the construction of systems for producing management  information and statutory information across the national and cultural boundaries  of Europe (Gray, 1991). Consistency in the definition of data elements and  information structures, as another example, can improve the exchange of infor-  mation and the realization of economies of scale.  While, from a managerial perspective, both the diversity in the negotiated  environment and the administrative diversity are more or less endogenous over  time, the third type of diversity is more resistant to change. Inherited diversity is  rooted in the distinctive historical differences among the member states, regions,  and ethnic groups of the European Union. Removing the formal barriers to trade  will not be sufficient to overcome barriers due to, say, tastes, preferences, and  habits. Moreover, most of the institutions that structure broad configurations of  firm-market relations are cultural and national, rather than sectoral, as described  by Whitley (1992). With respect to inherited diversity, we can distinguish three  key categories: customer preferences, employee characteristics, and business  systems.' The first two categories relate to people, the third to institutional  arrangements both within and among firms and other organizations as carriers of  relatively durable diversity in societies. As a result, inherited diversity has devel-  oped through cultural infiuences and institutionalization processes (e.g., educa-  116 BOONE AND VAN DEN BOSCH (NETHERLANDS)  tion, legislation) in previous decades and even centuries. Consequently, this type  of diversity will probably not change dramatically in the coming years.  Hence, the idea that the ongoing intemationalization of firms and markets in  Europe will establish a kind of distinctive pan-European business system in  which there is no place for diversity can be criticized. Whitley (1994, pp. 11&-  119) observes:  [The] intemational standardization of forms of economic organization and  transfer of managerial practices vary greatly between economies with different  degrees of institutional integration and state coordination, according to the  relative strengths of each economy and centrality of particular sectors to them,  and between business system characteristics with different degrees of interde-  pendence with dominant institutions. Thus, the intemationalization of firms  and markets does not lead necessarily to the establishment of a single most  efficient way of organizing economic activities, but rather has different conse-  quences for different economies and different kinds of managerial practices  depending on the nature, strength and cohesion of social institutions.  We agree with Whitley's analysis and stress that managing diversity in Europe  will not be a temporary issue; on the contrary, it is likely to be a long-lasting  challenge.  Managers active in the European context are confronted with a challenging  problem. From a managerial perspective, the tension we have observed between  integration opportunities and constraining diversity cannot be ignored; it needs,  rather, to be managed within the European context. Firms in Europe must seek to  benefit from this tension and, to this end, try to develop managerial capabilities.  By doing so, firms react to the decreasing negotiated and administrative diversity  and build up competencies and capabilities over time to manage the remaining  inherited diversity. We label this reaction with respect to the changing business  environment an externally oriented managerial perspective, and the building up  of managerial capabilities or skills an internally oriented managerial perspective.  In the 1990s, theoretical developments in the strategy and intemational business  field have stressed the importance of this dual approach; "Strategy . . . cannot be  separated from its context, which includes not only extemal environmental de-  mands but also intemal organizational processes and the factors, like quality of  management, culture, and history that shape those processes" (Bartlett and  Ghoshal, 1991, p. 9). Hence, in analyzing the observed tension for managers in a  changing European context, a combination of both extemally oriented and inter-  nally oriented managerial perspectives is essential.  A conceptual framework  On the basis of these observations, we propose that a successfiil way of ap-  proaching the management problem induced by European integration requires  that two separate but interdependent processes take place within the management  A EUROPEAN STYLE OF MANAGEMENT 117  function (see figure 1). First, the establishment of the integrated market has  created various changes in the business environment that can be analyzed by, for  example. Porter's (1990) "diamond" framework (Van den Bosch and Van Pro-  oijen, 1992). These changes force companies to adopt an "extemally oriented  managerial perspective." This perspective is associated with the first process, as  depicted in the left part of figure 1.  Companies are confî onted with various opportunities and threats to which  they have to react if they are to maintain or improve their competitive advantage.  As our brief overview of the literature reveals, these reactions are largely exe-  cuted within separate functional areas of management. The decreasing diversity  in the negotiated environment stimulates the integration of various production  plants, the creation of European work forces, and the emergence of marketing  programs for the European market. Moreover, managers have to reduce intemal  administrative diversity to be able to exploit the various integration opportunities  and optimize the intemal operations of European organizations. In this respect,  the above definitions of data elements, information systems, and management  accounting systems have to be made coherent. Besides these reactions to the  changing European business environment, however, management capabilities  have to be developed over time to make a European firm really work. So, in the  face of European integration, more intemally oriented processes within the man-  agement function must also take place.  This "intemally oriented managerial perspective," as the second process de-  picted in the right-hand part of figure 1, is motivated by the need to develop  context-related managerial capabilities. As stated before, successful management  within a European context depends upon the ability to handle the existing diver-  sity in Europe. Hence, the intemally oriented perspective does not focus on  attempts to eliminate the inherited diversity. On the contrary, managers are rec-  ognizing this diversity, and with it, a possibly disproportionate growth of the  complexity they face. This growing awareness demands and stimulates structural  adaptations of the organization. Ashby's law of "requisite variety" (Ashby,  1956), that the intemal regulatory mechanism of a system must be as diverse as  the environment with which it is trying to cope, also argues that the intemal  capabilities have to be "upgraded" to be able to cope with increased diversity  and to achieve the same organizational goals as before.  On the strategic level, the most difficult task will be to cope with the tension  between these two processes. This tension stresses the need for managing both  the integration and differentiation (Lawrence and Lorsch, 1969) suited to the  European business environment. Organizations need integration to ensure that  the system does not break down into separate elements. Integration adds value to  business units and must provide benefits that offset the inherent costs of lost  independence. The forces for differentiation, however, are very strong in Europe.  The third type of diversity within Europe, inherited diversity, stresses the need  for a flexible and market-oriented organization. Managing this type of diversity  118 BOONE AND VAN DEN BOSCH (NETHERLANDS)  within the constraint of required integration demands specific managerial skills.  Through the interaction between the two processes, depicted as "interdepen-  dent processes" in the lower part of figure 1, a dynamic process of managerial  learning emerges to cope with the new situation. In different jobs within different  business and operating company contexts, managers accumulate business con-  text knowledge and organizational knowledge similar to the two discemed per-  spectives in our framework. Over time, this learning process can result in  dynamic managerial capabilities. In Europe, these dynamic managerial capabili-  ties are interwoven with the specific European context to such an extent, espe-  cially with respect to inherited diversity, that we propose to consider these  capabilities as a key common characteristic of a European style of management.  Focus on dynamic managerial capabilities  As highlighted in our conceptual framework (see the right part of figure 1), the  internally oriented managerial perspective stimulates the development of new  managerial capabilities. This perspective can be related to a trend in management  development and human-resource management, highlighting a skill-based ap-  proach (Lawler and Ledford, 1992, pp. 388-389). Such a connection between  managerial capabilities in our framework and new developments in the human-  resource management field can provide clues for further research, as discussed  later.  The first aspect of capabilities we emphasize is the dynamic one. The mana-  gerial capabilities resulting from a dynamic process of managerial learning to  cope with the observed tension are definitely not static. Because of ongoing  developments in the European business environment, partly infiuenced by devel-  opments in other major regional trade blocs, the required capabilities change as  well. Hence, our framework emphasizes dynamic managerial capabilities. The  second aspect of capabilities is related to this dynamic process as well and in  particular to leaming. This learning process can be analyzed from the perspective  of an evolutionary theory of the capabilities and behavior of firms (Nelson and  Winter, 1982) and is related to the emerging interest in knowledge creation as a  sustainable competitive advantage of firms (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995).  The knowledge created by being active in Europe can be thought of as resid-  ing in organizational routines—that is, in the regular and predictable behavior  pattems of firms (Nelson and Winter, 1982). Managing diversity in Europe chal-  lenges innovations in these organizational routines. Because of the complexity of  such behavioral pattems, knowledge embedded in organizational routines cannot  be fully captured in a codified form because it has a tacit dimension that often  cannot be readily articulated or imitated. We propose that these organizational  routines, and the managerial capabilities to call upon the organization to perform  and coordinate them, represent a key characteristic of a "European style of  management."

Further-  more, the case study's unique strength relative to other research strategies such  120 BOONE AND VAN DEN BOSCH (NETHERLANDS)  as experimentation and surveys is its ability to encompass a variety of evidence  such as documents, questionnaires, interviews, and observations (Eisenhardt,  1989). The data in our case study are drawn from interviews with executives,  internal company documents, public data, and Unilever's annual accounts  (1992-94).  Case study: UnUever Foods Europe  Responding to new competitive conditions in its business environment, the Uni-  lever corporation has evolved into one of the foremost transnational companies  (Maljers, 1992). With more than 1,000 brands in the brand-name consumer  goods business (foods, detergents, and personal products), a tumover of US$45  billion in 1994, 304,000 employees working in one of the 80 countries where  Unilever has operating companies, and two European parent companies in the  Netherlands and the UK operating as nearly as practicable as a single entity,  Unilever makes, so to speak, a living out of diversity.  Unilever has always been a rather decentralized company (Bartlett and  Ghoshal, 1989) and has not sought extensively to obtain the benefits of very  large-scale production. A former cochairman of Unilever stated: "Unilever con-  sists of hundreds of individual operating companies—each with their own iden-  tity" (Maljers, 1990, p. 64). Unilever has been strongly market-driven and has  differentiated itself from its competitors by its marketing skills and its local  adaptations (Business Week, 1994). Substantial country-to-country differences in  consumer tastes, preferences, and practices, as well as market structures, distri-  bution channels, and local regulatiotis have motivated top management to allow  extensive operating independence of Unilever's subsidiaries (Maljers, 1992).  Moreover, rising trade barriers have, until recently, always reinforced the need  for managerial autonomy at the subsidiary level.  Over half of Unilever's tumover originates in foods. In the early 1990s,  however, decreasing growth in the European food market intensified competition  with such companies as Nestle, Philip Morris, and Sara Lee, while the creation  of a unified European economic market forced Unilever's European food compa-  nies to reevaluate their strategies. Competitive advantage eould no longer be won  by national responsiveness and differentiation alone. Increased integration among  the national companies became more and more necessary to exploit potential advan-  tages such as economies of scale, operational fiexibility, and accelerated leaming by  knowledge exchange.^ By lowering trade barriers and reducing diversity in the  negotiated environment, the Europe 1992 program forced Unilever to look be-  hind market differences and evaluate whether more integration could be created  without sacrificing the advantages of diversity (Edelman, 1994).  One particular element of Unilever Foods Europe's business activities—  namely, its sourcing activities—seemed to provide major integration opportuni-  ties. Sourcing, as defined by Unilever, is all business operations from selecting  A EUROPEAN STYLE OF MANAGEMENT 121  suppliers through buying, storing, and handling components, manufacturing fin-  ished products, and handling and dispatching finished goods to customers. With  some 46 companies, 130 factories, 250 warehouses, and total revenues exceed-  ing US$23 billion, sourcing in Unilever Foods Europe may be called rather  complex. In early 1990, the Foods Executive Sourcing Group (FESG) was estab-  lished to coordinate the harmonization of these activities in Europe. The FESG  had to initiate and assist the intemalization of the supply chains at the levels of  the foods executive, product group, and operating company to ensure that Uni-  lever would gain from European integration. Product differences had to be har-  monized with the diversity in consumer demands; intemational logistical chains  had to be developed for each product category if significant synergistic advan-  tages could be realized, and, if economies of scale existed, a joint facility for  purchasing, production, and distribution had to be planned.  To be able to accomplish these objectives and exploit the existing integration  opportunities, Unilever's management acknowledged that this new sourcing  strategy was inhibited by the administrative diversity among the companies. For  example, to support sourcing studies and to support logistics reconfiguration  projects, distribution data were required. Although distribution data were avail-  able from the operating companies, their information systems varied too much to  link and aggregate this information. Consequently, an information strategy had  to be developed by FESG to manage these new requirements. Besides formulat-  ing compulsory policies on the preferred information systems and connecting the  databases to establish interoperability, common data definitions and information  structures are required for comparison and aggregation of management informa-  tion. Consensus was necessary among Unilever's food companies, and hence the  administrative diversity throughout the corporation needed to be reduced.  Besides observing decreased diversity in the negotiated environment in Eu-  rope and the need to decrease the administrative diversity internally, Unilever  Foods' executive management recognized that the sourcing strategy implied a  major change of its management processes. Many decades of autonomy had  given Unilever's European operating companies a level of independence that  was hard to change. Within the Unilever corporation, an informal type of world-  wide cooperation existed among self-sufficient units (Maljers, 1992). By imple-  menting the FESG and assigning it the task of formalizing some of these  relations and breaking down some of the national companies' autonomy, Uni-  lever challenged its "administrative heritage" (Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1989).  Hence, Unilever's management had to leam to deal with this new situation and  to develop capabilities to coordinate their activities with the other (often foreign)  operating companies, while maintaining their knowledge of the inherited diver-  sity in the various local markets (e.g., customer preferences, business customs).  To assist the organization in this leaming process, the FESG started a commu-  nication and training program at all relevant levels and functions in the company.  Moreover, by creating the appropriate context and by developing management  122 BOONE AND VAN DEN BOSCH (NETHERLANDS)  for their additional tasks, Unilever hoped that its managers would leam how to  cope with these new circumstances. A dynamic process to build unity on diver-  sity took place within Unilever to cope with the changing situation in Europe  (Edelman, 1994).  Discussion  The case study illustrates the managerial problems of the tension between inte-  gration opportunities and constraining diversity in Europe, and the approaches to  these problems. The decreasing diversity in negotiated environments increases  Unilever Foods Europe's integration opportunities. However, the exploitation of  these opportunities is hindered by the administrative diversity in Unilever's Eu-  ropean operating companies. Integration could have had a negative impact on the  competitive advantages of the operating companies if it destroyed their knowl-  edge of the inherited diversity in their local markets. The case study reveals how  these problems are or could be tackled by deliberately changing management  processes aimed at acquiring managerial skills for coping with this tension. The  findings corroborate the conceptual framework. In the course of time, the exter-  nally oriented managerial perspective, followed by the intemally oriented per-  spective, can be discemed. This is also the case with the present and ongoing  interaction between the two processes, in which dynamic managerial capabilities  are being developed. Examples are organizing and managing Europe-wide coor-  dination activities and intracorporate knowledge sharing.  In stressing the importance of both external and intemal perspectives, the  interaction between the two processes involved, and the managerial capabilities,  our framework can be used to support and to contradict Calori and de Woot's  (1994) contribution to the same topic of European management. They based their  "European management model" on insights from Europe's business leaders, and  their model captures the "best practices" shared by top directors and managers of  Europe's biggest companies.  Their model consists of four basic characteristics of a European style of  management: (1) an orientation toward people, (2) intemal negotiation, (3) man-  aging intemational diversity, and (4) managing between extremes. The first char-  acteristic is mainly based on the "social market economy" system in Europe and  can be related to our "inherited diversity" concept and, especially, to the Euro-  pean business systems (see note 1 for a description). The second characteristic  deals primarily with the nature of the social dialogue within firms across Europe  and can also be related to our inherited diversity. Their third characteristic is  more or less related to our first two types of diversity, that is, to diversity in the  negotiated environments and to administrative diversity. Their fourth characteris-  tic positions the Etiropean style of management "in between" the North Ameri-  can and Japanese models."* Our framework differs from theirs, however, in that it  pays more attention to the various forms of diversity from a managerial perspec-  A EUROPEAN STYLE OF MANAGEMENT 123  tive, to the combination of extemally and intemally managerial perspectives, to  the necessity of leaming, and to the development of dynamic managerial capabil-  ities. Moreover, our framework is an attempt to reconcile, at least conceptually,  the tension between integration opportunities and the constraining diversity in  Europe revealed by the literature.  Implications  As we refiect on our conclusion regarding a key characteristic of a European  style of management, we are tempted to investigate the possible implications for  management education and development. However, in view of the lack of a clear  theoretical framework regarding European human-resource management (Forster  and Whipp, 1995, p. 440), we limit ourselves here to three remarks related to our  framework. First, management education can contribute to developing the exter-  nally oriented managerial perspective depicted in the left part of figure 1, includ-  ing the contextual aspects of functional skills. Furthermore, management  education can stimulate an awareness and understanding of the managerial as-  pects of various forms of diversity in Europe by, say, a transnational education.  Traditionally, however, management education is not particularly strong in  teaching cross-fiinctional approaches, as shown in the right side of our frame-  work, and therefore needs further improvement.  Second, management development can contribute to leaming cross-functional  approaches by, for example, job rotation in different European countries. In  particular, having early experience of operating in another country seems to be  important (Goffee and Jones, 1995), as is considering European careers as  "chains of experience" for accumulating managerial knowledge (Peltonen,  1993). Third, and most important, is top management's focus on the need to  develop dynamic managerial capabilities over time throughout the company, to deal  with integration opportunities and remaining diversity in Europe. Management edu-  cation and development in general and acctimulated oractical experience in particu-  lar will contribute to this key characteristic of a European style of management.  Future research  At least three possible directions for fiiture research can be suggested. First, the  central research question investigated here opens up a range of complementary  questions: How are national styles of management in Europe related to a Euro-  pean style of management? Can a similar European style of management be  observed across industries? To what extent can firm-specific advantages be em-  bodied in, for example, technology, scale, or brand names reduce the importance  of context-related managerial skills? Will the "globalization" of industries di-  minish the differences in management styles both at the national and regional  trade-bloc levels?  124 BOONE AND VAN DEN BOSCH (NETHERLANDS)  Second, regarding distinctive managerial capabilities, the following key is-  sues should be addressed: What types of distinctive managerial capabilities are  most important? How are these capabilities related to managerial roles and tasks  and to organizational capabilities? How can these capabilities contribute to the  competitive advantages of firms in Europe, and do they contribute to competitive  advantage in the other regional trade blocs as well? Referring to the above-men-  tioned implications for management education and development, how can busi-  ness schools and European human-resource management contribute to  developing these distinctive managerial capabilities?  Third, regarding the types of case studies needed, longitudinal case studies are  important to understand the leaming processes resulting in dynamic managerial  capabilities of firms in Europe dealing with the observed tension. Case studies  relating these capabilities to dependent variables at different levels of analysis  (e.g., individual, operating company, corporate, national, and industry levels)  seem to be important as well. Such case studies will probably suggest that there  is no such a thing as "the one best approach" to acquiring these capabilities. The  suggested type of case studies can contribute to "cross-level" frameworks (Klein,  Dansereau, and Hall, 1994). These case studies can improve our understanding  of the role of the various contingency factors and provide input for the recent  efforts to develop a contingency model of human-resource management at the  intemational level (Teagarden et al., 1995, p. 1267). Case studies dealing with  questions such as: "Why is managing in the United States so difficult for European  firms?" (Rosenzweig, 1994) or "Is there a U.S. company management style in  Europe?" (Turcq, 1994) are important as well, to determine whether the key charac-  teristic proposed here is really distinctive and whether it contributes to theory  building regarding key characteristics of a European style of management.  Notes  1. Whitley (1992) defines business systems as particular arrangements of hierarchy-  market relations that become institutionalized and relatively successful in particular con-  texts. They consist of three components: (1) the nature of dominant economic agents  controlling economic activities and resources; (2) the structure of market organization;  and (3) the authoritative coordination and control systems within firms. For a different  approach with a focus on underlying philosophical, economic, and social aspects of the  European "businessphere," see Lessem and Neubauer (1994).  2. For an application of the framework to Hewlett-Packard European Customer Sup-  port Centre, see Boone and Van den Bosch (1995).  3. In early 1995, the management structure on the corporate level was also changed  to improve the integration of the food businesses. Instead of one director each for South  Europe and North Europe, Unilever Foods has integrated these two functions into one  director who is responsible for Europe as a whole. Moreover, instead of regional responsi-  bility, more emphasis has been placed on responsibilities for specific product categories.  4. "In between" refers to the relationsliip between the individual and the firm, the  time frame (short term versus long term), and the balance between individualism and a  sense of collectivism in the workplace (Calori and de Woot, 1994, p. 44).

AN EMERGING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF EUROPEAN NATIONS   NOTES ANDVIEWS   European Management:   1 An Emerging   -   CoGJjetitive   Advantage of European   Nations *   FRANS A.J. VAN DEN BOSCH, Professor of Management, Erusmus   ARNO A. VAN PROOIJEN, CEBECO - Handehad, Rotterdam   This article extends the debate begun in the June   1992 issue of EMJ when the authors first criticized   Michael Porter’s explanatory framework in his   Competitive Advantage of Nations (1990), over the   role of national culture on the competitive   advantage of nations. In this paper, Frans van den   Bosch and Arno van Prooijen stress that Europe is a   locus of competitive advantage if one is prepared to   pay attention to the possibility of ‘European   Management’ as a potential asset of European   firms. In this connection, the transnationalization   of European firms is of importance.   * A reply to Michael Porter’s article, EM\, June, 1992.   University, Rotterdam;   Introduction   This article deals with the influence of national culture   on the competitive advantage of European nations and   the possible implications for European Management. In   an earlier contribution (van den Bosch and van Prooijen   1992) we criticized Michael Porter’s explanatory frame-   work in his Competitive Advantage of Nations (1990) with   respect to this subject. We summarize our criticisms and   discuss Porter’s response to our article. His response   contains one somewhat unsatisfactory element, at least   to us. Porter claims that: ‘Europe is not the locus of   competitive advantage’. We elaborate on this view   further by drawing attention to the continuing process   of transnationalization in Europe. We then go on to dis-   cuss the development towards European Management   as an interesting example of transnational management.   The summary and conclusions emphasize the impor-   tance of national culture, as agreed by Michael Porter,   for the competitive advantage of nations. However, con-   trary to Michael Porter, we will stress the importance   of Europe as the locus of competitive advantage due to   the advantages of European Management   National Culture and Competitive   Advantage   Michael Porter’s explanatory framework of analysis of   the Competitive Advantage of Nations consists of four   so-called determinants: (1) factor conditions, (2) demand   conditions, (3) related and supported industries, and (4)   firm strategy, structure and rivalry. Two additional   elements are added to this framework: chance (exogen-   ous influences) and government. This framework forms   a dynamic system of mutually reinforcing determinants   and is called ‘the national diamond’. We criticized   EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL Vol 10 No 4 December 1992 445   AN EMERGING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF EUROPEAN NATIONS   Porter’s framework because it does not explicitly con-   sider the influence of national culture on the competitive   advantage of nations. We made plausible that national   culture works through the determinants and not in   isolation from them and concluded: ‘Therefore we will   not add a fifth determinant to Porters diamond. But we   like to stress the importance of national culture when   explaining the differences in international competitive   advantage. National culture is the base on which the   national diamond rests’ (van den Bosch and van   Prooijen 1992).   In fact, Porter agreed with our conclusion by stating in   his response that we, ‘rightly raise the importance of   cultural factors in setting the context for national   competitive advantages’ (Porter 1992, p. 178). Further-   more he mentioned six additional findings about the role   of culture with respect to competitive advantage. By and   large, we agree with these findings. In our view, one   of these findings deserves special attention: the insight   that ‘cultural factors often lead to sustainable competi-   tive advantage‘. We disagree with Porter’s view that:   ‘Europe is not the locus of competitive advantage’ as   he stated explicitly in his response to our article. If we   are prepared to pay attention to the possibility of   ‘European Management’ as a potential asset of Euro-   pean firms, Europe or the European Community could   become indeed the locus of competitive advantage. In   this connection the transnationalization process of   European firms seems to be of importance.   Transnationalization   In both the International Management and International   Business literature the opportunities and threats of the   management of diversity are an important topic (Buckley   and Brooke 1992). In this connection the gradual   evolution in management thinking with respect to   foreign operations is usually divided into a number of   stages. Recently Bartlett and Ghoshal (1989 and 1992)   propose to add a new stage called ‘transnational’ to the   already existing stages of management thinking like   ‘international’, ‘multinational’ and ‘global’. The gradual   internationalization of the business environment gives   rise to a search for complex mechanisms to coordinate   the differentiated and interdependent units of multi-   national enterprises. In this connection, the trans-   national solution with an integrated network as   organizational structure emerged, according to Bartlett   and Ghoshal. The strength of these integrated networks   springs from their fundamental characteristics: dis-   persed assets, specialized operations, and relationships   between units or divisions of the multinational enter-   prise built on interdependence. However, underlying   this organizational structure is a so called transnational   management mentality: ‘Transnational management   acknowledges the complex, diverse, and changeable   nature of its environment and reflects these charac-   teristics in its organization’s multidimensional perspec-   tives, dispersed capabilities, and flexible process’   (Bartlett 1986, p. 399). In their latest book Bartlett and   Goshal (1992, p. 14) elaborate this view. The trans-   national management mentality recognizes the impor-   tance of different national environments and of flexible   and responsive country-level operations, hence the   return of national into the terminology. Porter’s diamond   model is of great importance for the analysis of the   managerial importance of these different national   environments (van den Bosch and van Prooijen 1992).   The prefix tram stresses the importance of intensive   organization, wide coordination and, due to the inter-   dependence of the units of the MNC, shared decision   making. From this short overview it may be clear that   especially transnational management is suited for taking   seriously cultural diversity among nations. That is why   we propose transnational management as an important   building block for a conceptual model of European   Management.   However, transnationalization of firms in Europe is   more a process than an easy to obtain result. Acquiring,   adapting and implementing the transnational manage-   ment mentality takes time. Van Dijck (1992) stresses   transnationalization as an open process of development   consisting of a number of stages. Ranging from the   initial stage of increasing awareness for and openness   towards the diversity in Europe to the final stage as a   continuing learning process. This learning process   involves searching for and making strategic use of   synergistic possibilities and opportunities of trans-   nationalization in Europe. During all these successive   stages the management of European firms has to be   aware of the fact that national cultures have a major   effect in generating different ‘diamonds’ with respect   to a certain industry for different countries. Trans-   national management acknowledges this fact and seems   thereby to be of special importance for European   Management.   European Management as an   Example of Transnational   Management   Management of diversity, which is fundamental to   European Management, has a strong relationship with   innovation. To stress the importance of Europe’s   cultural divergence and its implications for both   European management and Europe as a locus of com-   petitive advantage, we focus in this paragraph on a very   important driver behind competitive advantage: inno-   vation. Innovation plays a key role as well in the   upgrading of Porter’s diamond aiming at a sustainable   competitive advantage of nations.   Innovation is the generation, acceptance and implemen-   tation of new ideas, processes, products or services   (Moss Kanter 1984, p. 20). It can occur in any part of   a corporation, but just as well may not. Innovation   depends on the conditions that facilitate the creation of   a supportive atmosphere. Moss Kanter (1984, p. 148)   concludes that to produce innovation, more complexity   is essential.

Through wide coordination, intensive organiz-   ation and shared decision making, European Manage-   ment adopting a transnational management approach   creates such a supportive atmosphere for innovation.   This could contribute to Europe as a locus of innovation   and thereby as a locus of competitive advantage. The   currently accelerated European Integration process   could reinforce this development (Thurow 1992).   WC* could illustrate both the gradual development of   transnational management in Europe and the interesting   role of different national environments and in particular   different national cultures as well as its impacts on   innovation by the case of a successful European   company with a real transnational character and an   example of high-tech European cooperation: Airbus   Industrie. The case highlights some behavioural issues   at micro-level; according to Stopford (1986) the most   important subject with respect to improving the   international competitiveness of European industries.   Some twenty years ago Airbus Industrie started as a   consortium of French, German, Spanish and then   British firms. From the beginning Airbus Industrie   sought an edge against US rivals such as Boeing and   MC-Donnell Douglas through superior technology. After   a lot of trouble especially with the various functional   arcas of management, e.g. manufacturing parts in   different countries with final assembly centralized, and   facing the intense internal difficulties of managing such   activities, now Airbus Industrie is a serious threat, in   terms of the growth rate of new orders acquired world-   wide, to its major US rivals (Labrich 1992). This case   illustrates the possibility that European Management   call overcome in time severe managerial difficulties with   respect to the divergence of national cultures and   thtbreby can benefit from increased innovation. This   development could result eventually in ‘Europe as a   locus of competitive advantage’ in certain internationally   oriented industries.   Hofstede (1991, p. 145; p. 229) stresses this point as   wcbll, as he states: ‘The EC can be considered the biggest   laboratory in intercultural cooperation of today’s world’   and: ‘Europe is learning about intercultural cooperation   tht: hard way, but what it has learned will become a   competitive advantage over the other economic super-   pcjwers’. It is interesting to note in this connection that   a ‘federated’ European company, Germany’s Volks-   w,tgen AG, stated: ‘Europe is also the world in   microcosm . . . What works in Europe will equip us to   reach beyond it’ (Advishai 1991, p. 104). These quota-   tions stress the necessity of a transnational management   attitude as well.   Summary and Conclusion   In our reply to Michael Porter’s criticism we have   focused on his view that: ‘Europe is not the locus of   competitive advantage’, because acceptance of this view   has consequences for the quest for European Manage-   ment. We tried to show that the European Community   (or Europe) could become the locus of competitive   advantage, at least in certain internationally oriented   industries. This could be the case if the threat of dif-   ferences of the national environments involved and   especially of the divergence of national cultures can be   transformed into a sustainable European opportunity.   In this connection we propose both transnational   management and Porter’s diamond model as important   building blocks for a conceptual model of European   Management. In that way European Management can   be considered as an emerging competitive advantage of   European nations.

The influence of the large scale mechanization of ware potato growing  upon supply responsiveness in The Netherlands (1955-1978)  F.A.J. VAN DEN BOSCH  Erasmus University, Rotterdam  C.A.P. VEERMAN  Graduate School of Management, Delft  Summary  This article brings together the findings of an investigation into the influence  of large scale mechanization on the supply response of ware potatoes in The  Netherlands (1955-1978).  For this purpose the considered period has been divided into two sub-  periods: the period before the introduction of the mechanization (1955-1965)  and the period within which this mechanization started (1965-1978).  A theoretical supply response model has been developed. The estimation  results of this model with respect to the two sub-periods indicate that mechan-  ization sharply reduced the supply responsiveness. The results did not support  the hypothesis that the gross margin should be preferred to the product price  as an explanatory variable.  1. Introduction  In this paper we will present our findings from a study of the ware potato  market between 1955 and 1978. The principal question we will try to answer  is whether and to what extent the mechanization of ware potato growing that  has taken place during this period has significantly influenced the responsive-  ness of the acreage to changes in revenue from the crop.  For this purpose we have developed a simple supply response model in which  the explanatory variables include the gross margins of the potato crop and of  competing crops. In this connection, another question we have investigated is  whether the acreage response can be better explained empirically by price or  gross margin changes.  Potatoes are one of the last major crops without a regulated market in the  EC. On the one hand this makes it possible to study the behaviour of the  Euro. R. agr.

In order to keep the subject of study as homogeneous as possible we restric-  ted ourselves to the ware potato crop that is grown on one particular sort of  soil: clay.1 Most of the ware potato crop is grown on this type of land and  since The Netherlands is small there is no reason to suppose that differences  of climate will have any significant effect on potato-growing, although clay  ground is not concentrated in one particular geographical area. We have chosen  the aggregate approach to investigate the responsiveness of the acreage to  changes in prices.  In their article, Askari and Cummings (1977) give a survey of the research  that has been undertaken using the Nerlove supply response model. We did  not use this model, in spite of its impressive record, because of the following  objections. Firstly, it is a one product model; other crops are not supposed to  have any direct influence upon the decision about the particular crop. There  have been a lot of attempts to solve this problem by deflating the price of the  particular crop by means of the prices of the other crops. We will try to take  prices of alternative crops directly into consideration, because of the possibility  of farmers being inclined to think in absolute rather than in relative prices.  Secondly, as Hill (1971) has pointed out, Nerlove's model assumes a constant  technology. We will argue in the next section that during the period we are  studying a sort of technological revolution has taken place in potato harvesting  methods. In addition to this we will argue that gross margins are the relevant  variables in the supply response equations and not prices.  Thirdly, there follows from Nerlove's model a specification for the estimator  equation which contains the variable that is to be explained with a lag of one  period. It is very difficult to substantiate the theoretical importance of this  variable. Statistically speaking, the variable only serves as a means of depressing  serial correlation. Therefore, we conclude there is room for an alternative way  of specifying the estimator equation on the basis of a simple acreage decision  model.  In Section 2 we describe the developments in the potato growing sector and  analyse the structural changes that took place. In Section 3 our supply response  model will be outlined and some comments will be made on the way the theor-  etical model has been estimated. The empirical results will be presented and  discussed in Section 4. Section 5 contains our main findings and concluding  remarks.   at Erasm  us U  niversiteit Rotterdam   on January 26, 2012  http://erae.oxfordjournals.org/  D  ow  nloaded from     Large scale mechanization and supply responsiveness 43  2. Developments in the structure of ware potato growing and sales  In this section we will describe and explain the major developments in the  production process. We have noted considerable technological changes in the  production of this crop. We will divide the period under consideration into  two sub-periods. Large scale mechanization did not begin until the second of  these periods. A very rapid growth in new sales openings (exports) occurred  simultaneously with this development. We will explore the consequences of  these changes in the production and sales structure below.  Table 1.

Table 1 shows clearly that the ware potato crop is subject to increases of  scale: more potatoes were grown on a steadily declining number of farms. In  the period 1965-1978 the number of farms was reduced by about 50% while  the mean acreage per farm rose about two and a half times.2  Another interesting point is the trend in the acreage. As can be seen from  Figure 1, from 1955 to 1965 there was a slight downward trend and from 1965  onward a sharp upturn. This is a remarkable phenomenon and one might have  expected technical factors to explain it, such as the decline in the area of agri-  cultural land due to the building of houses, factories and roads, and changes in  the regulations imposed on farmers by the Committee of Plant Pathology in  order to prevent the spread of diseases caused by over-intensive cultivation.  Both factors were in fact operative in the period under consideration, but in  exactly the opposite direction to what one might expect. The area of agri-  cultural land declined by about 25% from 1955 to 1978 and the regulations   at Erasm  us U  niversiteit Rotterdam   on January 26, 2012  http://erae.oxfordjournals.org/  D  ow  nloaded from     44 F.A.J. van den Bosch and C.A.P.

Acreage of ware potatoes grown on clay (excluding seed potatoes).a  In our opinion, the explanation is to be found in changes in the production  process during the sixties. After the War, potato-growing was still very labour-  intensive, especially as regards harvesting. By the end of the sixties the situation  had changed fundamentally; the process had been mechanized practically  throughout. Mechanization is not something which the individual farmer can  introduce gradually, as it involves a chain of mutually dependent machines. If  a farmer wanted to substitute capital for labour it had to be done rigorously.  He had to invest not only in machines, but also in storage capacity, because  the harvest period was drastically shortened and the traditional method of  storage in heaps on the land now became too labour intensive and too depen-  dent upon meteorological factors.2  Because we would like to compare the supply response with and without   at Erasm  us U  niversiteit Rotterdam   on January 26, 2012  http://erae.oxfordjournals.org/  D  ow  nloaded from     Large scale mechanization and supply responsiveness 45  large scale mechanization, we have to divide the period into two sub-periods  as mentioned above. We assume that the mechanization of potato growing  started in the mid-sixties. However, it is very difficult to find adequate data as  far as machines are concerned. This is due to the fact that in general the avail-  able data is not (or cannot be) crop specific. We assume that the mechanization  of potato growing has led to the replacement of old machines with new types.  Table 2 illustrates the replacement process with respect to lifting machines.  Columns (1) and (2) show numbers of labour intensive and labour extensive  lifting machines. It appears that in 1965 the number of machines of the first  type had decreased since 1960, while there had been a rapid increase in labour  extensive machines. As Figure 1 shows, the introduction of mechanization  coincided with the upturn in acreage.  Table 2. Numbers of labour intensive and labour extensive potato crop lifting  machines (1960 = 100).  Year Number of lifting machines (1960= 100)  1960  1965  1970  Labour intensive  (without collection)  (1)  100  62  51  Labour extensive  (with collection in bags, car etc.)  (2)  100  168  199  Source: Agricultural data, Agricultural Economic Institute (1976).  Another way of determining approximately in which years large scale  mechanization began, is to look at the results of this process, namely the  yields of the potato crop. In the period 1955-1964 the average yield was 30  tonnes per hectare and in the succeeding period (1965-1978) 36 tonnes per  hectare. Moreover, the yield was higher than 30 tonnes per hectare every year  in the second period.  The mechanization of potato growing has greatly influenced the flexibility  of the supply response mechanism. The agricultural entrepreneur has freedom  to alter the acreage put down to one crop or another. The other factor, the  physical quantity of the produce, which in the short run determines the total  supply of a crop, is subject to many factors such as the weather and disease.  In his efforts to achieve maximum profits, the farmer only has two instru-   at Erasm  us U  niversiteit Rotterdam   on January 26, 2012  http://erae.oxfordjournals.org/  D  ow  nloaded from     46 F.A.J. van den Bosch and C.A.P. Veerman  ments: minimizing production costs and enlarging the physical quantity. If we  go into the first of the two more deeply (the second is of an entirely different  character), and especially if we focus on the relative part of fixed costs in the  total costs of the crop, it can easily be seen that this particular part has risen  sharply because of the mechanization.4 The only way to depress the fixed  costs per hectare is to enlarge the acreage under cultivation up to the point at  which the available capacity of machinery or of storage is reached, or to the  maximum acreage that can legally be planted. Potato growing demands far  greater investment than other crops. So farmers are inclined to enlarge the  acreage of potatoes because of the pressure of the high fixed costs.  This upward pressure on the acreage would surely have ceased very soon  had it not been possible to export the consequent production surplus, which  was still further enhanced by the rise in physical productivity per hectare due  to technical improvements to the specific crop.5 However, an increase in ex-  ports created a new outlet for sales. To illustrate this development, exports  (measured in tonnes) grew by 200% in the period 1963-1973. Another devel-  opment with respect to the sales structure is the way the crop has been sold.  This point is also important for studying price responsiveness. Although the  percentage of the crop sold on the free market has declined during the period,  more than 50% still finds its way to the customer through this channel.  3. A simple model of the acreage planting decision  In the previous section we dealt with the explanation of the trend line, now  we will focus our attention on the fluctuations around the trend. As we stated  before, the short run decisions with respect to production in agriculture are  those concerning the acreage of the different crops that can be grown on the  particular soil. Physical productivity per hectare is in the short run largely de-  pendent on meteorological factors and in the long run can only be influenced  to a limited extent by technological and chemical improvements to the crop.  Thus farmers can only respond to changing market conditions by altering the  acreages of the various crops.  Let us suppose that a farmer with a total farm acreage at in the crop year t  is able to choose among i (i = 1 . . . . n) crops. We next assume that the costs  of the respective crops consist of variable costs VEj and constant costs CEj,  which are independent of the physical quantity produced per hectare. We  define the expected gross revenue per hectare of culture i (GRj) as the product   at Erasm  us U  niversiteit Rotterdam   on January 26, 2012  http://erae.oxfordjournals.org/  D  ow  nloaded from     Large scale mechanization and supply responsiveness 47  of expected physical quantity from a hectare in kilo's (PQj) of culture i and  the expected price of culture i (Pi). Thus GRj = PQj X Pj. Finally we define  the expected Gross Margin of culture i as: GMj = GRj — VEj.  Now if we take the regulations of the Government with respect to the maxi-  mum acreage of potatoes fixed in order to prevent the spread of diseases we  can formalize them as follows. Let ay be the maximum acreage of culture i in  crop year t; then ay < atii max < at.  Profit maximization means logically the maximization of the sum of the  gross margins of the respective crops. Ranking the gross margins of the respec-  tive crops according to their size logically means that the maximum acreage  permitted must be of the crop with the largest gross margin, and then of the  second largest, and so on.  Formally, if j is the crop with the highest GM:  a tj = a tj max. but ay max. < at  If at — a tj > 0 then the crop with the next highest GM,k is planted:  at,k = at,k max, if at — atj > a^t max.  at,k = a t ~~ a t , j ; if a t — at,j ^ at,k max.  This goes on until:  a t ~~ J ^ J at,i = 0  This means that:  ay = f(GMtj, . . . GMt;l, . . . GMt>n, a y max. . . .  . . . at,i max. . . . at,n max. a t) (1)  We assume that the partial differential quotients have the following values:6   at Erasm  us U  niversiteit Rotterdam   on January 26, 2012  http://erae.oxfordjournals.org/  D  ow  nloaded from     48 F.A.J. van den Bosch and C.A.P. Veerman  The basic model as described by eq. (1) contains gross margins rather than  prices as in many other models. In principle, it seems that the gross margin  should be preferred to the price in supply response equations, especially if the  technology cannot be regarded as constant. For by definition, the gross margin  contains both the price and other relevant information: the results of the  mechanization (the yields) and the consequences for the expenditures which  are relevant in the short run (the variable expenditures).  In principle the supply response has to be estimated by means of a simul-  taneous model. Such a model can be specified in the case of n crops by  deriving (n-1) equations in accordance with eq. (1) and the legal acreage  restrictions. However, if it can be demonstrated that there are no significant  competing crops to the potato for the same soil, it is reasonable to estimate  the supply response by means of a single equation. We will return to this point.  In trying to specify an estimator equation from eq. (2), we have to face a  number of problems. First there is the problem that the economic variables in  eq. (1) represent expectations. We have chosen the simple hypothesis that  expectations are based upon the actual values for the previous two years, with  equal weight being attributed to each of them. The second problem is the  availability of data on the gross margins. There are no separate data on the  gross margins of the different crops. This problem can be solved in two ways.  There is the possibility of substituting the product prices as proxies for the  GM's. We have adopted this solution in our estimation procedures.  To be more specific, we have considered two product prices for potatoes,  one that represents the average product price over the whole harvest year from  August until June (PPY) and one that represents the average product price over  a shorter period from August till February (PPJ). The choice of this variable  may be defended by the argument that most farmers make the planting de-  cision no later than January, by which time most of them have already  bought their seed potatoes. By the end of January most of the potato crop  has been sold (nearly 70%). Other crops, such as wheat, are sown even earlier  — in the autumn.  The other way to overcome the difficulty of lack of data is to estimate the  GM of potatoes separately. Whereas we did all our estimations of the variables  in annual percentage changes7 then proceeded as follows (let the tilde above  every variable denote the percentage change). The equation is true for every  crop:8   at Erasm  us U  niversiteit Rotterdam   on January 26, 2012  http://erae.oxfordjournals.org/  D  ow  nloaded from     Large scale mechanization and supply responsiveness 49  and GMt = PQt • Pt -  so:  GM, = POt • Xo + Pt • K ~ VE t . Xj (2)  To solve the problems caused by lack of data on variable costs we under-  took the following division of these costs into two parts:  VEt = ^ . PGP t_! + Rt  where: a t = quantity of seed potatoes in tonnes per hectare.  PGPt_i = price of seed potatoes per tonne from the previous crop year.  Rt = rest of the variable costs.  The following remarks should be borne in mind. First, the cost of seed  potatoes is the largest cost item (nearly 70%). Second, farmers buy their seed  potatoes from the previous seed potato crop. When we transform this equation  into percentage changes9 we get:  VEt = X2 • PGP t_! +\2 • &t + h • Rt (3)  If, after we have determined the values of Xo, Xl> X-2. ar>d X3, we substitute  this equation into (2) and suppose dt = 0, we get the estimator equation. We  have calculated the average values of Xo and X2 on the basis of the available  data for the period 1971-1976, in the most important regional production  areas (the values of Xi and X3) follow directly from the conditions stated in  Notes 3 and 4 to the present section.  As above calculations for the potato crop reveal, it is very difficult to take  all the GM's of the different crops into consideration in trying to explain  supply response in the potato crop.  In order to get an impression of the relevance of the other crops for potato  supply response, we estimated the influence of gross revenue from the main  competing crops. Cereals (especially wheat) and sugarbeet are the chief alterna-  tive crops in the period under consideration. The following equation gives an  estimate of the influence of these two main competing crops for the first of  the two sub-periods (1955-1964). We necessarily anticipate the empirical  results of our basic model presented in Section 4.   at Erasm  us U  niversiteit Rotterdam   on January 26, 2012  http://erae.oxfordjournals.org/  D  ow  nloaded from     50 F.A.J. van den Bosch and C.A.P.

It appears that gross revenues from sugarbeet (GRS) and wheat (GRW) do  not have a statistically significant coefficient, although the signs are according  to our assumptions (see also the list of symbols under Table 4). We also tried  other modifications of our basic model, but the influence of the competing  crops did not appear significant in any of the estimates with respect to the  first or second sub-periods.  We also tried to corroborate this finding in another way, namely by com-  paring the development of prices paid to the farmer with the yields for the  three main crops: ware potatoes, sugarbeet and wheat. Table 3 presents this  comparison for the two sub-periods. First it appears that the average price and  the yield of the potato crop have the highest percentage change, 60% and 20%  respectively. Second, it appears that the gross revenue10 of the potato crop is  far greater than that of the other crops, although according to the values of  the variation coefficients11 there is more uncertainty about the expected  revenue.

Ingersent (1969) and Revell (1974) found a  significant value for a dummy variable representing the amount of rainfall in  the previous autumn. We have not been successful in trying to prove such a  variable significant in our country, neither were we able to prove Tomek's  (1972) suggestion of a significant mechanisation dummy variable.  4. Empirical results  According to the analysis in Section 2 and 3 the supply response mechanism  has been estimated separately for the first sub-period (1955-1964) before the  large scale mechanization actually started, and for the second sub-period  (1965-1978) in which mechanization did take place. In doing so, we are able  to estimate the influence of mechanization on the supply responsiveness.  The basic equation (1) has been estimated in annual percentage changes,  and we left out the possible competing crops and acreage restriction as was  explained above. We took two variants of the farm gate price: one as the  average of part of the year and the other one as the average of the whole har-  vest year, each with a time lag of one and two years. The results are presented  in Table 4.  It is clear that the results of the model specification that are estimated are in  accordance with the parameter restrictions as specified in the theoretical model.  The signs of the variables all correspond to the theoretical expectations. It is  a remarkable fact that the results, statistically speaking, are better for the first  period than they are for the second. It is also interesting to note the statistically  more adequate results of the price variables in relation to the contructed GM  variables; where the average pre-February price PPJ does slightly better than  PPY.  Furthermore, the suggestion that the memories of the farmers may be short  as manifested by the decreasing relevance of the price variable, which lagged  two years from the first to the second period, is an interesting one. Finally a  considerable decline in the relevance of the price variable as well as the GM  variables may be concluded from these estimations, which is possibly the  empirical support for the points we made in Section 2 when we discussed the  increase in mechanization and the subsequent upward pressure on the acreage   at Erasm  us U  niversiteit Rotterdam   on January 26, 2012  http://erae.oxfordjournals.org/  D  ow  nloaded from     52 F.A.J. van den Bosch and C.A.P.

Concluding remarks  In this study an attempt has been made to investigate the influence of large  scale mechanization upon the supply response of ware potatoes. The basic idea  is that a still continuing mechanization of this crop, meaning rapidly growing  constant costs, leads first to decreasing supply responsiveness and second to an  upward pressure on the supply (acreage). To investigate this, the considered  period was divided into two periods, namely the period before and the period  within which the mechanization started. Several indicators were developed to  justify this division.  A simple theoretical supply response model has been presented, that differs  at several points from the traditional approach. The model contains the gross  margin of the crop concerned and those of the competing crops. Besides all  that, the model shows the influence of acreage restrictions upon the supply  response.  On several grounds it seemed plausible to us that there are no significant  substitutes for the potato crop. This finding justifies the use of a single product  equation. The estimation results of the model with respect to the two sub-  periods lead to the conclusion that mechanization of the potato crop sharply  reduced the supply responsiveness. The price elasticity and the elasticity of the  gross margin with respect to acreage were reduced on average to one fourth  and to half of the values in the period before mechanization. We did not find  evidence to support the conclusion that the gross margin should be preferred  to the product price as an explanatory variable. Our empirical results indicate  decreasing supply responsiveness. An important consequence of this develop-  ment is the reduced possibility of the supply to adapt to changing economic  conditions.  NOTES  1. Ware potatoes grow also on sandy soils. In 1978 the average acreage per farm was less  than a third of that of farms on clay soils.  2. The mean acreage per farm amounted to 1,1 hectares in 1959 and 1,3 hectares in 1963.  3. The average capacity of potato storages per hectare of potato crops increased by 75%  in the period 1963-1968.  4. The yearly average growth rate of the fixed costs per unit of acreage was 3% in the  period 1963-1965, 8% in the period 1966-1970 and 10% in the period 1971-1976.  These figures relate to farms in a major production region.  i   at Erasm  us U  niversiteit Rotterdam   on January 26, 2012  http://erae.oxfordjournals.org/  D  ow  nloaded from     54 F.A.J. van den Bosch and C.A.P.

The partial differential quotients can be equal to zero if, in spite of a rise in the gross  margin, the acreage cannot further increase because of restrictions caused by the  availability of other factors of production.  7. The estimation of the model with the variables transformed in to changes gives the well  known econometric advantages — for example, the elimination of multicollinearity  of the regressors because of an underlying trend in the variable. Besides this, the  estimated model yields values of the respective elasticities directly.  8. PQ,_i . Pt-i VEt_i  Xo = ^T7-^ — ; X ^ r - ^ ; APt.APQt =0andX0-Xi = l.  9. at_i .

Box 1738, 3000 DR Rotterdam, The Netherlands  {jjansen@rsm.nl, fbosch@rsm.nl, hvolberda@rsm.nl}  R  esearch on exploration and exploitation is burgeoning, yet our understanding of the antecedents and con-  sequences of both activities remains rather unclear. We advance the growing body of literature by focusing  on the apparent differences of exploration and exploitation and examining implications for using formal (i.e.,  centralization and formalization) and informal (i.e., connectedness) coordination mechanisms. This study fur-  ther examines how environmental aspects (i.e., dynamism and competitiveness) moderate the effectiveness of  exploratory and exploitative innovation. Results indicate that centralization negatively affects exploratory inno-  vation, whereas formalization positively influences exploitative innovation. Interestingly, connectedness within  units appears to be an important antecedent of both exploratory and exploitative innovation. Furthermore,  our findings reveal that pursuing exploratory innovation is more effective in dynamic environments, whereas  pursuing exploitative innovation is more beneficial to a unit’s financial performance in more competitive envi-  ronments. Through this richer explanation and empirical assessment, we contribute to a greater clarity and better  understanding of how ambidextrous organizations coordinate the development of exploratory and exploitative  innovation in organizational units and successfully respond to multiple environmental conditions.

Boudreau, organizational behavior, performance, strategy, and design; received  October 25, 2004. This paper was with the authors 7 months for 1 revision.  As competition intensifies and the pace of change  accelerates, firms need to renew themselves by ex-  ploiting existing competencies and exploring new  ones (Floyd and Lane 2000). The notion of exploration  and exploitation (March 1991) has emerged as an  underlying theme in research on organizational learn-  ing and strategy (Levinthal and March 1993, Vera and  Crossan 2004), innovation (Danneels 2002, Lee et al.  2003, Rothaermel and Deeds 2004), and entrepreneur-  ship (Shane and Venkataraman 2000). Various litera-  tures have argued that organizations need to become  ambidextrous (Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004, He and  Wong 2004) and develop exploratory and exploita-  tive innovation simultaneously in different organiza-  tional units (e.g., Benner and Tushman 2003, Tushman  and O’Reilly 1996). Units that engage in exploratory  innovation pursue new knowledge and develop new  products and services for emerging customers or mar-  kets. Units pursuing exploitative innovation build on  existing knowledge and extend existing products and  services for existing customers (Benner and Tushman  2003, p. 243). While the importance of pursuing both  types of innovation has often been highlighted, much  more remains to be understood about how ambidex-  trous organizations coordinate the development of  exploratory and exploitative innovation in organiza-  tional units.  First, there is little systematic evidence on whether  units adopt different coordination mechanisms to  develop exploratory and exploitative innovation.  Although previous research has asserted that organiza-  tional antecedents differentially influence exploratory  and exploitative innovation (e.g., Benner and Tushman  2003, Hill and Rothaermel 2003), empirical studies  examining such relationships with radical and incre-  mental types of innovation produced mixed results  (Cardinal 2001, Damanpour 1991, Ettlie et al. 1984,  Dewar and Dutton 1986). Thus, it appears that the  central tenet of units using diverse coordination  mechanisms for exploratory and exploitative inno-  vation remains unproven. The mixed findings may  stem from the fact that previous studies have used  the firm or business unit as a unit of analysis, ignor-  ing the fact that ambidextrous organizations might  differentiate coordination mechanisms at the level  of the organizational unit. Moreover, prior research  has tended to focus on formal hierarchical struc-  ture, thereby ignoring the increasing importance of  informal social relations in coordinating the devel-  opment of exploratory and exploitative innovation  1661  Jansen et al.: Effects of Organizational Antecedents and Environmental Moderators  1662 Management Science 52(11), pp. 1661–1674, © 2006 INFORMS  (Subramaniam and Youndt 2005). Cardinal (2001),  for instance, argued that, in addition to formal con-  trols, informal social relations determine the extent  to which exploratory and exploitative innovation can  be developed, yet the impact of formal hierarchical  structure and informal social relations on exploratory  and exploitative innovation has not been studied  in an integrated model. Focusing on organizational  units, this study contributes to previous research  through examining how formal and informal coordi-  nation mechanisms influence a unit’s exploratory and  exploitative innovation.  Second, a key characteristic of the strategic man-  agement discipline is its emphasis on a firm’s com-  petitive environment. Prior studies have found that  the effectiveness of a strategic orientation (Hambrick  1983, Snow and Hrebiniak 1980), entrepreneurial ori-  entation (Lumpkin and Dess 2001), or innovative-  ness (Zahra 1996, Zahra and Bogner 1999) depends  on environmental aspects. Less well documented  is the contingency perspective that underscores the  effectiveness of a unit’s exploratory and exploita-  tive innovation under different contextual conditions.  Levinthal and March (1993) and Lewin et al. (1999),  for instance, posited that environmental aspects such  as environmental dynamism and competitiveness  moderate the relationship between both types of  innovation and performance. Currently, there is lit-  tle empirical evidence on the nature of this mod-  erating effect and how it affects a unit’s financial  performance. This study examines these effects and  provides a fuller understanding of how organiza-  tions may successfully respond to multiple environ-  mental conditions through pursuing exploratory and  exploitative innovations in organizational units. It  suggests that both types of innovation may lead to  diverse performance outcomes under different con-  textual conditions.  In summary, drawing from theories of organiza-  tional learning and strategic management, this study  asserts that organizational units use different formal  and informal coordination mechanisms to develop  exploratory and exploitative innovations. We advance  the growing body of literature on exploration and  exploitation by focusing on the apparent differences  between the concepts and the implications for using  coordination mechanisms. This study further sug-  gests that the impact of exploratory and exploita-  tive innovation on a unit’s financial performance is  moderated by environmental aspects. Through this  richer explanation and empirical assessment, we con-  tribute to a greater clarity and better understand-  ing of how ambidextrous organizations coordinate the  development of exploratory and exploitative innova-  tion in organizational units and successfully respond  to multiple environmental conditions. In the next  section, we present the literature review and hypothe-  ses. We examine the relationships among organi-  zational antecedents, exploratory and exploitative  innovation, environmental moderators, and financial  performance. After describing our research method,  we present the empirical findings using data on 283  organizational units from 115 autonomous branches  of a large European financial services firm. We con-  clude with a discussion of the results, implications,  and issues for further research.  Literature Review and Hypotheses  Exploratory and Exploitative Innovation  Following previous literatures, we classify innova-  tions along two domains: (1) the proximity to exist-  ing technologies, products, and services, and (2) the  proximity to existing customer or market segments  (Abernathy and Clark 1985, Benner and Tushman  2003, Danneels 2002). Exploratory innovations are  radical innovations and are designed to meet the  needs of emerging customers or markets (Benner and  Tushman 2003, p. 243; Danneels 2002). They offer  new designs, create new markets, and develop new  channels of distribution (Abernathy and Clark 1985).  Exploratory innovations require new knowledge or  departure from existing knowledge (Benner and Tush-  man 2002, Levinthal and March 1993, McGrath 2001).  Conversely, exploitative innovations are incremental  innovations and are designed to meet the needs of  existing customers or markets (Benner and Tushman  2003, p. 243; Danneels 2002). They broaden existing  knowledge and skills, improve established designs,  expand existing products and services, and increase  the efficiency of existing distribution channels (Aber-  nathy and Clark 1985, p. 5). Hence, exploitative inno-  vations build on existing knowledge and reinforce  existing skills, processes, and structures (Abernathy  and Clark 1985, Benner and Tushman 2002, Levinthal  and March 1993, Lewin et al. 1999).  Organizational Antecedents of Exploratory and  Exploitative Innovation  Organizational units use various coordination mech-  anisms to link and integrate different parts of their  unit (Tushman and O’Reilly 1996, Van de Ven 1986).  Coordination mechanisms direct attention and group  together key resources and interdependent functions  needed to develop innovations (Van de Ven 1986).  However, they may differentially influence a unit’s  ability to pursue exploratory and exploitative inno-  vation. Therefore, we examine two generic types of  coordination mechanisms: (1) the formal hierarchical  structure, and (2) informal social relations (cf. Ghoshal  et al. 1994, Tsai 2002).  Jansen et al.: Effects of Organizational Antecedents and Environmental Moderators  Management Science 52(11), pp. 1661–1674, © 2006 INFORMS 1663  Formal Hierarchical Structure. The formal hierar-  chical structure constitutes one of the most impor-  tant ways of coordinating activities. We examine two  main elements of a unit’s hierarchical structure: cen-  tralization and formalization (e.g., Cardinal 2001, Lin  and Germain 2003, Miller and Droge 1986, Zmud  1982). Centralization of decision making reflects the  locus of authority and decision making (Damanpour  1991) and refers to the extent to which decision mak-  ing is concentrated in an organization (Aiken and  Hage 1968). Centralization narrows communication  channels (Cardinal 2001) and reduces the quality and  quantity of ideas and knowledge retrieved for prob-  lem solving (Nord and Tucker 1987, Sheremata 2000).  In addition, it decreases the sense of control over  work and diminishes the likelihood that unit mem-  bers seek innovative and new solutions (Atuahene-  Gima 2003, Damanpour 1991). Because exploratory  innovation requires nonroutine problem solving and  deviation from existing knowledge, centralization of  decision making is likely to reduce exploratory inno-  vation. Conversely, previous research has suggested  that centralized authority is beneficial to speeding up  exploitative innovation (Sheremata 2000). Exploita-  tive innovation is limited in scope and newness, and  generates less uncertainty about requisites for orga-  nizational units (Gopalakrishnan and Damanpour  1994). In this regard, effective decision-making pro-  cesses for pursuing exploitative innovation tend to be  narrowly channeled and more centralized (Cardinal  2001). Centralization of decision authority, therefore,  increases information-processing efficiency and facili-  tates exploitative innovation.  Hypothesis 1. The higher a unit’s centralization of  decision making, (a) the lower its level of exploratory inno-  vation, and (b) the higher its level of exploitative innova-  tion.  Formalization is the degree to which rules, pro-  cedures, instructions, and communications are for-  malized or written down (Khandwalla 1977). The  reliance on rules and procedures hampers experi-  mentation and ad hoc problem-solving efforts (March  and Simon 1958), and reduces the likelihood of indi-  viduals deviating from structured behavior (Weick  1979). Formalization acts as a frame of reference  that constrains exploration efforts and directs atten-  tion toward restricted aspects of the external environ-  ment (Weick 1979). It hinders deviation from existing  knowledge and a unit’s variation-seeking behavior.  Accordingly, formalization constrains exploratory in-  novations. Rather, formalization is generally estab-  lished to respond to environmental phenomena in  a known way (Daft and Lengel 1986, Lyles and  Schwenk 1992). Formalization is aimed at reduc-  ing variance through incremental improvements in  processes and outputs (Benner and Tushman 2003).  Zollo and Winter (2002), for instance, argue that  formalization facilitates the generation of proposals  to improve existing routines. Once changed, these  improved routines become standardized activities  that will be performed for existing sets of customers  (Benner and Tushman 2003). Through formalization,  units codify best practices to make them more effi-  cient to exploit, easier to apply, and to acceler-  ate their implementation (Zander and Kogut 1995).  Thus, formalization enhances exploitative innovations  through improvement of current products, services,  and processes.  Hypothesis 2. The higher a unit’s formalization,  (a) the lower its level of exploratory innovation, and (b) the  higher its level of exploitative innovation.  Informal Social Relations. Informal social rela-  tions concern personal linkages between people and  comprise a more voluntary mode of coordination  than hierarchical structure (Tsai 2002). Although pre-  vious research has shown that interfirm or interunit  relations affect knowledge transfer and learning  (Dhanaraj et al. 2004, Hansen 2002, Uzzi and Lan-  caster 2003), the impact of social relations among  individuals within units on exploratory and exploita-  tive innovation remains unclear. Therefore, our study  examines the structural dimension of social rela-  tions, which concerns the overall pattern of a unit’s  social network in terms of density or connectedness  (Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998, Sheremata 2000, Tsai  and Ghoshal 1998, Uzzi 1997).  Connectedness increases opportunities for informal  hall talk and accessibility to knowledge sources  within organizational units (Jaworski and Kohli 1993).  It helps a range of individuals to combine knowledge  and develop new knowledge underlying exploratory  innovation (Atuahene-Gima 2003, McFadyen and  Cannella 2004). In addition, Subramaniam and  Youndt (2005) argue that social relations assist in  establishing legitimacy and in enabling adoption of  exploratory innovation. Beyond a moderate level,  however, the density of social networks may limit  access to divergent perspectives and to alterna-  tive ways of doing things (Nahapiet and Ghoshal  1998, p. 245). As highly dense networks diffuse  strong norms and establish shared behavioral expec-  tations, they reduce deviant behavior, limit search  scope, and increase selective perception of alterna-  tives (Rowley et al. 2000, Uzzi 1997). Dense social  relations among unit members, therefore, will eventu-  ally constrain departure from existing knowledge and  decrease a unit’s exploratory innovation. Accordingly,  we expect an inverted U-shaped relationship between  connectedness and exploratory innovation. To pursue  Jansen et al.: Effects of Organizational Antecedents and Environmental Moderators  1664 Management Science 52(11), pp. 1661–1674, © 2006 INFORMS  exploitative innovation, on the other hand, organiza-  tional units need to efficiently draw on and refine pre-  vailing knowledge (Subramaniam and Youndt 2005).  Connectedness is advantageous for developing trust  and cooperation among unit members (Adler and  Kwon 2002, Walker et al. 1997). It permits individuals  to develop a deep understanding to further refine and  improve existing products, processes, and markets  (Rowley et al. 2000). Moreover, dense social relations  enable unit members to share experiences with regard  to how to implement certain improvements (Dyer  and Nobeoka 2000). Connectedness within organiza-  tional units, therefore, facilitates improving existing  knowledge resources and increases a unit’s exploita-  tive innovation.  Hypothesis 3. (a) There will be an inverted U-shaped  relationship between a unit’s connectedness among its  members and the level of exploratory innovation. (b) The  higher a unit’s connectedness among its members, the  higher its level of exploitative innovation.  The Moderating Role of External Environment on  the Effectiveness of Exploratory and Exploitative  Innovations  The impact of the external environment on innova-  tiveness and performance has been widely acknowl-  edged (e.g., Zahra 1996, Zahra and Bogner 1999).  Miller and Friesen (1983), for instance, found that  environmental aspects moderate the relationship  between innovation and performance. Regarding  exploratory and exploitative innovations, previous lit-  eratures argued that environmental dynamism and  competitiveness are likely to moderate the impact of  both types of innovations on performance (Levinthal  and March 1993, Lewin et al. 1999).  Environmental dynamism refers to the rate of change  and the degree of instability of the environment  (Dess and Beard 1984). Previous research not only  reflects environmental dynamism through the amount  of change, but also through the unpredictability  of change (cf. Dess and Beard 1984). Dynamic  environments may be characterized by changes in  technologies, variations in customer preferences, and  fluctuations in product demand or supply of mate-  rials. Dynamic environments make current products  and services obsolete and require that new ones be  developed (Jansen et al. 2005, Sorensen and Stuart  2000). To minimize this threat of obsolescence, orga-  nizational units need to introduce exploratory inno-  vations that depart from existing products, services,  and markets. Organizational units that pursue such  innovations can capitalize on changing circumstances  by creating new products and services or meeting the  needs of emerging markets (Zahra 1996). They cre-  ate opportunities for above-normal return by target-  ing premium market segments (Levinthal and March  1993, Zahra and Bogner 1999) and creating new  niches (Lumpkin and Dess 2001). Hence, in dynamic  environments, we expect organizational units that  are pursuing exploratory innovations to increase  their financial performance. Conversely, organiza-  tional units that pursue exploitative innovations are  likely to decrease their performance. Such organiza-  tional units are inclined to exploit existing products,  services, and markets. They are likely to fall behind  because they become consistently better at perform-  ing routines that are less and less valued by the envi-  ronment (Sorensen and Stuart 2000). Accordingly,  Hypothesis 4. Environmental dynamism (a) positively  moderates the relationship between exploratory innovation  and financial performance, and (b) negatively moderates the  relationship between exploitative innovation and financial  performance.  Environmental competitiveness is the extent to which  external environments are characterized by intense  competition (Matusik and Hill 1998). It refers to  the degree of competition reflected in the number  of competitors and the number of areas in which  there is competition (Miller 1987). Competitive envi-  ronments have been associated with intensive pres-  sures for higher efficiency and lower prices (Matusik  and Hill 1998) that lead to tighter margins and less  organizational slack (Zahra 1996). Miller and Friesen  (1983, p. 223) argue that extensive risk taking, forceful  proactiveness, and strong emphasis on novelty (i.e.,  exploratory innovation) can be hazardous when com-  petitive conditions become more demanding. Out-  comes of exploratory innovations tend to rapidly  become diffused over the population of competi-  tors (Levinthal and March 1993). Moreover, envi-  ronmental competitiveness usually reduces available  resources for exploratory innovations (Miller and  Friesen 1983, Zahra 1996), and pursuing such high-  risk and high-cost innovations would considerably  harm the viability of organizational units (Zahra  and Bogner 1999). We therefore propose that envi-  ronmental competitiveness negatively moderates the  effectiveness of exploratory innovations. Conversely,  organizational units reacting to existing trends and  demands through modifying or expanding current  products, services, and markets (i.e., exploitative  innovation) are likely to enhance their performance  in competitive environments (Lumpkin and Dess  2001). They pursue exploitative innovations to bet-  ter cater to existing customers and build customer  loyalty without substantial costs associated with  exploratory innovations. Through increased advertis-  ing and enhanced tailoring of existing products and  services (Miller 1987), these organizational units try  to charge a premium and capture additional market  share (Zahra and Bogner 1999). Accordingly, orga-  nizational units pursuing exploitative innovation in  Jansen et al.: Effects of Organizational Antecedents and Environmental Moderators  Management Science 52(11), pp. 1661–1674, © 2006 INFORMS 1665  competitive environments are likely to increase their  financial performance.  Hypothesis 5. Environmental competitiveness (a) neg-  atively moderates the relationship between exploratory  innovation and financial performance, and (b) positively  moderates the relationship between exploitative innovation  and financial performance.  Method  Setting and Data Collection  The empirical research was conducted at a large Euro-  pean financial services firm. The financial services sec-  tor is an interesting case for innovation researchers  because it has been confronted with the blurring of  industry boundaries and with new entrants from,  among others, the retail and telecom industries (Flier  et al. 2003). These changes have triggered incumbent  financial services firms to pursue several exploratory  and exploitative innovations, such as the introduction  of ATMs, Internet banking, and mobile banking (Han  et al. 1998, Pennings and Harianto 1992). The firm  has total assets of more than $350 billion and ranks  among the top 30 on the Fortune Global 500 in terms  of total revenue in the banking industry. It is a broad-  based financial service provider with branches in  various countries. These branches are geographically  distinct, autonomous decision entities, each with its  own board of directors. The branches have autonomy  with respect to types of products and services offered  and markets within which to provide these products  and services. Organizational units in these branches  provide products and services that cover asset man-  agement, mortgages, loans and savings, insurance,  leasing, equity participation, corporate banking, and  investment banking. Each organizational unit has  its own management team with budget responsi-  bilities regarding several aspects of its operations,  such as pursuing exploratory and exploitative innova-  tion. Moreover, organizational units within branches  operate in markets with varying levels of environ-  mental dynamism and competitiveness—a condition  required to observe units pursuing different innova-  tive activities (Han et al. 1998).  To deal with potential problems associated with  single-informant bias and common-method bias, we  temporarily separated the measurement of indepen-  dent and dependent variables and collected data at  two different points in time. In 2002, a survey assess-  ing centralization, formalization, and connectedness  was administered to the general manager of 769 orga-  nizational units within 220 branches in one coun-  try. To ensure confidentiality, we agreed not to reveal  the name of the manager and asked each manager  to return the questionnaire directly to the research  team. Unit managers from 462 organizational units  returned their questionnaire, representing a response  rate of 60%. In 2003, approximately 10 months after  the first survey, a second survey was mailed to the  same 462 organizational unit managers to assess their  unit’s exploratory innovation, exploitative innovation,  environmental dynamism, and competitiveness. We  received 283 surveys from organizational units in 115  branches, representing a final response rate of 36.8%.  The respondents of these 283 organizational units had  a mean company tenure of 7.85 years (s.d. = 8 24).  The average size of the organizational units was 33.37  (s.d.= 20 79) full-time employees.  To test for nonresponse bias, we examined differ-  ences between respondents and nonrespondents for  our final sample. T -tests showed no significant dif-  ferences based on the number of full-time employees  of organizational units and their associated branches,  total assets of branches, and units’ prior performance.  We also compared early and late respondents in terms  of demographic characteristics and model variables.  These comparisons did not reveal any significant dif-  ferences  p < 0 05 , indicating that nonresponse bias  was not a problem.  To examine reliability issues associated with single-  informant data, we surveyed two additional members  of the 283 responding organizational units in 2003.  Both management team members and senior employ-  ees of organizational units were asked to partici-  pate and to assess their unit’s exploratory innovation,  exploitative innovation, environmental dynamism,  and environmental competitiveness. This follow-up  survey resulted in 79 responses from 56 organiza-  tional units, or 19.8% of the organizational units from  the final sample that were comparable in size, age,  and prior performance to our final sample. We cal-  culated an interrater agreement score  r  wg    for data  on these variables (James et al. 1993). The median  interrater agreements were 0.74, 0.78, 0.91, and 0.89,  respectively, for exploratory innovation, exploitative  innovation, environmental dynamism, and environ-  mental competitiveness, suggesting adequate agree-  ment. Intraclass correlations revealed a strong level  of interrater reliability: Correlations were consistently  significant at the 0.001 levels (Jones et al. 1983).  Measurement and Validation of Constructs  This study used existing scales from the literature,  but appropriate scales for exploratory and exploita-  tive innovation were not available. Therefore, we  reviewed relevant literature and generated a pool of  items to tap the domain of each construct. Next, to  enhance the construct validity of the survey mea-  sures, we conducted a pretest involving in-depth pilot  interviews with 15 managers with various tenures at  different branches. The managers were asked to com-  plete the questionnaire and to indicate any phrasing  Jansen et al.: Effects of Organizational Antecedents and Environmental Moderators  1666 Management Science 52(11), pp. 1661–1674, © 2006 INFORMS  of the items that they thought was ambiguous. Dur-  ing follow-up interviews, managers were invited to  provide suggestions for improvement of the question-  naire. After this pretest, the phrasing of items was  further enhanced by the authors and peers, resulting  in the final version. The appendix provides all items  of study variables.  Dependent Variables. Financial performance of or-  ganizational units was measured through internal  corporate records by a unit’s average profitability  from 2003 up to one year after the measurement  of exploratory and exploitative innovation. Because  organizational units may have different strategic pri-  orities, we adjusted financial performance data to  evaluate each organizational unit. Following Tsai  (2001), we used a unit’s profitability-achieved rate,  which is a unit’s profitability divided by its target  profitability. We ascertained a unit’s profitability as  well as target profitability through internal corporate  records. We averaged the profitability-achieved rate  over a one-year period to help guard against random  fluctuations in the data.  To develop measures for exploratory and exploita-  tive innovation, we generated items on a seven-point  scale by carefully examining existing literature (Aber-  nathy and Clark 1985, Benner and Tushman 2003,  Lewin et al. 1999, March 1991, Uzzi and Lancaster  2003) and analyzing interviews with managers at  branches of the financial services firm. The resulting  six-item measure for exploratory innovation    = 0 86   captured the extent to which units depart from exist-  ing knowledge and pursue innovations for emerging  customers or markets. In the context of financial ser-  vices, exploratory innovation is related to develop-  ing new products and services such as fundamentally  new loan structures and contingent contracts not pre-  viously provided by organizational units (Uzzi and  Lancaster 2003). The measure for exploitative innova-  tion    = 0 80  captured the extent to which units  build on existing knowledge and meet the needs of  existing customers (Abernathy and Clark 1985, Ben-  ner and Tushman 2003, Danneels 2002). Prior research  on financial services has related exploitative inno-  vation to aggressive lending, shopping the market,  and increasing efficiency (e.g., Uzzi and Lancaster  2003). To further examine reliability and ensure valid-  ity of our measures for exploratory and exploitative  innovation, we measured both types of innovation at  the branch level through surveying managing direc-  tors from our sample of branches in 2003. A total  of 110 questionnaires were completed and returned.  First, alpha reliabilities of exploratory and exploitative  innovations in the sample of managing directors  were 0.86 and 0.77, respectively, revealing strong  reliability of both measures. Second, we conducted  exploratory factor analysis of the 12 items pertaining  to exploratory and exploitative innovation. Results  revealed a two-factor solution with significant factor  loadings above 0.58 and cross-loadings below 0.29,  indicating convergent and discriminant validity of  both measures in the sample of managing directors.  Third, correlations between exploratory and exploita-  tive innovation at the branch level and the average  level of both types of innovations among organiza-  tional units within the same branch were positive  and significant  p < 0 01 . These findings provided  strong support for the reliability and validity of our  two measurements for exploratory and exploitative  innovation.  Independent and Moderating Variables. We used  the subconstruct of hierarchy of authority (Hage and  Aiken 1967) to measure centralization of decision mak-  ing    = 0 71 . As Dewar et al. (1980) indicate, the  scale is found to be both reliable and valid. To mea-  sure formalization, we used a five-item formalization  scale   = 0 74  from Desphandé and Zaltman (1982).  Connectedness    = 0 78  was measured with a five-  item scale adapted from Jaworski and Kohli (1993).  They developed a scale for connectedness that mea-  sured the extent to which employees were networked  to various levels of the hierarchy in their organiza-  tional unit. Based on previous literatures, a five-item  measure was included that captured environmental  dynamism (cf. Dill 1958, Volberda and Van Bruggen  1997). The scale for environmental dynamism   = 0 87   tapped into the rate of change and the instability of  the external environment. A four-item scale was used  for environmental competitiveness    = 0 86  that mea-  sured the extent to which a unit’s external environ-  ment is characterized by intense competition that is  reflected in the number of competitors and the num-  ber of areas in which there is competition (Birkinshaw  et al. 1998, Jaworski and Kohli 1993).  We assessed the construct validity of all items per-  taining to our constructs through exploratory and  confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Exploratory fac-  tor analysis of all items (dependent variables, inde-  pendent variables, and moderating variables) clearly  replicated the intended seven-factor structure. Each  item loaded clearly on its intended factor (all factor  loadings were above 0.61 with cross-loadings below  0.34), and all factors had eigenvalues greater than one,  supporting the seven-factor solution. An integrated  CFA on all items (with each item constrained to load  only on the factor for which it was the proposed  indicator) yielded a model that fits the data well  (   2  /df = 2 20, goodness-of-fit index (GFI)= 0 92, com-  parative fit index (CFI)= 0 91, and root-mean-square  error of approximation (RMSEA)= 0 056 . Item load-  ings were as proposed and significant  p < 0 01 . To  Jansen et al.: Effects of Organizational Antecedents and Environmental Moderators  Management Science 52(11), pp. 1661–1674, © 2006 INFORMS 1667  examine discriminant validity, we also assessed two-  factor models for each pair. Constraining each correla-  tion in the second model to unity and examining the  difference in chi-square values, we found significant  test statistics  p < 0 001  for each pair. Accordingly,  the measurements used in our study are not only the-  oretically, but also empirically distinguishable.  Control Variables. In the empirical study, we con-  trolled for possible confounding effects by includ-  ing various relevant control variables. Because larger  units may have more resources yet may lack the flex-  ibility to explore, we included the natural logarithm  of the number of full-time employees within units  to account for unit size. Organizational units situ-  ated in large branches may also have access to avail-  able branch resources that can be used to develop  exploratory and exploitative innovation (Gooding  and Wagner 1985). Accordingly, we included branch  size as the natural logarithm of the number of full-  time employees within a branch. A unit’s age, mea-  sured by the number of years from its founding,  was also included. Previous studies have shown that  older units may have increased cumulative experi-  ence that enhances innovation; however, they may  also encounter problems in keeping abreast of exter-  nal developments (Sorensen and Stuart 2000). The  number of functional areas represented in a unit is ben-  eficial to considering a greater range of perspectives  and to facilitating creativity (Milliken and Martins  1996, Moorman and Miner 1997), yet functional diver-  sity may create difficulties in resolving differences  among perspectives and may slow down exploita-  tive innovation. We therefore controlled for functional  diversity measured as the number of functional areas  Table 1 Means, Standard Deviations, and Correlations  Mean St. dev.

To control for the effect that units may special-  ize in different markets and have different ranges of  products and services, we included unit client focus  that indicates whether the unit provided products and  services for private clients (coded as 0) or for busi-  ness clients (coded as 1). Organizational units with a  strong history of high performance are likely to invest  in innovation. Hence, we included a unit’s past perfor-  mance measurements. Because units may have differ-  ent strategic priorities, we adjusted performance data  to evaluate each unit. Following Tsai (2001), we used  a unit’s profitability-achieved rate (a unit’s profitabil-  ity divided by its target profitability). We also con-  trolled for a branch’s past performance and included a  branch’s profitability-achieved rate (a branch’s return  on investment divided by its target return). The past  performance measurements as well as the achieved  rates for the units and branches in this study for the  period 2000–2002 were ascertained through internal  corporate records.  Analysis and Results  Table 1 presents descriptive statistics and correlations  for the study variables. Table 2 presents the results  of the hierarchical regression analyses for exploratory  innovation, exploitative innovation, and financial per-  formance. Prior to the creation of the interaction terms  in Model 6 (Table 2), we mean centered the inde-  pendent variables to reduce multicollinearity (Aiken  and West 1991). Moreover, to examine multicollinear-  ity, we calculated variance inflation factors (VIF) for  each of the regression equations. The maximum VIF  within the models was 1.44, which is well below the  rule-of-thumb cut-off of 10 (Neter et al. 1990).

Models 2 and 4 introduce orga-  nizational antecedents of a unit’s exploratory and  exploitative innovation, and Model 6 examines mod-  erating effects of environmental dynamism and com-  petitiveness on a unit’s financial performance.  Regarding the effects of centralization of decision  making on exploratory and exploitative innovation,  Model 2 shows that the coefficient for exploratory  innovation is negative and significant (  = −0 17,  p < 0 01). Hypothesis 1(a) is supported. Model 4  shows that the coefficient for exploitative innovation  is positive but not significant (  = 0 04, ns), thus  not supporting Hypothesis 1(b). Although central-  ization decreases the ability of organizational units  to pursue exploratory innovation, it does not sup-  port a unit’s exploitative innovations as predicted.  Regarding formalization, results in Model 2 show that  formalization does not decrease a unit’s exploratory  innovation. Although the coefficient is negative, it is  not significant ( =−0 07, ns), thereby not supporting  Hypothesis 2(a). Hypothesis 2(b) that proposed a pos-  itive relationship between formalization and a unit’s  exploitative innovation is supported (  = 0 18, p <  0 01). Thus, our findings indicate that formalization  enhances a unit’s ability to pursue exploitative inno-  vation. Regarding social relations in organizational  units, we predicted an inverted U-shaped relationship  between connectedness and exploratory innovation.  As shown in Model 2, the coefficient for connected-  ness is positive and significant (  = 0 20, p < 0 01).  However, the coefficient for the squared term is nega-  tive and not significant ( =−0 08, p > 0 10). Accord-  ingly, the relationship between connectedness and  exploratory innovation is positive rather than curvi-  linear, thereby not supporting Hypothesis 3(a). As  shown in Model 4, the coefficient for connectedness  and exploitative innovation is positive and signifi-  cant ( = 0 21, p < 0 01), supporting Hypothesis 3(b).  Overall, these findings suggest that densely connected  social relations within organizational units positively  influence the ability to develop exploratory innova-  tion as well as exploitative innovation.  Regarding the moderating effect of environmental  dynamism,Model 6 shows that the interaction between  exploratory innovation and environmental dynamism  is positive and significant (  = 0 15, p < 0 01).  Hypothesis 4(a) is supported. To plot this interaction,  exploratory innovation and environmental dynamism  took the values of one standard deviation below (i.e.,  Jansen et al.: Effects of Organizational Antecedents and Environmental Moderators  Management Science 52(11), pp. 1661–1674, © 2006 INFORMS 1669  Figure 1 The Moderating Effect of Environmental Dynamism  92  94  96  98  100  102  104  106  108  110  Low High  Exploratory innovation  Fi  rm   p  er  fo  rm  an  ce  Low environmental dynamism  High environmental dynamism  low level) and above (i.e., high level) the mean. The  plot of the interaction is shown in Figure 1. Consistent  with Hypothesis 4(a), Figure 1 shows a positive rela-  tionship between exploratory innovation and finan-  cial performance when environmental dynamism is  high. Moreover, it also reveals that organizational  units pursuing exploratory innovation in stable envi-  ronments (i.e., low level of environmental dynamism)  decrease their financial performance. As shown in  Model 6, the coefficient for the interaction between  exploitative innovation and environmental dynamism  is negative and significant (  = −0 23, p < 0 001) as  proposed by Hypothesis 4(b). Consistently, the plot  of this interaction in Figure 2 shows a negative rela-  tionship between exploitative innovation and finan-  cial performance when environmental dynamism is  high. Moreover, this figure also suggests that the more  organizational units pursue exploitative innovation in  stable environments (i.e., low level of environmental  dynamism), the more they increase their financial per-  formance.

Although the coefficient is nega-  tive, it is not significant, thus, Hypothesis 5(a) is  not supported. As predicted by Hypothesis 5(b), the  interaction effect between exploitative innovation and  environmental competitiveness is positive and signifi-  cant ( = 0 19, p < 0 001). Thus, as plotted in Figure 3,  organizational units pursuing exploitative innovation  in highly competitive environments increase their  financial performance.  Discussion and Conclusion  Research on exploration and exploitation is bur-  geoning, yet our understanding of the antecedents  and consequences of both activities remains rather  unclear. Although prior research has suggested  that organizational antecedents differentially affect  exploratory and exploitative innovations, empirical  examinations have produced mixed results. Moreover,  empirical studies have only started exploring the  moderating role of the external environment on the  effectiveness of exploratory and exploitative innova-  tion. Focusing on organizational units, the objective of  this study was to explore how organizations coordi-  nate the development of exploratory and exploitative  innovation in organizational units and successfully  respond to multiple environmental conditions.  Our study underscores previous conceptual asser-  tions that formal hierarchical structure, i.e., central-  ization and formalization, differentially influences  exploratory and exploitative innovation (e.g., Benner  and Tushman 2003). Centralization has been stud-  ied widely in innovation literatures and is supposed  to negatively influence innovativeness (e.g., Daman-  pour 1991), however, the relationship between cen-  tralization of decision making and different types  Jansen et al.: Effects of Organizational Antecedents and Environmental Moderators  1670 Management Science 52(11), pp. 1661–1674, © 2006 INFORMS  of innovation remains rather unclear (Cardinal 2001,  Damanpour 1991, Dewar and Dutton 1986). Our  findings demonstrate that centralization negatively  influences a unit’s exploratory innovation. Accord-  ingly, it reduces nonroutine problem solving and  the likelihood that unit members seek innova-  tive and new exploratory solutions (Atuahene-Gima  2003). Although centralization negatively influences  exploratory innovation, it does not support exploita-  tive innovation as predicted. Whereas Cardinal’s  (2001) research in the pharmaceutical industry  revealed that centralization facilitated drug enhance-  ment through exploitation of knowledge sources,  our study found no support for such a hypothe-  sized positive effect of centralization. A possible ex-  planation for the insignificant relationship between  centralization and exploitative innovation could be  that in our research context—the financial services  industry—decentralization of decision authority may  be required to execute tasks and initiate ideas for  improving existing products and services or enhanc-  ing customer service quality (Kirkman and Rosen  1999). To fully understand this relationship, future  research may examine whether additional characteris-  tics of innovations activities, such as uncertainty (Car-  dinal 2001), vary across industries and moderate the  relationship between centralization and exploitative  innovation.  With regard to formalization, we found a pos-  itive relationship between the extent of rules and  procedures within organizational units and exploita-  tive innovation. This observation reinforces the notion  that rules and procedures are established to incre-  mentally improve processes and outputs (Benner and  Tushman 2003, Daft and Lengel 1986). Formaliza-  tion makes existing knowledge and skills explicit and  accelerates the diffusion of best practices within units  (Zander and Kogut 1995). Regarding exploratory  innovation, our findings did not provide support for  the predicted negative effect of formalization on a  unit’s exploratory innovation. In this way, our study  bears similarities with recent insights that rules and  procedures might not be as detrimental to explo-  ration efforts as previously assumed. Adler and Borys  (1996), for instance, argue that well-designed rules  and procedures enable employees to better mas-  ter their tasks and functions. Moreover, codification  efforts of newly developed knowledge in written  rules and procedures might help units to facilitate the  replication and diffusion of an exploratory innovation  (Zollo and Winter 2002). In this sense, formalization  does not simply produce inertial forces and a focus  toward exploitation (e.g., Cardinal 2001), although its  effect is contingent on its design and its ability to  produce an enabling rather than a coercive bureau-  cracy (Adler and Borys 1996).  Our findings reveal that dense social relations  within units are an effective coordination mechanism  that yields multiple benefits. First, connectedness  shows a significant positive effect on both exploratory  and exploitative innovation. These results highlight  the importance of social relations manifested in orga-  nizational units to pursue both exploratory and  exploitative innovation. Subramanian and Youndt  (2005), for instance, found that a firm’s social capi-  tal enables its capability to develop incremental and  radical innovations. Our results suggest that man-  agers may develop densely connected social rela-  tions within their units to increase a unit’s contextual  ambidexterity, i.e., its ability to simultaneously pur-  sue both types of innovations (Gibson and Birkinshaw  2004). Second, a comparison of the full model with  restricted models containing either formal or informal  coordination mechanisms (cf., Hansen and Wernerfelt  1989, Kotha and Nair 1995) also shows that infor-  mal coordination mechanisms (i.e., connectedness)  are more important than formal coordination mecha-  nisms (centralization and formalization) in predicting  both types of innovation. Accordingly, our study indi-  cates that informal coordination mechanisms not only  contribute to pursuing exploratory and exploitative  innovations, but are also more important than for-  mal coordination mechanisms for developing either  exploratory or exploitative innovation.  Prior research has argued that the nature of the  external environment has an important role in the  effectiveness of types of innovation (Zahra 1996,  Zahra and Bogner 1999). Our findings provide sub-  stantial support for such environmental moderators.  They provide various managerial implications regard-  ing how organizational units successfully cope with  various pressures from external environments. Specif-  ically, results suggest that organizational units oper-  ating in more dynamic environments increase their  financial performance by pursuing exploratory inno-  vations. They resist the threat of obsolescence of  their competences not only by developing new prod-  ucts and services (e.g., Zahra and Bogner 1999), but  also by entering new markets and finding new cus-  tomers. On the other hand, efforts of organizational  units to respond to environmental changes through  exploitation of existing products, services, and mar-  kets appear to have a negative effect on financial  performance. These organizational units fall behind  as they try to improve and extend existing products  and services for markets that are in decline (Leonard-  Barton 1992, Levinthal and March 1993, Sorensen and  Stuart 2000). Hence, the empirical findings contribute  to previous literatures by revealing that environmen-  tal dynamism differentially moderates the effective-  ness of exploratory and exploitative innovations.  Jansen et al.: Effects of Organizational Antecedents and Environmental Moderators  Management Science 52(11), pp. 1661–1674, © 2006 INFORMS 1671  Contrary to our prediction, pursuing exploratory  innovations in competitive environments does not sig-  nificantly decrease financial performance. Although  exploratory innovations decrease a unit’s slack (Zahra  1996), they may establish new ways of generating  above-normal returns. A possible explanation for the  deviant finding could be that duration of environmen-  tal competitiveness plays a role. During long-term  competitive rivalry, for instance, organizational units  may find themselves trapped in endless improve-  ment of existing products, services, and processes  (Levinthal and March 1993). The only way to refrain  from decreasing margins may be to develop radi-  cally new products and services for emerging markets  or customers. Thus, although pursuing exploratory  innovations might be detrimental, on average, dur-  ing short periods of competitive rivalry, it might  be the only way to establish new markets dur-  ing long periods of competitive rivalry (Levinthal  and March 1993). To further investigate the moder-  ating role of environmental competitiveness, future  research should include a measurement of the dura-  tion of environmental competitiveness. As predicted,  empirical results show that organizational units that  pursue exploitative innovations in highly competi-  tive environments improve their performance. Hence,  units are able to successfully operate in highly com-  petitive environments by expanding current products  and services and defending existing markets through  increasing customer loyalty.  Limitations and Future Research Directions  Various limitations, which provide meaningful direc-  tions for future research, merit discussion. First,  although the collection of performance data through  internal corporate records and the temporary sepa-  ration of the independent and dependent measures  provide valuable methodological contributions, the  issues of common method bias and unobserved het-  erogeneity cannot be totally ruled out. However,  the inclusion of several relevant control variables,  Harman’s one-factor analysis, and the differential  effects of study variables found on both types of inno-  vation reduced our concerns. Nevertheless, future  research may consider a longitudinal research design  to better assess how organizational antecedents affect  exploratory and exploitative innovation over time.  Second, new scales for exploratory and exploitative  innovation were developed. Although we conducted  several additional analyses to assess the validity of  these measurements, it would be useful to measure  both types of innovation using complementary mea-  surements and relate these to our measurements.  Future research may also provide a more-detailed  examination of organizational antecedents as well  as outcomes of new-to-unit versus new-to-market  innovations.  Third, because our study focuses on the structural  dimension of social networks, future research may  examine the impact of the relational dimension of  social networks. Relational embeddedness, or the  strength of social relations between unit members,  has been shown to increase the exchange of knowl-  edge (Dhanaraj et al. 2004, Hansen 2002), which might  impact the ability of units to pursue exploratory and  exploitative innovations.  Fourth, our survey research was conducted at mul-  tiple organizational units in autonomous branches of  a large financial services firm. Our focus helped to  control for corporate-, industry- and country-specific  differences that might have otherwise masked signif-  icant effects. Empirical studies in a wider variety of  organizations within nonservice industries are neces-  sary to generalize the findings further.  Fifth, our empirical study included performance  data up to one year after the measurement of ex-  ploratory and exploitative innovations. Future stud-  ies may benefit from gathering performance data  that span more than one year. Moreover, it would  enable analyzing performance implications at differ-  ent points in time to contrast the effects of exploratory  and exploitative innovations. Future studies may also  examine other dimensions of a unit’s performance,  such as sales growth and market share.  Sixth, although our study provides new insights  into organizational antecedents and consequences of  exploratory and exploitative innovation, it does not  address how unit managers are triggered to change  levels of exploratory and exploitative innovation. It  would be useful to conduct in-depth studies to better  understand how change efforts initiate.  All in all, our study highlights various theoret-  ical and managerial implications through provid-  ing new insights into levers for increasing levels of  exploratory and exploitative innovation. In response  to the plea for developing and synchronizing both  types of innovation, our study not only examines  how ambidextrous organizations might successfully  coordinate exploratory and exploitative innovation in  organizational units, but also reveals under which  environmental conditions both are effective.

Measures and Items at the  Organizational Unit Level  ∗  Exploratory innovation  Our unit accepts demands that go beyond existing prod-  ucts and services.  We invent new products and services.  We experiment with new products and services in our  local market.  We commercialize products and services that are com-  pletely new to our unit.  We frequently utilize new opportunities in new markets.  Our unit regularly uses new distribution channels.  We regularly search for and approach new clients in new  markets.  ∗∗  Exploitative innovation  We frequently refine the provision of existing products  and services.  We regularly implement small adaptations to existing  products and services.  We introduce improved, but existing products and ser-  vices for our local market.  We improve our provision’s efficiency of products and  services.  We increase economies of scales in existing markets.  Our unit expands services for existing clients.  Lowering costs of internal processes is an important  objective.  ∗∗  Centralization of decision making  (Hage and Aiken 1967, Dewar et al. 1980)  There can be little action taken here until a supervisor  approves a decision.  A person who wants to make his own decisions would  be quickly discouraged.  Even small matters have to be referred to someone higher  up for a final decision.  Unit members need to ask their supervisor before they  do almost anything.  Most decisions people make here have to have their  supervisor’s approval.  Formalization  (Desphande and Zaltman 1982)  Whatever situation arises, written procedures are avail-  able for dealing with it.  Rules and procedures occupy a central place in the orga-  nizational unit.  Written records are kept of everyone’s performance.  Employees in our organizational unit are hardly checked  for rule violations.  ∗∗∗  Written job descriptions are formulated for positions at  all levels in the organizational unit.  Connectedness  (Jaworski and Kohli 1993)  In our organizational unit, there is ample opportunity for  informal “hall talk” among employees.  In this unit, employees from different departments feel  comfortable calling each other when the need arises.  Managers discourage employees discussing work-related  matters with those who are not immediate superiors.  ∗∗∗  People around here are quite accessible to each other.  In this organizational unit, it is easy to talk with virtually  anyone you need to, regardless of rank or position.  Environmental dynamism  (Dill 1958, Volberda and Van Bruggen 1997)  Environmental changes in our local market are intense.  Our clients regularly ask for new products and services.  In our local market, changes are taking place continu-  ously.  In a year, nothing has changed in our market.  ∗∗∗  In our market, the volumes of products and services to  be delivered change fast and often.  Environmental competitiveness  (Birkinshaw et al. 1998, Jaworski and Kohli 1993)  Competition in our local market is intense.  Our organizational unit has relatively strong competitors.  Competition in our local market is extremely high.  Price competition is a hallmark of our local market.  ∗  All items were measured on a seven-point scale, anchored by 1 =  strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree.  ∗∗  Item deleted after exploratory  factor analysis;  ∗∗∗  reversed item.

Volberda*  EXPLORATORY INNOVATION, EXPLOITATIVE INNOVATION,   AND AMBIDEXTERITY: THE IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL   AND ORGANIZATIONAL ANTECEDENTS**  ABSTRACT  Organizational ambidexterity (i.e., the ability to pursue exploratory and exploitative   innovation simultaneously) is crucial to firm survival. In this study we explore how mul-  tiunit firms might develop ambidextrous organizational units in response to environmen-  tal demands. We examine how environmental and organizational antecedents affect a   unit’s level of organizational ambidexterity. Our study reveals that multiunit firms develop   ambidextrous organizational units to compete in dynamically competitive environments.   Moreover, we show that organizational units with decentralized and densely connected   social relations are able to act ambidextrously and pursue exploratory and exploitative   innovations simultaneously. Our study provides new insights how multiunit firms can   cope with contradictorily pressures for exploratory and exploitative innovations.  JEL-Classifications: M13, O31, O32.  Keywords: Ambidexterity; Exploration/Exploitation; Organizational and Environmental   Antecedents.  1 INTRODUCTION  As competition intensifies and the pace of change accelerates, firms are   increasingly confronted with a tension between exploiting existing competencies   and exploring new ones (Floyd/Lane (2000); Levinthal/March (1993); March   (1991)). Firms seek to adapt to environmental changes, explore new ideas or   processes, and develop new products and services for emerging markets. At   the same time, they need stability to leverage current competences and exploit   existing products and services (Benner/Tushman (2003)). Hence, previous studies   *  Dr. Justin J.P.

We would like   to thank Dania Dialdin, Arie Lewin, and Raymond van Wijk for helpful comments on earlier drafts of   this paper.  J. J. P. Jansen/F. A. J. Van den Bosch/H. W. Volberda   352 sbr 57 (4/2005)  argue that successful firms are ambidextrous (Gibson/Birkinshaw (2004); He/  Wong (2004); Tushman/O’Reilly (1996)), that is, they generate rents through both   revolutionary and evolutionary change (Tushman/O’Reilly (1996)), creating and   sustaining advantages (Grant (1996a)), change and preservation (Volberda (1996)),   or exploratory and exploitative innovations (Benner/Tushman (2003); Levinthal/  March (1993); March (1991)).  Although various studies argue that multiunit firms must simultaneously strive   for exploratory and exploitative innovations, there is little empirical research   on how multiunit firms manage both types of innovations in organizational   units. The lack of research on antecedents is surprising, especially since vari-  ous studies note the difficulty that ambidextrous organizations have in reconcil-  ing contradictory organizational structures in organizational units (e.g., Adler/  Borys (1996); Sheremata (2000)). On the one hand, local environmental aspects   such as dynamism and competitiveness can have contradictory pressures for   exploratory innovations and exploitative innovations (Levinthal/March (1993);   Lewin/Long/Carroll (1999)). Dynamically competitive environments may even   require units to become ambidextrous and pursue both types of innovations   simultaneously (Benner/Tushman (2003)). On the other hand, combinations   of contradictory organizational characteristics such as decentralization, forma-   lization, and connectedness may be needed to develop exploratory and ex-   ploitative innovations simultaneously (Gibson/Birkinshaw (2004); Jansen/Van   den Bosch/Volberda (2005)). Such ambidextrous units combine mechanistic as   well as organic features (Adler/Borys (1996)) or establish centrifugal as well as   centripetal forces (Sheremata (2000)). Surprisingly, there is almost no empirical   research that examines how combinations of organizational antecedents affect a   unit’s ambidexterity.  Our objective in this study is to address these issues and to examine antecedents   of a unit’s ambidexterity (i.e., units characterized by high levels of exploratory and   exploitative innovations). We hypothesize that the extent to which units pursue   both types of innovations simultaneously is shaped by local environmental condi-  tions and organizational characteristics.   By empirically examining these relationships, our study contributes to current   research in several ways. First, empirical research has only begun to explore the   ambidexterity hypothesis by including alignment and adaptability (Gibson/Birkin-  shaw (2004)) and exploration and exploitation innovation strategies (He/Wong   (2004)). This study adds to these studies by including complementary measures   for a firm’s ambidexterity – pursuing exploratory and exploitative innovations   concurrently – and thereby providing additional insights into pursuing contra-  dictory forces simultaneously. Second, our research examines how combinations   of environmental aspects lead to units that pursue exploratory and exploitative   innovations simultaneously. Third, we examine how organizational units are able   to become ambidextrous and develop contradictory organizational characteristics   (Adler/Borys (1996); Sheremata (2000)). Empirical support for our hypotheses   could advance the theoretical perspective (Gibson/Birkinshaw (2004)) that   organizational units are indeed able to act ambidextrously and simultaneously   pursue exploratory and exploitative innovations when responding to their   external environments.  Ambidexterity  sbr 57 (4/2005) 353   In the next section, we present the theoretical review that underpins our hypothe-  ses. We examine environmental and organizational antecedents and explain their   relation to a unit’s ambidexterity. In Section 3 we describe our research method   and in Section 4 present our empirical findings. In Section 5 we conclude with a   discussion of the results, implications, and issues for further research.     2 LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESES  2.1 ENVIRONMENTAL ANTECEDENTS OF A UNIT’S AMBIDEXTERITY  Environmental aspects have been the focal point of research in various studies. In   the context of multinational corporations, Ghoshal/Nohria (1989) examined both   environmental conditions to specify local environments of subsidiaries. Regarding   exploration and exploitation, Levinthal/March (1993) and Lewin et al. (1999) sug-  gested that environmental dynamism and competitiveness may have differential   effects on a unit’s exploratory and exploitative innovations.  Dess/Beard (1984) define environmental dynamism as the rate of change and the   degree of instability of the environment. Rapid change, short product life cycles,   and processes of creative destruction are typical characteristics of dynamic envi-  ronments. Dynamic environments make current products and services obsolete   and require new competences to be developed. Environmental competitiveness   refers to the degree of competition reflected in the number of competitors and   the number of areas in which there is competition (Miller (1987)). In competitive   environments, outcomes of successful exploration tend to rapidly become diffused   over the population of competitors (Levinthal/March (1993)). Therefore, in local   environments that are characterized by high levels of dynamism and competi-  tiveness, units generate rents through creating and sustaining advantages (Grant   (1996)), simultaneous responsiveness and efficiency (Hanssen-Bauer/Snow (1996))   or change and preservation (Volberda (1996)). Units focus not only on enhancing   the scope and flexibility of knowledge integration, but also on improving effi-  ciency of knowledge integration within units (Grant (1996); Van den Bosch et al.   (1999)). Exploratory innovations help units to encounter rapid obsolescence of   products and services (Ahuja/Lampert (2002)). However, without rapid exploita-  tion of the results from exploration, competitors are able to imitate a unit’s explo-  ration efforts and introduce an improved version more efficiently and at lower   cost. In this way, units waste time and resources to exploratory innovation with-  out enhancing efficiency and generating income through exploitative innovation.   Accordingly, units need to synchronize and balance concurrent exploration of new   opportunities and exploitation of existing capabilities (Volberda/Lewin (2003)).  We hypothesize that organizational units that operate in dynamically competi-  tive environments simultaneously pursue both types of innovations. They become   ambidextrous and concurrently develop both exploratory and exploitative inno-  vations to respond to contradictory demands from environmental dynamism and   competitiveness.  Hypothesis 1: The higher the local environmental dynamism and competitiveness,   the higher a unit’s level of ambidexterity (i.e., the level of exploratory   and exploitative innovations).  J. J. P. Jansen/F. A. J. Van den Bosch/H. W. Volberda   354 sbr 57 (4/2005)  2.2 ORGANIZATIONAL ANTECEDENTS OF A UNIT’S AMBIDEXTERITY  To accomplish diverse strategic objectives in terms of exploratory and exploit-  ative innovations, organizational units use different coordination mechanisms   (Tushman/O’Reilly (1996); Van de Ven et al. (1976)). To address this fundamen-  tal issue for managers in organizational units, we examine the influence of various   coordination mechanisms on a unit’s ambidexterity. As have previous studies, we   distinguish between three generic types of coordination mechanisms: (1) decen-  tralization, i.e., the extent to which authority is delegated to lower levels of an   organizational hierarchy; (2) formalization, i.e., the degree to which rules, proce-   dures, instructions, and communications are formalized or written down (Khand-  walla (1977)); and (3) connectedness, i.e., the density of social relations that   serves as a governance mechanism and facilitates the exchange of knowledge   (Jaworski/Kohli (1993); Nahapiet/Ghoshal (1998)).  Combining the required organizational characteristics for pursuing both explora-   tory and exploitative innovations is a challenging task that has received increasing   attention. Recent papers argue that units may become ambidextrous and pursue   exploration and exploitation simultaneously (Gibson/Birkinshaw (2004)). These   units combine organic and mechanistic features (Adler/Borys (1996)), centrifugal   and centripetal forces (Sheremata (2000)), or develop a collective organizational   context (Gibson/Birkinshaw (2004)). For example, decentralization allows for the   interplay between a variety of perspectives and leads to a rich internal network   of diverse knowledge resources (Hage/Aiken (1967, 510)). Decentralization facil-  itates ad hoc problem solving that increases the range of possible responses to   problems and supports exploratory learning (McGrath (2001)). Decentralization of   decision-making supports a unit’s exploratory innovations, but without formal and   densely connected structures these new opportunities may not be exploited suc-  cessfully.  Formalization is generally established to respond to environmental phenomena in   a known way (Daft/Lengel (1986)). Formalization is aimed at reducing variance   through incremental improvements in processes and outputs (Benner/Tushman   (2003)). Through formalization, units codify best practices so as to make them   more efficient to exploit, easier to apply, and accelerate its diffusion (Lin/Germain   (2003); Zander/Kogut (1995)). Thus, formalization enhances exploitative innova-  tions through improvement of current products, services, and processes. It moti-  vates individuals to share explicit as well as tacit knowledge, and it reduces the   costs associated with knowledge sharing (Dyer/Nobeoka (2000)).  Densely connected networks permit individuals to develop deep knowledge struc-  tures and to refine existing businesses, products, and processes (Rowley et al.   (2000)). In this sense, exploratory and exploitative innovations “are supported by   their enabling-organic features while their efficiency and control requirements are   supported by the collaborative, shared control afforded by their enabling-bureau-  cratic features” (Adler/Borys (1996, 79)). Therefore, organizational units that pur-  sue exploratory and exploitative innovations simultaneously must develop com-  binations of organizational characteristics that act complementarily and reinforce   each other (Sheremata (2000)). Such an organizational context supports individ-  uals to engage in both exploration-oriented actions and exploitation-oriented   actions (Gibson/Birkinshaw (2004)). Accordingly, we propose that ambidextrous   Ambidexterity  sbr 57 (4/2005) 355   units are characterized by an interaction of decentralization, formalization, and   connectedness. Ambidextrous units combine these contradictorily coordination   mechanisms and increase both exploratory and exploitative innovations simulta-  neously.  Hypothesis 2: The more a unit is characterized by an interaction of decentraliza-  tion, formalization, and connectedness, the higher its level of ambi-  dexterity (i.e., the level of exploratory and exploitative innovations).   3 METHOD  3.1 SETTING AND DATA COLLECTION  We conducted our empirical research at a large European multiunit financial   services firm. The firm has total assets of more than US $350 billion and ranks   among the top 30 on the Fortune Global 500 in terms of total revenue in the   banking industry. It is a broad-based financial service provider with branches   that are geographically distinct entities that have their own clientele. The prod-  ucts and services of these branches cover asset management, insurance, leasing,   equity participation, corporate banking, and investment banking. We developed   and administered a survey to unit managers of 769 organizational units within 220   branches. A total of 363 questionnaires were completed and returned, correspond-  ing with a response rate of 47.2 percent. The average size of the organizational   units was 32.79 (s.d. = 21.09) full-time employees.  3.2 MEASUREMENT AND VALIDATION OF CONSTRUCTS  This study mainly uses existing scales from literature. However, appropriate   scales for exploratory and exploitative innovations were not available. We took   the following steps to develop new measures for these constructs. First of all, we   reviewed relevant literature and generated a pool of items to tap the domain of   each construct. From the pool of items, we selected unique items for inclusion   in the initial scales. Next, to enhance the construct validity of the survey mea-  sures, we conducted a pretest involving in-depth pilot interviews with 15 manag-  ers with various tenures at different branches. We asked these managers to com-  plete the questionnaire and indicate any ambiguity regarding the phrasing of the   items. During follow-up interviews, we invited managers to provide suggestions   for improvement of the questionnaire. After this pretest, the phrasing of items was   further enhanced by the authors and peers and resulted in a final version of the   questionnaire.  Firm-level ambidexterity. Following previous research (Gibson/Birkinshaw (2004);   He/Wong (2004)), we use a two-step approach to develop a measure for unit-  level ambidexterity. First, unit managers provide information concerning the level   of their unit’s exploratory and exploitative innovations. A six-item scale measures   exploratory innovation. The measure for exploratory innovation (α = 0.85) cap-  tures the extent to which units depart from existing knowledge and skills or exist-  ing customers, markets, and products (Benner/Tushman (2003)). Sample items are   ‘We experiment with new products and services in our local market’ and ‘We   commercialize products and services that are completely new to our unit’.  J. J. P. Jansen/F. A. J. Van den Bosch/H. W. Volberda   356 sbr 57 (4/2005)  A second six-item scale (α = 0.76) measures unit-level exploitative innovation and   captures  the extent to which units build on existing knowledge and skills or exist-  ing customers, markets, and products (Benner/Tushman (2003)). Sample items are   ‘We frequently refine the provision of existing products and services’ and ‘We reg-  ularly implement small adaptations to existing products and services’.  To provide evidence of convergent and discriminant validity of unit-level explor-  atory and exploitative innovations, we perform exploratory factor analysis with   varimax rotation and examine the factor structure of the two measures. Explor-  atory innovation cleanly loads on one factor and exploitative innovation cleanly   loads on a second factor.   To capture a unit’s ambidexterity, our second step for the construction of the mea-  surement is to compute the multiplicative interaction between unit-level explor-  atory and exploitative innovations. Computing the multiplicative interaction   between exploratory and exploitative innovation reflects arguments that both are   nonsubstitutable and interdependent (Gibson/Birkinshaw (2004)).  Environmental and organizational antecedents. Based on previous research, we   include a five-item measure that captures environmental dynamism (Dill (1958);   Volberda/Van Bruggen (1997)). The scale for environmental dynamism (α = 0.86)   taps into the extent to which units encounter changes within their environment.   We measure environmental competitiveness by using a four-item scale (Birkin-  shaw/Hood/Jonsson (1998); Jaworski/Kohli (1993)). The scale for competitiveness   is unidimensional and reliable (α = 0.85).   To measure decentralization, we use the sub-construct of participation in decision-  making (Hage/Aiken (1967)) (α = 0.81). As Dewar/Whetten/Boje (1980) indicate,   we find this the scale to be both reliable and valid. We reversed the score for par-  ticipation in decision-making to measure centralization in units.   To measure formalization, we use a four-item formalization scale (α = 0.74) from   Desphandé/Zaltman (1982), and measure connectedness with a five-item scale   adapted from Jaworski/Kohli (1993). These authors developed a scale for connect-  edness that measures the extent to which individuals in a subunit are networked   to various levels of the hierarchy in other subunits. The resulting scale is reliable   (α = 0.71).  We assess the construct validity of all items pertaining to our constructs through   confirmatory factor analysis. Each item loads clearly on their intended factor (all   factor loadings are above 0.57 with cross-loadings below 0.4) and all factors had   eigenvalues greater than one. These findings support the 7-factor solution. An   integrated CFA on the items of all scales (with each item constrained to load only   on the factor for which it is the proposed indicator) yields an acceptable fit to   the data (χ2/df = 2.2, incremental fit index [IFI] =0.9, comparative fit index [CFI]   = 0.89, root-mean-square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.056). Item loadings   are as proposed and are significant (p < 0.001).    Control variables. In our empirical study, we control for possible confounding   effects by including various relevant variables. Larger units might devote more   resources to innovation, but they may lack the flexibility to pursue exploratory   Ambidexterity  sbr 57 (4/2005) 357   innovations. Therefore, we include the natural logarithm of the number of full-  time employees within units to account for both unit size and branch size.   We calculate branch size by the natural logarithm of the number of full-time   employees within a branch. We include a unit’s age, since age may influence   knowledge exploration and exploitation (Autio/Sapienza/Almeida (2000)). We   measure a unit’s age by the number of years from the business unit’s found-  ing. To control for the effect that units may specialize in different markets with   different ranges of products and services, we add a control variable for unit   client focus. We use a dummy variable to indicate whether the unit provides   products and services for private clients (coded as zero) or business clients   (coded as one). Organizational units with a strong history of high performance   are likely to invest in innovation. Hence, we use a unit’s past performance   measures. Because business units may have different strategic priorities, we   adjust performance data to evaluate each unit. Following Tsai (2001), we use   a unit’s profitability-achieved rate, a unit’s profitability divided by its target   profitability. We also control for a branch’s past performance and include a   branch’s profitability-achieved rate, a branch’s return on investment divided by   its target return. We use internal corporate records to collect the performance   measures and the achieved rates for the units and branches in this study for   the period 2000-2002.  4 ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  Table 1 presents descriptive statistics and correlations for the study variables.

The baseline Model   1 contains control variables. Model 2 introduces environmental and organizational   antecedents and Model 3 includes the interaction effects on a unit’s ambidexterity.  For a unit’s ambidexterity, Model 3 shows that the interaction between environ-  mental dynamism and environmental competitiveness is positive and significant (β   = 0.11, p < 0.05). This result supports Hypothesis 1. The coefficient for the interac-  tion between decentralization, formalization, and connectedness is positive but not   significant (β = 0.05, ns). As proposed by Hypothesis 2, the interaction between   the three dimensions of coordination within units does not increase a unit’s ability   to pursue exploratory and exploitative innovations simultaneously. We note that,   as shown in Model 3, the interaction effect between decentralization and con-  nectedness is positive and significant (β = 0.16, p < 0.01). Thus, decentralized and   densely connected units are able to increase their ambidexterity and increase both   levels of exploratory and exploitative innovations.  Ambidexterity  sbr 57 (4/2005) 359   5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  Our objective in this study has been to explore the importance of environmen-  tal and organizational antecedents on a unit’s ambidexterity (i.e., high levels of   exploratory and exploitative innovations). Although research suggests that these   aspects influence a unit’s innovation stream, studies have only just begun to   explore how units can become ambidextrous and pursue both exploratory and   exploitative innovations simultaneously.  Our study contributes to our understanding of how multiunit firms cope with con-  tradictory pressures from local environments. It provides empirical support for   previous suggestions that environmental aspects have contradictory pressures for   exploratory and exploitative innovation (Lewin et al. (1999)). Our findings indi-  cate that within dynamically competitive local environments, multiunit firms   develop ambidextrous units that pursue exploratory and exploitative innovations   simultaneously. Although Lewin et al. (1999) argue that organizations may opt for   exploitation of niche markets, exploration of new lines of business, or balancing   exploration and exploitation, our study shows that units operating in dynamically   competitive environments pursue both types of innovations simultaneously. Thus,   multiunit firms do not respond to local dynamically competitive environments by   developing units that focus on either exploratory innovations or exploitative inno-  vation, but by developing ambidextrous units that pursue both types of innova-  tions concurrently.   Our findings also show that the interaction between decentralization and   connectedness positively influences a unit’s ability to pursue exploratory and   exploitative innovations simultaneously. These findings contribute to recent   research proposing that units may become ambidextrous by combining   contradictory elements (Adler/Borys (1996); Gibson/Birkinshaw (2004); Sheremata   (2000)). Our study contributes to these recent insights and provides empirical   evidence that a combination of formal and informal coordination mechanisms   (i.e., decentralization and connectedness) enhances a unit’s ambidexterity and its   ability to pursue exploratory and exploitative innovations concurrently.   We note that our results indicate that the hypothesized interaction between   decentralization, formalization, and connectedness is not significantly related   to a unit’s ambidexterity. A primary reason for this result could be that densely   connected social relations establish strong norms and beliefs that diminish the   likelihood of conflict over goals and implementation (Rindfleisch/Moorman   (2001)) and encourage compliance with rules. Therefore, connectedness reduces   the need for formal controls (Adler/Kwon (2002)) and decreases the usefulness of   formalization. Gibson/Birkinshaw (2004), for instance, discuss the fact that systems   used by ambidextrous units are quite simple and often informal, rather than   formalized. Our study confirms their findings and shows that units that pursue   both exploratory and exploitative innovations simultaneously rely on decentralized   and densely connected structures. Additional qualitative studies may further clarify   the roles of connectedness and formalization in establishing norms of behavior,   and in contributing to exploratory and exploitative innovations.  We contribute to new insights on managing contradictory pressures associated   with pursuing exploration and exploitation simultaneously. Because explora-  J. J. P. Jansen/F. A. J. Van den Bosch/H. W. Volberda   360 sbr 57 (4/2005)  tion and exploitation require contradictory organizational mechanisms, previous   research argues that multiunit firms need to separate exploration from exploitation   in organizational units (Benner/Tushman (2003); Tushman/O’Reilly (1986)). In   contrast to creating exploratory and exploitative units (Benner/Tushman (2003)),   organizational units could become ambidextrous (Gibson/Birkinshaw (2004))   and pursue exploration and exploitation simultaneously. Our study provides   empirical support for the argument that units are able to increase both levels   of exploratory and exploitative innovations. In this way, our findings build on   and extend recent studies that discuss the possibility of organizational units in   overcoming contradictory pressures for exploration and exploitation by managing   combinations of contradictory structures.   5.1 LIMITATIONS  Several limitations of this study deserve further discussion. First, our data are   mainly derived from self-reported assessments of unit managers. Although we   took several steps both in the design and testing phases to limit concerns regard-  ing single-informant data, the issues of key informant bias and common method   bias cannot be totally ruled out. However, the confidentiality that was assured   for respondents reduced our concerns that respondents artificially inflated or dis-  guised their responses (Podsakoff/MacKenzie/Lee/Podsakoff (2003)).   In addition, although our results confirm the majority of the hypotheses, our study   is to some degree exploratory. For instance, we developed new scales for explor-  atory and exploitative innovations. Although we conducted additional analyses to   assess the validity of these measures, it would be useful to measure both types of   innovations using objective measures and relate these to our measures.   Moreover, our survey research was conducted at multiple units within the   branches of a large financial services firm. Our focus helped to control for corpo-  rate-, industry-, and country-specific differences that might have otherwise masked   significant effects. Empirical studies in a wider variety of organizations within non-  service industries are necessary to generalize the findings further.  5.2 FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS AND CONCLUSION  The present study provides several issues for future research. Future research may   examine performance implications of different levels of exploratory and exploit-  ative innovations. Although our study shows that environmental aspects influence   a unit’s ambidexterity, we do not examine whether a ‘fit’ between environmen-  tal aspects and a unit’s levels of exploratory and exploitative innovations leads   to above-average performance. Future studies may examine whether ambidex-  trous units generate the highest performance in dynamically competitive environ-  ments, or that units focusing on exploratory or exploitative innovations (i.e., act in   a structurally ambidextrous manner) are able to achieve the highest performance.   Furthermore, our study shows that branches of the large financial services firm   cope with differential effects from local environments by differentiating units in   terms of exploratory and exploitative innovations. In this way, certain branches   may consist of multiple integrated units that are inconsistent with each other   Ambidexterity  sbr 57 (4/2005) 361   (Tushman/O’Reilly (1996)). Future research may examine how these branches   integrate these inconsistent organizational units with different levels of exploratory   and exploitative innovations. For example, branches may support horizontal coor-  dination of these inconsistent organizational units by creating a common vision or   by supportive leaders (Benner/Tushman (2003); Tushman/O’Reilly (1996)).

Volberda, Frans A.J. van den Bosch, Bert Flier and  Eric R. Gedajlovic  How do large firms conduct their strategic renewal journeys in an increasingly  turbulent environment? Are there generic industry patterns, or are these renewal  journeys country- or firm-specific? To answer these questions, we examine the relative  incidence of external versus internal and explorative versus exploitative renewal actions,  and their speed, in leading Dutch and UK financial service companies using  longitudinal data. The context, content and process dimensions of strategic renewal are  distinguished, and research questions about these attributes are formulated and  investigated using new metrics. Findings show that while exploration/exploitation ratios  are fairly similar for firms across the entire industry, systematic differences are evident  between the external/internal renewal ratios of Dutch and UK firms, and that speed of  renewal is largely determined at the firm level. Thus we find that industry-, country-  and firm-specific factors all influence journeys of strategic renewal in distinctive and  complementary ways.  c 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Introduction  This exploratory article investigates the strategic renewal journeys  of large financial services firms in the Netherlands and the UK  in terms of four research questions pertaining to attributes of  strategic renewal, based on an analysis of such actions1 under-  taken during the period 1990 to 1997.  The selection of the financial services sector as the focal point  of our analysis is motivated by two main considerations. Firstly,  the financial services sector is profoundly important to the econ-  omies of many Western European economies.

Following the Herd or Not?210  services firms currently account for seventy-two of the Financial  Times’ top three hundred quoted European companies2 and their  importance in market capitalisation is even greater.  Secondly, the financial services sector in Europe has recently  been confronted with several environmental jolts which have  challenged top management to think of strategic renewal as an  ongoing journey instead of a destination. The past decade has  witnessed the introduction, in 1992, of a single European market  permitting cross-border mergers and alliances and the breaking  down of barriers between banking and insurance sectors.3 At the  same time, firms have had to adapt to important new European  directives and rules of corporate governance such as the intro-  duction of new rules of compliance (for instance, the Basle  Agreement), and the deregulation of capital markets. More  recently, in 1999, companies were faced with the introduction of  the Euro. In 2002, these same companies must manage the abol-  ition of national currencies. In the midst of these structural  changes, established banks and insurance companies have had to  learn to embrace new information and communication techno-  logies and electronic commerce.3 These developments have given  rise to an emerging online financial services complex4 and cre-  ated another major challenge for financial services providers.  In this turbulent environment, both researchers and prac-  titioners need theories to inform and metrics to measure how  and why firms take actions to renew themselves. The theoretical  approach employed here is geared towards providing insights  about pressing and largely unanswered questions. Consequently,  our theoretical approach is eclectic, and is aimed at describing  and analysing how strategic renewal trajectories are developed  over time by top management teams, rather than on developing  an all-encompassing theory of strategic renewal. Our empirical  approach focuses on developing and measuring new metrics to  reveal insights into key attributes of strategic renewal, facilitating  the analysis and comparison of strategic renewal processes within  and between firms over time and across different nations.5 As  managers tend to better remember their successes than their fail-  ures, we have designed our metrics to capture a firm’s realised  actions rather than perceived actions, allowing us to study the  actual behaviour of firms and preventing ex post sense-making.  Our metrics incorporate actions reported as confirmed in annual  reports and the Financial Times over the period 1990–97, to log  only those actions known to have materialised rather than pro-  posed actions and speculative reports.  This article proceeds as follows. The next section distinguishes  between three dimensions of strategic renewal, presenting an  attribute for each dimension. The second section presents the  four research questions that guide this article, and is followed  by a description of our research methodology. Next, we present  evidence from our data pertaining to our research questions. The  fifth section discusses industry-, country- and firm-level influ-  ences on journeys of strategic renewal and offers our conclusions.  Dimensions of strategic renewal  During their strategic renewal journeys, firms go through a series  of multi-level changes. We have chosen to reduce this complexity  by focusing on the most important renewal actions undertaken  by these firms. We do this by investigating the report of the  management board in the annual report, and relevant reports in  the Financial Times. We consider the strategic renewal construct,  like strategy, as a three-dimensional phenomenon, consisting of  the context, content and process of strategic renewal.6  The context dimension refers to the ‘where’ question of strat-  egy—that is, the environments in which firms operate—and  reflects the fact that strategies do not arise from an organisational  vacuum. The content dimension concentrates on the ‘what’ of  strategy, while the process dimension looks at the ‘how’, ‘who’  and ‘when’ of strategy. We measure the three dimensions by  tracking the number and rate of strategic renewal actions.  Actions are divided into mergers and alliances versus new busi-  ness ventures and new product launches to study the renewal  context.7 To assess the content of renewal actions, we divide  renewal actions into exploration versus exploitation-type actions.  Exploration actions are aimed at entering new markets and inno-  vation, whereas exploitation actions increase efficiency and  rationalise activities. The process dimension is captured by the  speed of renewal actions in terms of the number of actions per  time period.  Research questions  Our research questions are rooted in the literature. Penrose8 was  one of the first scholars to analyse the growth processes of firms  by introducing discussion of the influences of managerial  resources on the choices managers should make regarding  internal growth versus external growth through acquisitions.  Other scholars have further elaborated on the context dimension  by studying internal growth trajectories, often in terms of new  business development.9 We formulate the following question:  ‘How do firms combine external and internal actions during  their strategic renewal journeys?’ (This query links to the debate  on the merits of internal (hierarchy) versus external (market)  development trajectories.)10  We measure the content dimension of strategic renewal by  analysing whether actions of strategic renewal are of an explora-  tive or exploitative nature.11 While exploitation is primarily  related to refinement and improvement in efficiency of existing  activities, exploration is related to search and innovation activi-  ties. Firms that simply exploit their capabilities and resources to  the full, avoiding upgrading and innovation, fall into a com-  petence trap.12 March13 has used simulations to suggest that the  optimal path is one of balanced exploration and exploitation, yet  this has not been tested with real data.  This leads us to our second question: ‘How does the balance  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 211  The context  dimension refers to  the ‘where’ question  of strategy and  reflects the fact that  strategies do not arise  from an  organisational  vacuum  Is the financial  awareness of a firm  related to the speed  with which it  undertakes renewal  actions?  Following the Herd or Not?212  of exploration and exploitation actions evolve during strategic  renewal journeys?’  Much research in strategic management is devoted to issues  pertaining to comparative statics. However, taking speed seri-  ously in strategy research is still a major challenge.14 To investi-  gate the process dimension of strategic renewal, we have investi-  gated the speed of renewal actions. D’Aveni, in his discussion of  hyper-competition,15 emphasises that success is often tied to  speed, although Dumaine16 and Stalk17 argue persuasively that  too short a reaction time can lead to overreaction and excessive  information searches, and even result in chaos. However, in  reality, many managers act prudently and wait until the impact  of external turbulence reaches a certain level before responding,  a tactic which often results in organisational inertia18 and causes  longer delays and more muted actions.19 Our third question thus  reads: ‘Do firms differ in the speed of their renewal actions? Is  the financial awareness of a firm related to the speed with which  it undertakes renewal actions?’  Are trajectories of strategic renewal idiosyncratic and driven  by firm-specific factors, or do mimetic forces lead firms to follow  similar trajectories? If firms follow similar trajectories, what is  the basis of this similarity? Institutional theory suggests that  organisations are converging on organisational archetypes as a  result of population isomorphism.20 Another strand of theories  argues for national cultural differences as reasons why organis-  ations collect and process information differently.21 Newman and  Nollen state, “managerial attitudes, values, and efficacy differ  across national cultures.”22 Organisations may have differing  strategic orientations depending on their national culture.  Strategic choice theories endow organisations with the capacity  to reshape their environment. Thompson23 rejects environmental  determinism by presenting a contingency approach in which an  organisation’s decision makers take both the environment and  technology into account. Child24 stresses the dynamic inter-  change between an organisation and its environment, arguing  Exhibit 1. Renewal: four research questions  1. How do firms combine external and internal strategic actions  during their strategic renewal journeys?  2. How does the balance of exploration and exploitation actions  evolve during strategic renewal journeys?  3. Do firms differ in the speed of their renewal actions? Is the  financial awareness of a firm related to the speed with which it  undertakes renewal actions?  4. Are trajectories of strategic renewal idiosyncratic, or do they  reveal mimetic behaviour in terms of country or industry  influences?  that decision makers have much more freedom than environ-  mental determinism would allot them. Baden-Fuller and Stop-  ford25 stress the importance of managerial choice by arguing that  it is not industry- or country-specific advantages, but managerial  action that is the most important determinant of firm perform-  ance. The issue of whether firms mimic the actions of others  within their industrial or national context, or undertake initiat-  ives independently of other organisations, leads to our final ques-  tion: ‘Are trajectories of strategic renewal idiosyncratic, or do  they reveal mimetic behaviour in terms of country or industry  influences?’ Exhibit 1 summarises these four questions.  Methods  Sample  The Netherlands and the UK offer interesting national contexts  in which to investigate the renewal actions of financial corpora-  tions.3 In the Netherlands, we chose the five largest financial ser-  vices companies: ABN AMRO, Aegon, ING, Rabobank and For-  tis. Four are publicly quoted; only Rabobank is not. We also  examine three of the largest financial services firms in the UK:  Barclays, Lloyds TSB and Prudential. Table 1 provides some key  data about these firms. We examine the 1990 to 1997 period,  which spans a phase of increasing turbulence in the financial  services industry.  Sources of data  Our data collection strategy was geared towards examining pub-  licly available contemporaneous data to track renewal trajector-  ies, counteracting the tendency of interviews to create retrospec-  tive sense-making.26 Our data enables comparisons within a  single firm over time, between firms within the same period and  between firms over time and across nations, and is derived from  Table 1.

We  employed various experts to check our classifications, data and  findings, and applied ‘NUD∗IST’27 software to analyse the data.28  The attributes of strategic renewal are explained in Exhibit 2.  Herd behaviour at industry, country and firm  level  We start by presenting aggregated data at the industry and coun-  try level to answer the first research question—how firms com-  bine external and internal actions. Figure 1 shows country-level  data over time and averages for each firm are presented in Table  2. In the Netherlands, our data show a stable preference for  external over internal moves over the time period (63 per cent  versus 37 per cent). UK firms, however, show a different pattern,  with most of their renewal actions being executed internally (24  per cent versus 76 per cent), especially in the 1990–94 period.  Exhibit 2. The attributes of renewal actions    Internal actions include starting up new businesses, closing  offices, reorganising activities, and launching new products.    External actions include mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures  and alliances.    The external/internal ratio relates the number of external  renewal actions to the total number of internal plus external  actions.    Exploitation actions are defined as renewal actions that  elaborate on the current range of activities and fall within the  current geographic scope, or that rationalise activities. These  include cost savings, the dissolution of product ranges, sale of  activities and increasing scale by merger or acquisition.    Exploration actions are defined as renewal actions that add  new activities to the current repertoire of the organisation, or that  increase the geographic scope of the firm. Examples are Internet  banking, or a bank entering insurance.    The exploration/exploitation ratio relates the number of  exploration actions to the total number of exploration and  exploitation actions.    Speed is measured by the number of strategic renewal actions  in a time period.    Financial awareness is proxied by using financial reporting in  the external disclosure of company information.29  Figure 1. Aggregated data of the external/(external+internal) actions ratio. Source: Erasmus Strategic  Renewal Centre  From Table 2 it appears that ABN AMRO has the highest ratio  of external to internal actions. Its ratio exceeds 0.5 for all years,  except for 1993 during which all its actions were internally ori-  ented. ING had the lowest ratio of external to internal actions  of the Dutch firms investigated. In the first two and the final  year of investigation, ING employed predominantly external  actions, but for most of the years in the investigation period its  pattern of actions was biased towards internal actions.  In the UK, Barclays shows a consistent bias towards internal  actions over the entire time period. As appears from Figure 2,  the first and the last three years show a slightly higher ratio.  Lloyds shows a different pattern, starting out with predominantly  internally-driven actions in 1990 and 1991, changing to a rela-  tively high ratio of external actions in 1992 and 1993, and  reverting to internal actions in the last four years. Prudential is  Table 2. Average external/internal actions ratio and average  exploration/exploitation ratio (1990–97).

Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 215  Following the Herd or Not?216  consistently biased towards internal actions: only in the last three  years of the time period does its ratio of external actions  increase slightly.  We use country level (Figure 3) and firm level (Table 2) data  to shed light on the second question: how does the balance of  exploration and exploitation evolve? Surprisingly, our data  (Figure 3) show a consistent pattern across all firms and both  countries. The data in Figure 3 show that, in the beginning of  the 1990s, the ratio of exploration to exploitation remained stable  at about 20 per cent, despite noticeable changes in the Dutch  financial sector in 1990.  The aggregate data for the UK firms show that, as in The  Netherlands, the 1990–93 time period was characterised by rela-  tively low ratios of exploration to exploitation, at about 20 per  cent. In this period, the UK economy was in a slump, and the  three companies reacted to this by cutting (overseas) operations,  closing branches and shedding thousands of jobs. In 1994, the  sector had caught its breath and started to expand, as is shown  in a substantial increase in exploratory relative to exploitative  actions within the three firms. The next year saw a drop in the  exploration/exploitation ratio, a wave pattern that is repeated in  1996 and 1997.  Figure 4 and Table 2 provide an overview of the ratio of explo-  ration to the total number of actions. Clearly, ING is the most  explorative firm in either country, while Rabobank and Fortis  Figure 2. The external/(external+internal) ratio sample average of the Dutch and UK companies to the  representative firms. Source: Erasmus Strategic Renewal Centre  Figure 3. Aggregated data of the exploration/(exploration+exploitation) actions ratio. Source: Erasmus  Strategic Renewal Centre  are the most exploitation-oriented. Contrary to the findings with  respect to external and internal actions, Dutch and UK firms  show a high degree of similarity in their cumulative patterns of  exploitation versus exploration (see Figure 3 and Table 2). The  first four years (1990–93) show high degrees of exploitation, fol-  lowed by an increase in exploration in the second half of the per-  iod.  Of the three UK companies, Barclays has the most stable pat-  tern of exploration/exploitation, remaining close to 0.2 over the  eight-year period. Lloyds was highly oriented towards exploi-  tation during the first half of the time period, after which its  pattern starts fluctuating between exploration (peaking at 0.5 in  1994) and exploitation. As is the case with Lloyds, Prudential  starts out inclined towards exploitation in its first four years,  after which it shows a wave pattern.  Our third research question asks whether firms that are more  financially aware react faster than others in undertaking renewal  patterns. Table 3 shows a clear country-based difference in the  relationship between financial awareness indicators and annual  numbers of renewal actions, which suggests that country influ-  ences affect the propensity to report financial information. We  have therefore chosen to report findings per country, where our  longitudinal data analysis indicates a clear relationship between  financial awareness and speed of renewal. ABN AMRO appears  to be the most financially aware of the Dutch firms, and also  ranks first in the average number of actions. Of the UK firms,  Barclays and Lloyds have similar scores on the financial aware-  ness indicator. Barclays ranks first in the average number of  actions undertaken, and Lloyds second. Prudential ranks third  in both measures.  ABN AMRO’s financial awareness was above average for all  but two years, and the number of renewal actions undertaken  by the firm was also above average, most noticeably in 1991 and  1996. ING’s number of renewal actions was below average in  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 217  Following the Herd or Not?218  Figure 4. The exploration/(exploration+exploitation) ratio sample average of the Dutch and UK companies  to the representative firms. Source: Erasmus Strategic Renewal Centre  the first three years but increased sharply later. ING’s financial  awareness is about average, declining in the last two years. Bar-  clays’ score on the financial awareness indicator is above average  for five years. Prudential scores below average for six years (and  slightly above the average for the other two years), while its num-  ber of renewal actions remains below average for the entire per-  iod.  To answer the fourth question, whether strategic renewal tra-  jectories differ between firms or are similar on the country or  industry level, we use the findings from the previous three ques-  tions. We can make three observations regarding differences and  similarities in the strategic renewal process.    The average ratio of external to internal actions in the strategic  renewal journeys of large financial service firms is fairly con-  stant within countries. Dutch financials are much more exter-  nally oriented than their UK counterparts, clearly suggesting  the influence of country effects. In the Netherlands, ING devi-  ates from the average.    The average ratio of exploration versus exploitation actions in  the strategic renewal journeys of large financial services firms  is remarkably similar, both across the Netherlands and the  UK. This similarity is probably caused by industry influences.  Table 3. Financial awareness indicatori and average number of actions  (1990–97).

Again, ING is the exception, being much more explorative  than the other firms.    Large financial service firms seem to differ in terms of the  speed of their strategic renewal actions; more financially aware  firms engage in a greater number of renewal actions.  To illustrate these findings, Figure 5 positions the Dutch and  UK companies according to two strategic renewal dimensions,  the horizontal axis showing the average external/internal ratio  over the eight-year research period while the vertical axis depicts  the average exploration/exploitation ratio. (Thus a position in  the lower left corner of the plot would indicate a strategic  renewal journey that is completely internally driven and exploi-  tation-oriented, whereas a journey recorded in the upper right  corner would be totally external and focused on exploration.)  Figure 5 illustrates that the strategic renewal journeys of the  firms investigated in the Netherlands and the UK show strong  similarities, but also interesting differences. All the Dutch firms  were more externally oriented than the UK firms, which have  concentrated their renewal efforts more on internal actions.  Table 4 presents the division of banking versus insurance rev-  enues of the eight firms, illustrating the comparative scope of  the firms studied. Surprisingly, however, in spite of these differ-  ences in orientation and home markets, Figure 5 clearly reveals  their common inclination towards exploitation—as opposed to  exploration-based renewal.

The previous section showed similarities at  both country and industry level (‘herd behaviour’), but also some  interesting differences that are suggestive of managerial choice.  Herd behaviour at industry level: similar  exploration/exploitation ratios  From all our observations, two features stand out (see Figure 5  and Table 4). The first remarkable feature is that of the eight  firms investigated, seven firms show on average rather similar  exploration/exploitation ratios, suggesting an industry specific  common mindset or shared managerial schema,30 at least regard-  ing the content of strategic renewal. Such convergence within  the financial services industry and across two countries is largely  unexpected since our sample includes insurance companies and  banks from different sectors of the financial services industry,  with different regulatory environments and different path depen-  dencies. Moreover, the firms in our study differ in another  important respect: one firm (Rabobank) is a cooperative whereas  the others are joint stock companies. Yet despite these differ-  ences, seven out of eight firms have experienced a common pat-  Table 4. Division of revenues (banking versus insurance).

Weick31 suggests that we can infer beliefs from actions, and if  this is so, our firms may share a common industry recipe,32  dominant logic,33 or top management mindset regarding  exploration/exploitation renewal actions.34 We did not evaluate  whether the causes of similarity lay in features commonly  ascribed to strategic groups35 (such as an emphasis on  exploitation), but we can say that they share a common industrial  context, the financial services industry. This suggests that the  impact of country effects on the prevailing management logics  regarding exploration versus exploitation in the financial services  sector may be limited.30 It appears that ‘herd’ behaviour may play  an important role in shaping patterns of renewal in the financial  services industry: the fact that seven firms in our study preferred  exploitation actions suggests such institutionalised behaviour.  The similarity of the actions in terms of balancing exploration  and exploitation of the firms investigated sheds light on how  managers try to cope with organisational inertia36 and their his-  torical legacy.24 In terms of the resource-based view of the firm,37  they appear to prefer leveraging their routines and resources over  changing the routines and developing new resources and com-  petencies.  Herd behaviour at country level: similar external/internal  ratios within countries  A second significant finding is that four of the five Dutch firms  (ABN AMRO, Aegon, Fortis and Rabobank) show a preference  for using external over internal actions, while UK firms show the  opposite predilection. The preference of external over internal  actions among the Dutch companies is marked, with twice as  many external actions as internal ones. In contrast, UK firms  used twice as many internal actions as external ones. Although  it is not surprising to find that firms differ in their use of internal  versus external renewal actions, it is remarkable that discernible  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 221  it is remarkable that  discernible country  effects contribute to  the explanation of  this phenomenon  Following the Herd or Not?222  country effects contribute to the explanation of this phenom-  enon.  In considering this finding, we cannot be certain about the  underlying mechanism of association as there are multiple poten-  tial explanations. Firstly, these differences may be a manifestation  of differences in managerial attitudes and values stemming from  cultural differences.21, 22 A second explanation is that differences  regarding the external/internal ratio are due to the national con-  text. In the language of Porac, Thomas and Baden-Fuller,38 the  firms are ‘co-located’ in a national context and it appears that  contextual variation31 due to different national contexts might  have a modifying impact on prevailing management logics.  Finally, these differences may be the result of the distinct struc-  ture of the financial services sector in these countries, and their  domestic economic cycles. In this regard, the Dutch sector is  much more concentrated than the British sector. If Dutch com-  panies want to grow, they need to go abroad; establishing a new  branch network is not an attractive option because of the over-  branched nature of many countries and because of consider-  ations related to timing. Dutch firms often have no option other  than acquiring or merging with another firm. While the same  principles apply to the British financial players, they had to over-  come a troublesome period in the early 1990s when economic  downturn forced them to restructure their operations, which are  typically internal actions.  Managerial choice: outlier behaviour and differences  regarding speed  In terms of ‘following the herd’, a notable exception in our sam-  ple of companies is ING. This firm has a significantly higher  than average exploration/exploitation ratio. A comparison of the  development of the absorptive capacity (the capacity to absorb  new external knowledge) of ING with the other four firms might  be fruitful. Such a comparison might reveal that in the co-evol-  ution of the firms’ absorptive capacity and the knowledge  environment of the financial services sector, ING is a special  case.39 It might be that ING’s absorptive capacity is relatively  higher than the other firms studied here, resulting in a higher  exploration/exploitation ratio and more proactive strategic  behaviour.  The firms considered here differ markedly in terms of their  speed of renewal. Among the Dutch firms, Aegon averaged about  3 renewal actions per year as compared to about 10 per year for  ABN AMRO, while similar differences also appear amongst the  UK firms: Barclays has an average of about 17 actions a year,  while Prudential’s average is about 6. As described above, these  differences were to some extent related to issues of financial  awareness, but further research is required to evaluate longitudi-  nally the relationship between speed and financial awareness.  Future research  In future research, we will extend our data analysis to several  other European countries, in particular France, Italy, Norway  and Sweden,40 to investigate the proposition emerging from this  article that the exploration/exploitation ratio is to a large extent  determined by the industry context while the external/internal  ratio is determined by the national context. If these propositions  could be illustrated in empirical research in other European  countries and across different industries, we will gain deeper  insights into the determinants of herd behaviour.  Another issue for future research is the impact of distinct jour-  neys of strategic renewal on performance. For instance, do  explorative firms perform better than exploitative firms? What  is the difference in performance between internally and externally  renewing firms?  Conclusion  All firms investigated have a large number of turning points in  the use of external and internal actions and exploitative and  explorative actions, although it is difficult to identify similar  journeys of renewal. When averaged behaviour across time is  investigated, however, interesting patterns emerge that suggest  influences at the industry, country and firm levels.    We found that exploration/exploitation ratios are fairly similar  for firms across the industry, reflecting an industry-level ‘herd  behaviour’ with respect to the content dimension of stra-  tegic renewal.    At the same time, however, the external/internal ratios of  Dutch and UK firms appear to be different, illustrating ‘herd  behaviour’ at country level regarding the context dimension  of strategic renewal.    The process dimension of strategic renewal, measured as the  speed of renewal, appears to be largely determined at firm  level.  Consequently, our analysis suggests that industry-, country- and  firm-specific factors influence strategic renewal in distinctive and  complementary ways.41  These findings raise the important managerial question of  whether there is one best path of renewal or, alternatively,  whether there are many paths that reach the same goal. The  results from our study show that firms can and do take multiple  trajectories of renewal, although the direction might be quite  similar. (Smith and Zeithaml42 and Volberda43 even showed mul-  tiple effective trajectories of strategic renewal within the same  firm.) On the basis of our empirical data, therefore, we conjec-  ture that firms have not found a single ‘one best path’ for achiev-  ing strategic renewal.  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 223  interesting patterns  emerge that suggest  influences at the  industry, country and  firm levels  We are grateful to the firms  investigated for providing annual  reports and for the expert  opinion that executives have  been willing to share with us.

Following the Herd or Not?224  We hope our research questions and preliminary answers have  increased understanding about whether it pays to follow the  herd, and if not, how and when firms might escape the herd and  explore the world on their own.

Nelson and Winter (1982) describe firms as repositories of  routines, which endow them with a capacity to search. Yet  the same routines suppress attention span and the capacity  to absorb new information by specifying behaviour which  limits the search for new ideas to only those that are reason-  able and consistent with prior learning. In a similar way, in  the resource-based theory, the firm is seen as a bundle of  tangible and intangible resources and tacit know-how that  must be identified, selected, developed and deployed to gen-  erate superior performance (Learned et al. (1969); Werner-  felt (1984)). Teece (1984) has argued that a limited repertoire  of available routines severely constrains a firm’s available  strategic choices. The suppression of choice is a condition  for the exploitation of a core competence and many studies  show that in highly competitive environments a core com-  petence can become a core rigidity (Leonard-Barton (1992);  Burgelman (1994); Barnett, Greve and Park (1994)) or com-  petence trap (Levitt and March (1988); Levinthal and March  (1993)). Firms develop core rigidities together with highly  specialised resources in order to enhance profits at the price  of reduced flexibility (Volberda (1996)). Consequently,  Teece, Pisano and Shuen (1997) have suggested that organis-  ational resources cannot be taken for granted and that there-  fore the firm must remain in a dynamic capability-building  mode.

Models of speed of response in strategic management come  from reactions to crises (see Reference 18). Jensen (1989)  argues that pressures from capital markets urge managers to  undertake action. Generally, shareholder orientation is  increasing as a result of globalisation pressures, but there is  still significant variance across nations and firms (Gedajlovic  and Shapiro, 2001). See M.

DiMaggio and Powell (1983) focus on  the influence of the institutional context on the organis-  ational structure to explain organisational continuity and  consistence. By elaborating insights of neo-institutional  theory into a model to explain organisational changes,  Greenwood and Hinings (1986) incorporate the role of  human agency to illustrate the dynamic potential of insti-  tutional theories. To achieve long-term survival, they rec-  ommend a fast follower strategy, which prevents firms drift-  ing away from the prevailing institutional template. See P.  DiMaggio and W.

NUD∗IST is the abbreviation of ‘Non-numerical Unstruc-  tured Data Indexing, Searching, and Theorising’. It was  developed by Sage to analyse qualitative, unstructured texts.  28. Our method allows us to categorise a large amount of infor-  mation from various data sources, and to achieve a high con-  sistency of coding reliability. We recognise that there are  potential biases in our data. Firstly, we measure external and  internal actions as well as instances of exploration and  exploitation actions in terms of their number, and not their  magnitude. This means that actions that have a large signifi-  cance are weighted equivalently to those of lesser magnitude.  While it may have been preferable to weight both external  and internal actions as well as exploration and exploitation  actions in terms of their magnitude, this was impossible as  the Financial Times and the annual reports do not systemati-  cally report the present, let alone the expected future impact  of these actions. On the other hand, since marginal activities  are less likely to be reported than those of greater signifi-  cance, any bias that does exist will result in the elimination of  marginal projects rather than significant ones. Furthermore,  since the marginal projects of all firms studied are subject  to the same potential bias and since actions are evaluated  in terms of their ratios rather than counts, interpretation  problems caused by this potential bias are largely avoided.  A second potential source of bias stems from the fact that  the Financial Times became increasingly likely to report on  the activities of Dutch financial institutions in the latter half  of the sample period. As such, the actual numbers of actions  are possibly under-reported for the early time period (1990  to 1994). Since this bias might pertain to all the firms stud-  ied, it is likely that cross-firm comparisons are less affected.  On the other hand, this bias may have affected comparisons  across time periods.  29. Financial reporting in the external disclosure of company  information is a very important decision of the management  team (Cools and Van Praag, 2000). Jensen and Meckling  (1976) point out that it is a beneficial strategy for managers  to decrease agency costs by committing themselves to pursu-  ing the principal’s interests. Managers can do this by com-  municating self-imposed (financial) targets to which they  commit themselves. We thus chose to identify financial state-  ments in the report of the board and determine the percent-  age of text units devoted to financial statements as a measure  of financial awareness. See K.

Offshoring strategy: Motives, functions, locations, and governancemodes  of small, medium-sized and large firms  Marja Roza *, Frans A.J. Van den Bosch, Henk W. Volberda  Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam, P.O. Box 1738, 3000 DR Rotterdam, The Netherlands  1. Introduction  The relocation of business activity has been employed by companies for many years. Offshoring focuses on the relocation  of business functions from home base to foreign locations. This strategy is labeled as new managerial practice and finds its  origin in the late seventies (Lewin& Peeters, 2006b).Whereas previous theories focus on explaining international production  (Dunning & Buckley, 1977) or geographical distribution of sales (Dunning, 1980), nowadays ‘welfare-enhancing  international division of labor’ (cf. Dunning, 2009, p. 10) receives more attention. Offshoring is a new managerial practice  for several reasons. First, the relocation of activities (Manning, Massini, & Lewin, 2008) is the focal characteristic of an  offshoring strategy. Relocation can be labeled as a form of replication. Replication addresses ‘transferring or redeploying  competences from one concrete economic setting to another (Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997, p. 525). Transfer of people or  investments to convert tacit into codified knowledge to exchange knowledge underlie performance gains. Different  governancemodes exist to execute an offshoring strategy. These range from non-equity based to equity based collaboration  towholly owned subsidiaries corresponding diffused, balanced and dominant equitymodes (Anderson &Gatignon, 1986). In  this paper, therefore, we study the most often used offshoring governance modes simultaneously, i.e. captive and outsource  offshoring (Manning et al., 2008). Moreover, firmsmay use different governancemodes for the same activity; this is referred  to as taper integration (Harrigan, 1984) or concurrent sourcing (Parmigiani, 2007). Second, not only ‘simple’ manufacturing  International Business Review 20 (2011) 314–323  A R T I C L E I N F O  Article history:  Available online 21 March 2011  Keywords:  Competence exploiting activities  Competence exploring activities  Farshoring  Firm size  Functions  Governance mode  Location choice  Nearshoring  Offshoring strategy  Offshoring drivers  A B S T R A C T  How does firm size impact on a firm’s offshoring strategy? Are the underlying motives for  offshoring, the particular functions considered, the locations to relocate, and the particular  governance mode different for small, medium-sized and large firms? In this paper, cost,  resource and entrepreneurial drivers are investigated for their relationship with firm size.  Moreover, we hypothesize on the relationship between function, location and governance  mode choices of offshoring and firm size. Using multi-country data of the Offshoring  Research Network (ORN), we present empirical evidence on the three offshoring driver  categories and function, location and governance mode choices of small, medium-sized  and large firms. The results show offshoring might be used as cost, resource or  entrepreneurial strategy. Cost drivers are most important for large and small firms,  whereas resource drivers are especially important for medium-sized and large firms.  Entrepreneurial drivers are most important for medium-sized firms, just like these firms  have a relatively stronger preference for nearshoring. Small firms mostly offshore  competence exploring activities, whereas large firms relocate competence exploiting  activities.    2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.  * Corresponding author.

Cantwell, 2009, p. 36). Global  sourcing has experienced three waves, as three different types of activities have been sourced subsequently, i.e.  manufacturing, information technology and business processes (Kotabe, Mol, & Murray, 2009). Likewise, early offshoring  projects involved manufacturing activities, while more recent projects relocate accounting, finance sales and other business  processes abroad (Couto, Mani, Lewin, & Peeters, 2006; Lewin & Peeters, 2006b). So, intermediate products replace raw  materials and final products. Third, offshoring is characterized by a broad set of drivers, ranging from cost savings to  innovation and from efficiency gains to growth. As such the strategy meets the motives for setting up foreign operations as  mentioned in international business literature, i.e. market seeking, resource seeking, efficiency seeking and strategic asset  seeking (Dunning, 1993). Although location advantages like cost advantages are still important, firms seek for talent and  technology resources and expansion possibilities by offshoring as well. Hence, as offshoring implies relocating activities to  execute international strategies, it is ‘a new variation of FDI, or international joint ventures, or partnerships’ (Lewin, Massini,  & Peeters, 2009, p. 919) to profit from worldwide markets.  Offshoring opens new opportunities for firms of different sizes. Many studies show that also SMEs are important actors in  internationalizingmarkets (e.g. Liesch&Knight, 1999; Oviatt &McDougall, 1994). Research shows their resource constraints to  become less important as technological developments and global markets increasingly have taken away difficulties to access  information (e.g. Liesch & Knight, 1999). Therefore, also SMEs might undertake offshoring and express their entrepreneurial  profile on the international markets as well. Second, offshoring can be used as strategy to globalize and to overcome resource  constraints as this strategy only sparsely draws upon firm resources, because firms’ business activities are relocated. This is  especially true for outsource offshoring (Narula, 2004). This mode circumvents set-up costs of captive offshoring. More  specifically, this studywill discern between behavioral andmaterial differences betweenSMEs and large firms (Rothwell, 1989;  Rothwell & Dodgson, 1993). SMEs are often characterized by entrepreneurial management and quick response to market  changes. Largefirmsusually run the riskofbureaucracyand inflexibilities towardchange (Volberda, 1998).However, largefirms  possessmaterial advantages generating economies of scale and scope, while small andmedium-sized firms are disadvantaged  in this respect. Further examples of behavioral and material advantages and disadvantages are presented in Table 1.  This paper further elaborates on the offshoring drivers and the function, location and governancemode choice involved in  offshoring and their respective relationshipwith firm size. Costmotives are often considered to be themost important driver  for offshoring (Aksin & Masini, 2008; Bunyaratavej, Hahn, & Doh, 2007; Lewin & Peeters, 2006b; Stratman, 2008). However,  other motives, like for example acquiring human capital (Lewin & Peeters, 2006b) or firm growth (Lewin & Peeters, 2006a)  are alsomentioned in the literature. Other parts of an offshoring strategy are function, location and governancemode choices  (Couto et al., 2006; Lewin & Peeters, 2006b; Youngdahl & Ramaswamy, 2008). Firms offshore different types of functions  ranging from relatively simple activities to highly knowledge insensitive activities more recently (Lewin & Peeters, 2006b).  Furthermore, location choices play an essential role in international business strategies (Dunning, 2009). Activities might be  nearshored or farshored dependent on the fit between firm demands and location characteristics. To execute an offshoring  strategy, firms apply a captive or outsource governance modes (Manning et al., 2008; UNCTAD, 2004).  In this paper, we first investigate the differences in offshoring strategies of small, medium-sized, and large firms. In  particular, we will develop several hypotheses on the firm size effects on the underlying drivers, functions to be relocated,  location choice and governancemode of offshoring. Subsequently, on the basis of a multi-country database of the Offshoring  Research Network (ORN), we present empirical evidence on the three offshoring driver categories and function, location and  governance mode choices of small, medium-sized and large firms. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and the  limitations of this study.  2. Offshoring drivers  In this study three different groups of offshoring drivers are discussed. First, scholars apply transaction cost economics to  explain cost drivers of offshoring (Farrell, 2005), in addition to ‘simple’ location specific advantages as low labor costs  Table 1  Examples of advantages and disadvantages of SMEs and large companies.

Low labor costs alone are not enough in explaining the offshoring cost driver, as offshoring increases  transaction costs, which might (partly) offset savings (Stratman, 2008). Transaction costs are increased by uncertainty  involved in the relocation activities (Coase, 1937;Williamson, 1975). Firms exploit their firm specific ownership advantages,  for example economies of scope and technological and organizational expertise, by geographically relocating activities (Doh,  2005; Dunning, 1980). These ownership advantages are transferred to decrease cost levels by profiting from lowerwages (i.e.  location advantage) (Dunning, 1980). In the past, these cost advantages were used to stay competitive in comparison to local  suppliers at foreign locations. However, nowadays, offshoring is undertaken to compete against imparts originating from  low wage countries’ (Coucke & Sleuwaegen, 2008, p. 1262) in the domestic markets (Kotabe, 1990). Transaction cost  economics has shown how to distribute activities over market and firm in a way to minimize internal and external  transaction costs (Poppo & Zenger, 1998; Williamson, 1975). Digitization has decreased transaction costs dramatically both  for hierarchy andmarket transactions (Coase, 1937; Ellram, Tate, & Billington, 2008) and in this way unlocked gaining access  to lower labor costs at offshore locations. It is important to notice transaction costs usually increase by internationalization  processes due to uncertainty involved. Offshoring is a business strategy to perform business activity at offshore locations at  lower cost through market and/or arms-length transactions, thereby reducing summed transaction costs (Coase, 1937) and  production costs. In particular, TCE explains offshoring strategies by lower overseas labor costs, as well as the government  andmanagement costs related to these overseas activities (Coase, 1937; Williamson, 1975). TCE has been applied to explain  offshoring (Stratman, 2008), offshore outsourcing (Ellram et al., 2008) and sourcing (Vivek, Banwet, & Shankar, 2008).  Companiesmay be able to reduce the total costs of labor (production efficiency) and transaction below the level in the home  country either through outsource offshoring or captive offshoring, although there might be ‘invisible’ costs like  communication related costs (Stringfellow, Teagarden, & Nie, 2008) or set-up costs (Ellram et al., 2008) when offshoring  services.  Firms may seek for efficiency gains at offshore locations. Therefore, offshoring might decrease transaction costs. Large  numbers of suppliers at overseas intermediate markets decrease transaction costs (Holcomb & Hitt, 2007). This effect is  strengthened by a more common understanding of the value proposition of offshoring (Stratman, 2008). This decreases  technological uncertainty for standard services. Moreover, available IT and communication systems have importantly  decreased transaction costs (Ellram et al., 2008). Key attributes of transaction cost theory are bounded rationality,  opportunism and uncertainty. Based on these attributes offshoring governance decisions might be taken. Firms may choose  for captive offshoring due to for example intellectual constraints, self-interest and external and internal uncertainty  (Stratman, 2008). However, market transactions, i.e. offshoring outsourcing, may be an attractive option when no specific  investments are required, large number of transactions outweighs high fixed set up costs and further standardization and  availability of products and services on intermediate markets.  Having discussed and explained offshoring cost drivers and the relationship between offshoring and transactions costs,  we now turn to the relationship of an offshoring cost driver with firm size. Although larger companies may benefit of their  scale advantages (e.g. Cavusgil & Kirpalani, 1993) to overcome e.g. set up costs, SMEs might also have possibilities to reduce  their cost levels with offshoring. Offshoring is an attractive strategy for these firms as it only sparsely draws on their  resources while relocating business activity involves fewer resources than starting new business activities. Moreover,  resource constraint firms only have a small internal scale which limits the efficiency of internal production and results in  relatively high internal governance costs (Poppo & Zenger, 1998). Summed governance and production costs (production  efficiency) might be decreased by the relocation of activities to offshore locations. Also, suppliers on the intermediate  markets might generate scale advantages for SMEs by serving different clients, which large firms might obtain themselves  easily. Therefore, offshoring is a strategy offering scale advantages to SMEs, as setup costs are relatively low and their  suppliers also create scale advantages for them. This makes it possible to produce their specialist products at competitive  levels. However, this will not fully compensate their limited material advantages compared to large firms, e.g. financial and  technological resources (Fagiolo & Luzzi, 2006; Lu & Beamish, 2001; Rothwell, 1989; Rothwell & Dodgson, 1993). For this  reason we expect that larger firms are likely more able to gain cost advantages from offshoring. Thus we hypothesize,  H1. Offshoring driven by cost motives will become more likely when firm size increases.  The resource-based view (Barney, 1991; Penrose, 1959; Vivek et al., 2008) explains the second group of driver, namely  resource drivers. From this view offshoring is caused by the availability of for example qualified personnel or capabilities for  business process redesign at offshore locations (Lewin & Peeters, 2006b). Resource drivers focus on knowledge-seeking and  efficiency-seeking, which are the two most important causes for international activity in information-intensive industries  (Nachum&Zaheer, 2005). In this view, the emphasis is on the resources a firmneeds tomaintain and improve its competitive  position. To do so, the firm might also search at distanced locations (e.g. Lewin & Peeters, 2006b; Westhead, Wright, &  Ucbasaran, 2001).  Whereas economies of scope, learning or scale, are typically important in executing ownership advantages (Dunning,  1980), these advantages are less important for resource driven offshoring. This makes it possible for SMEs to profit from  offshoring as theymight use it to acquire and leverage their disadvantaged resource base (Mosakowski, 2002). Smaller firms  face constrained resources (George, Wiklund, & Zahra, 2005; Hoffmann & Schlosser, 2001; Lu & Beamish, 2001), for example  financial resources (Fagiolo & Luzzi, 2006). These companies, therefore, might search for complementary resources with  offshoring strategies, similar to acquiring and leveraging resources with alliances (e.g. Baum, Li, & Usher, 2000). SMEs of all  M. Roza et al. / International Business Review 20 (2011) 314–323316  sizes need to use their external environments to find necessary resources (Dickson, Weaver, & Hoy, 2006). The resources  firms seek enable firms to go beyond performing activities in a cheaper way. Gaining access to personnel and technologies,  for example, gives firms the opportunity to become more efficient, i.e. doing existing things more efficient. Mature  companies might be focused more on managing their existing resource base. However, they also need to manage their  growth (Jarillo, 1989) and seek for resources by offshoring. Smaller firmsmight search for resources relatively closely to their  core activities, whereas mature firms focus on resources more distant to their core activities as they have more possibilities  to build their existing resources within their own firm. Therefore, we expect smaller and large firms to apply offshoring for  search of resources, although the kind of resources might be different.  H2. Offshoring driven by resources motives is equally important for SMEs and large firms.  Entrepreneurial drivers can also motivate offshoring strategies, as a third category of offshoring drivers. Research pointed  out offshoring as a strategy to realize growth (Lewin & Peeters, 2006a) and for less information-intensive industries new  market entry is specifically important (Nachum & Zaheer, 2005). Entrepreneurship theory (Baumol, 1993; Fiet, 2001; Phan,  2004) provides an argument for moving beyond resources to address new resource combinations (Foss & Ishikawa, 2007)  and emphasize the importance of strategic choice (Baden-Fuller & Stopford, 1994; Mosakowski, 2002). Entrepreneurship is  about ‘carrying out new combinations’ (Schumpeter, 1934); it implies the ability to identify new opportunities and to  develop the resource base needed to pursue the opportunities (Arthurs & Busenitz, 2006). Entrepreneurship also reflects the  willingness of firms to grow, explore and stretch the boundaries of the firm (Davidsson, 1989). International  entrepreneurship has been an emerging field of research (McDougall & Oviatt, 2000; Oviatt & McDougall, 2005) and is  applicable in the context of offshoring strategies as well. The relocation of business functions makes it possible for firms to  get closer to potential customers and other opportunities. Geographic expansion is a strategy for small firms to grow  (Barringer & Greening, 1998), which might be realized through an offshoring strategy. Smaller firms may find it more  advantageous to differentiate than to pursue a cost leadership strategy (Porter, 1985; Qian & Li, 2003). The relocation of  activities only draws in a limited way on firm resources, which is typically important for smaller firms due to their resource  constraints. Other entry strategies, like FDI and alliances aiming to set up new activities, are less attractive for small firms  than large firms. Therefore, small firms might use offshoring as entrepreneurial strategy more often than large firms.  H3. Offshoring driven by entrepreneurial motives will become less likely when firm size increases.  We conclude this section with summarizing the three driver categories, the theoretical perspectives and core references,  the expected effects, and how the three categories of drivers are associated with the drivers used in the Offshoring Research  Network (ORN) survey (see Table 2).  3. Offshoring function  More companies start to offshore higher added value activities (Lewin & Peeters, 2006b). Therefore, offshoring activities  might be divided into competence exploiting and competence creating activities (Cantwell & Mudambi, 2005). Whereas the  latter focuses on technologically advanced activities like performing basic research, the former focuses on deploying existing  technologies, like assembly activities. Competence exploiting and competence creating activities closely relate to the  distinction between exploitation and exploration (March, 1991). Exploitation activities are closely linked to cost advantages,  whereas exploration activities are more focused on value creation by innovation. More specifically, exploitation involves  refinement, choice, production, efficiency and selection, while exploration involves search, variation, risk taking and  flexibility (March, 1991).  Compared to large companies, the behavioral advantages of SMEs, i.e. entrepreneurial dynamism, internal flexibility and  responsiveness to changing circumstances (Rothwell, 1989; Rothwell & Dodgson, 1993) might enable them to offshore  activities associated with competence creating, i.e. product development activities. Furthermore, in comparison to large  Table 2  Main theoretical perspectives, core references and illustrative examples of offshoring.

SMEsmight overcome their resource constraints by network  relationships, as mentioned in the overview of Coviello and Mc Auley (1999). Internationalizing these network relations, i.e.  offshoring, might be a strategy to do so. Therefore it is hypothesized that larger companies will less often offshore product  development activities.  H4. Offshoring competence creating activities will become less likely when firm size increases.  4. Offshoring location  Location choice is an important element of internationalization strategies (Dunning, 2009) and is closely related to the  drivers of offshoring; for example if a firm is motivated by cost, then choosing a low-cost location is important. Location  choice of smaller companies is assumed as well to be influenced by limited material advantages, for example financial and  technological resources (Fagiolo & Luzzi, 2006; Lu & Beamish, 2001; Rothwell, 1989; Rothwell & Dodgson, 1993). Smaller  companies, therefore, search for complementary resources, which are more likely to be found in nearshore economies as  these are often more innovation driven. Second, smaller companies are subject to several constraints with regard to  information gathering (Liesch & Knight, 1999) and might try to limit their constraints by choosing nearshore locations.  Although smaller firms possess entrepreneurial capabilities to develop competitive advantages from complex international  resource combinations (Karra, Phillips, & Tracey, 2008) and international participationmight bemore easily possible around  the world due to technological developments (e.g. Knight & Cavusgil, 2004), larger firms possess still greater information  capacity and resources than large firms. Large firms have for example large scale research and development facilities,  whereas smaller firms are often specialists (e.g. Qian, 2002). These differences point at similar differences in information  capacity. Therefore we hypothesize that large firms are more likely to offshore to farshore locations.  H5. Offshoring to farshore locations will become more likely when firm size increases.  5. Offshoring governance mode  In order to undertake international activities, companies can choose several governancemodes as entry strategy. Different  researchers have focused on certain types of foreign market entry. Agarwal and Ramaswami (1992) focus for example on  exporting, licensing, joint ventures and sole ventures. Acquisition, joint ventures and greenfield investment are considered by  Kogut and Singh (1988). Research distinguishes roughly three governance modes (Anderson & Gatignon, 1986). First, the so-  called dominant equity mode, which allows full ownership and control. Second, the balanced mode, which shows shared  ownership, like joint-ventures. Lastly, the diffused governancemodewhich lacks ownership and has only limited possibilities  for control. In thispaper,wedividebetweencaptiveoffshoringandoutsourceoffshoring(UNCTAD,2004),distinguishing,on the  one hand, between full and shared ownership and, on the other hand, no ownership models (see Table 3).  Especially the limited financial resources of SMEs (Fagiolo & Luzzi, 2006; Lu & Beamish, 2001; Rothwell, 1989; Rothwell &  Dodgson, 1993) are expected to have a significant influence on governancemode choice. As ownership, i.e. captive offshoring,  requiresmore capital thannoownershipmodes, it is less likely that thedominantmodewill be chosenby smaller companies in  comparison to large companies. Furthermore, the entrepreneurial dynamism, internal flexibility and responsiveness to  changing circumstances (Rothwell, 1989; Rothwell &Dodgson, 1993)which aremore prominent in smaller companies than in  larger ones are likely to influence a preference for governance modes that are collaboration focused.  H6. Captive offshoring will become more likely when firm size increases.  6. Data and method  The survey data was gathered through an international research collaboration, the Offshoring Research Network (ORN).  This network is led by Duke University US. Universities from Germany (WHU), Spain (IESE), United Kingdom (Manchester  Business School), Denmark (Copenhagen Business School) and the Netherlands (Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus  University) are taking part in this joint research project. The first survey was launched in November 2004. The objective of  ORN is to yearly investigate the adoption of offshoring administrative and technical functions (Lewin & Peeters, 2006b). ORN  Table 3  Offshoring governance modes.

Roza et al. / International Business Review 20 (2011) 314–323318  has been building the first firm-level database on offshoring. Companies were invited by an email invitation to participate in  the survey. The survey addresses questions including when each firm started offshoring, with what particular business  function, where it was offshored, using what governance mode and why. The survey also addressed issues like perceived  risks, benefits and future plans. For every offshored function, offshoring strategy items were asked separately. Companies  could report on more than one offshoring function. To investigate offshoring strategy and the impact of firm size, the data  from the 2006 annual ORN survey were used. We investigated 353 unique functions offshored by firms from United States,  United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain.  6.1. Offshoring drivers  The importance of nine different offshoring drivers used in the ORN survey (see Table 2, right column) was investigated  using a 5-point Likert scale. An exploratory factor analysis (a statisticalmethod used to derivemain categories from different  drivers of offshoring) was done to find support for the three theoretically defined categories. The analysis supports the three  categories of offshoring drivers, i.e. costs, resources and entrepreneurial (all items loaded on their appropriate factors greater  than 0.66, and no cross-loading was greater than 0.26, eigenvalues for each factor were greater than 1).  6.2. Offshoring function  The different functions which are offshored, were categorized similarly to the division of Cantwell and Mudambi (2005)  between competence exploiting and competence creating activities. Functions were divided between (1) Finance/  Accounting, Human Resources, Marketing & Sales, IT, Call Center, Procurement, Logistic Services and (2) Engineering, R&D  and Product Design. The former are assumed to be primarily associated with competence exploiting and the latter with  competence creating activities.  6.3. Offshoring location  The offshoring location involves the country towhich a certain activity is offshored. Nearshoring is for European countries  offshoring toWestern and Eastern European countries and for US to Canada,Mexico, and Central America. Other locations for  the respective countries are labeled as farshoring.  6.4. Offshoring governance mode  With regard to governance mode, the different models were either set as outsource or captive offshoring (Manning et al.,  2008; UNCTAD, 2004). Firms are offshore outsourcing when they outsourced to a domestic partner, an international party  and/or a local party, when they appliedmore than one of these or in case they only answered outsourcing. Captive offshoring  firms form joint ventures or keep full control over overseas activities (see Table 3).  6.5. Firm size  Based on the European Union’s categorization (Wiklund & Shepherd, 2003), we divided firms in three size classes (1–49,  50–249 and +250 employees). Similar categorizations have been made in other studies (Bohata & Mladek, 1997; Sadler-  Smith, 2004). We repeated the analysis using US categorization of firm size (small firms  500 and large firms +500  employees) (Arend, 2006; Dickson et al., 2006), resulting in a two-category analysis, addressing small and large firms.  7. Analysis and results  To investigate whether differences regarding driver categories, function, location and governance mode are present  between small, medium-sized and large companies, ANOVA is used (the F-value of the ANOVA shows whether significant  differences exist between the three groups of companies with regard to the driver categories).  Table 4 shows means and standard deviations of the three firm size groups. Also, significant differences between size  groups and drivers for offshoring are shown. The significance of the F-values has shown that the cost driver, resource  driver, entrepreneurial driver, function and location to be different. Only governance mode does not show a significant  difference. Moreover, we did post hoc analyses to investigate how the significant differences between the three groups  are composed (Table 5). The first hypothesis states that cost drivers are likely to be more important when firm size  increases. The findings show that Hypothesis 1 can be accepted for medium-sized firms as small firms indicate cost  drivers to be equally important as to large firms. With regard to the resource driver, this driver is equally important for  medium-sized and large firms, however, small firms assign relatively the least importance to offshoring as resource  strategy. Therefore, Hypothesis 2 can only be accepted for medium-sized and large firms. Moreover, medium-sized  firms show to be most entrepreneurial driven. Results on small and large firms show these firms to be relatively least  entrepreneurial. Again the research identifies small firms as different group. Hypothesis 3 can be accepted for medium-  sized and large firms.  M. Roza et al. / International Business Review 20 (2011) 314–323 319  Turning to the other elements of the offshoring strategy, i.e. function, location and governancemode, shows the following  results. Large firms indeed offshore the least competence exploring activities, whereas small firms offshore relatively the  most competence exploring activates. Although,medium-sized firms are not significantly different from either of the groups,  the assigned importance of this group is between small and large firms, which confirms Hypothesis 4. The fifth hypothesis  states that farshoring is more likely when firm size increases. The findings point out that this is true for both medium-sized  and large firms. Small firms were expected to undertake relatively more nearshoring; however they report to undertake  more farshore implementations. Therefore, Hypothesis 5 is not confirmed. Governancemode, addressed by the sixth and last  hypothesis, shows not to be affected by firm size, for which Hypothesis 6 is not confirmed.  We repeated the analysis using the US categorization of firm size (below or above 500 employees). This analysis shows  that large firms are relatively most cost and resource driven, and they also offshore exploitative functions and choose for  farshoring. The opposite is true for smaller companies (<500 employees). The entrepreneurial driver and again the  governance mode do not show any significant differences.  8. Discussion and conclusions  Firm size is recognized to be an important (control) variable, but did not receive yet much attention as an antecedent of  firm behavior in strategic management or organization theory literature, like cost, human capital, growth (Farrell, 2005;  Lewin & Peeters, 2006a, 2006b). In this paper, we proposed three conceptual categories, namely cost, resources and  entrepreneurial drivers. These categories were derived from transaction cost economics (and production efficiency theory),  the resource-based view of the firm and entrepreneurship theory respectively. They were supported in the analysis with  ORN data as three distinct groups of drivers. This shows that offshoring allows firms to realize cost, resource and  entrepreneurial strategies. Firms can not only decrease their cost levels at their domestic locations, but they can also improve  their efficiency, gaining access to qualified personnel and potential customers at offshore locations for geographical  expansion. Our findings show that offshoring strategies might be used as cost strategy, resource strategy and value creating  strategies that focus on innovation and growth (Lewin & Peeters, 2006a). Moreover, they show again that managerial  intentionality (Hutzschenreuter, Pedersen, & Volberda, 2007) is important for offshoring strategies (Lewin et al., 2009).  Second, this study contributes to existing research by showing differences in importance companies of different sizes  assign to the three driver categories and the offshoring strategy choices of function, location and governancemode. Contrary  to our expectations, small firms seem to be capable of overcoming their lack of material advantages, i.e. financial and  technological advantages (Rothwell, 1989; Rothwell & Dodgson, 1993). These firms assign the same importance to using  offshoring as cost strategy, farshoring and offshoring competence exploring functions. This might indicate that small firms  may have the so-called born global capabilities to develop complex international resource combinations across the world  (Karra et al., 2008) to profit from lower costs at farshore locations and sending competence exploring activities abroad.  Moreover, once more stage models of internationalization (Johanson & Vahlne, 1977) are questioned as these firms farshore  Table 4  Importance of offshoring drivers for small, medium-sized and large firms (ANOVA) (N = 353).

Research already indicated stage models to be less relevant in nowadays business (e.g. Autio et al.,  2000; Oviatt & McDougall, 1994).  Medium-sized firms, however, favor employing offshoring as entrepreneurial strategy more than small and large firms.  Nonetheless, they undertake offshoring also as cost and resource strategy. Further, these firms choose relatively more often  for nearshoring. Medium-sized firms might still follow a more traditional internationalization path (Johanson & Vahlne,  1977) preferring nearshore locations and exploiting their specialist entrepreneurial profile and finding resources in this way,  while profiting from some cost advantages as well. Interestingly, the governancemode choice of offshoring is not affected by  firm size. In this case both small and medium-sized firms show not to be constrained by their firm size to choose an equal  proportion of offshore implementations to be executed with a captive governance mode. Governance mode might be more  influenced by for example size of the operation, industry and host country (Brouthers & Hennart, 2007).  We will indicate several limitations and suggest directions for future research. First, firms of different sizes seem to use  the offshoring strategy in a different way. Future research needs to further explore and explain these differences and  specifically address the characteristics of small andmedium-sized firms. Applying international entrepreneurship literature  (Oviatt, 2005; Oviatt &McDougall, 1994)whether offshoringmight function as a born global strategywould be a fruitful way  of additional research. Second, future research has to investigate the impact of offshoring drivers on offshoring performance,  for example improved competitive position and firm growth. Research (e.g. Gilley & Rasheed, 2000) has produced mixed  findings. Third, future research needs to investigate firm capabilities. For instance, absorptive capacity is mentioned to be an  important capability to execute international strategies (Zahra & Hayton, 2008), enabling firms to gain profits from their  offshoring strategies. Finally, in future research offshoring drivers and behavior could be investigated in a co-evolutionary  context including the emergence of new organizational forms. Offshoring strategies andmore specific offshoring drivers, are  embedded in a co-evolutionary setting in which the firm and the environment interact (Lewin & Volberda, 1999; Volberda &  Lewin, 2003). By offshoring, business functions of companies become globally dispersed and due to co-evolutionary  processes this might result over time in new organizational forms (Lewin & Volberda, 1999) and capabilities (Volberda,  1998). For example, embedded in firm strategies, strategic alliances co-evolve with other firm strategies, the environment  and managerial intentionality.  In conclusion, our findings help firms to consider offshoring as a strategy thatmoves beyond gaining cost advantages (see  Table 6 for a summary of themain findings of this paper). They clearly show that companies of different sizes might profit in  different ways from their offshoring strategies.

Part VI: How Should Reputations be  Managed in Good Times and Bad Times?  Reputations rise and fall. In this Part of the Corporate Reputation Review attention  focusses on companies whose star is waning. The presentations made at the Stern School  of Business conference and now published below comprise a distillation of the insights  gained by a senior crisis-management practitioner, as well as three case studies and three  more empirically-oriented crisis communication studies. Included in panelists’ presenta-  tions are theoretical frameworks which seek to explain the behavior of managers and  opponents during crisis situations.

The first describes the charac-  teristic of crisis. It is true that every cor-  porate crisis is unique; that is to say, the  underlying circumstances are unique, the  individuals who are involved are unique  to that company or to that organization,  the facts, the timing and anything else  going on in the marketplace, are all  unique. Therefore, every situation has to  be managed on its own terms. When  looking over the history of a host of cor-  porate crises, you begin to see certain  characteristics, or patterns, that emerge  time and time again. Understanding those  characteristics before the crisis besets an  organization will help management be  much more e ective, shorten the duration  of the problem, and shorten the time it  takes to recover.  I want to consider serious crises that  have sudden and severe impact on the  organization. Let me illustrate the point  with an example from Philip Morris. The  variety of anti-smoking initiatives they  encounter in markets around the world  are serious business issues, but they are  not crises per se. However, just before  Memorial Day weekend, 1995, Philip  Morris discovered a problem with an  ingredient that was used in the filter  material for the cigarettes they made in  the USA. They launched a recall which  brought back some 8bn cigarettes from  around the USA within a week. That  was a crisis. That is the kind of event this  article focusses on, and the defining char-  acteristic, in those cases, is the notion of  surprise.  Surprise  Surprise creates the most dislocation. It is  the thing that precipitates the behaviors  that tend to compound the problem and  make it more di cult for the organiza-  tion to extract itself. Perrier, ironically  enough, learned about the contamination  that ultimately led to the largest consu-  mer recall in history, after a public health  inspector whose job it was to test munici-  pal water supplies, used a sample of Per-  rier to calibrate his testing equipment. He  reasoned that Perrier was the purest water  he could find, and intended to use it as  the base line against which he measured  all other water samples. Instead, he dis-  covered the benzene contaminant. Conse-  quently, his agency went to the FDA,  who then went to Perrier in the USA;  Perrier in the USA went to Perrier in  France and, within six days, the leading  bottled water in the world was o  the  shelves, globally. That is what I mean by  surprise.  Lack of information  The second characteristic that executives  find most dislocating in our experience, is  the lack of reliable information. Executives  today, more than ever before, are used to  working in an information-rich environ-  ment. Early on in any crisis, it is a lack of  information they find most frustrating. It is  the phenomenon that leads them to con-  clude that, ‘because we do not know  everything about this situation, we cannot  say anything about it’. Consider TWA’s  initial responses to the questions about  what happened on Flight 800. It is the lack  of information that slows communications,  Page 120  How Should Reputations be Managed in Good Times and Bad Times?  and thereby compounds the di culty of  the underlying situation.  Escalating pace of events  One illuminating piece of news coverage  about an unfolding plant disaster was from  CBS Evening News reporting on emer-  gency response procedures at Kerr-McGee.  There was a toxic leak in one of their facil-  ities in Oklahoma. That night, Dan Rather  led his story by saying that the company  was at fault, in part, because no one noti-  fied emergency services for 20 minutes  after they became aware of the situation.  Think in terms of how fast 20 minutes  goes in an unfolding emergency, and yet  that was the standard that Dan Rather  chose to apply to Kerr-McGee. One of the  things Exxon found most frustrating about  the early hours of the Valdez disaster  involved this sense of the escalating flow of  events. They complained, for example,  that even before their own communica-  tions command center was operational,  several government and environmental  groups were on the scene and had already  held press conferences, defining a complete  agenda for what they would consider to be  an adequate response to this disaster. This  occurred, before the people at Exxon had  even arrived on site and made their own  determination about how much oil was on  the water and what action to take.  Intense scrutiny  The last of the external characteristics  which impose most of the dislocation is  this sense of intense scrutiny from outside.  The idea is that in the normal course of  business, key decisions are made largely on  the basis of research, extensive consultation,  careful deliberation, and then privately,  within that organization. Executives are  not prepared to deal with the intense scru-  tiny early on in a crisis where every single  decision is subject to immediate assessment  from outside. The feedback loop is instan-  taneous. Criticism, praise or anything else  comes back instantly. Consider any of the  major initiatives executives normally take  when it comes to managing or enhancing  corporate image or reputation. They  expect to see results weeks, months, some-  times even years after the initiative has  been mounted. In a crisis, the feedback is  instantaneous, and there is no mechanism  for internalizing and evaluating the feed-  back. If that is how the outside world  responds to an organization in crisis, it is  worth taking a look at what kind of beha-  viors those phenomena tend to lead to  within the organization.  LOSS OF CONTROL  The first and the most consistent complaint  from executives after a crisis is that, very  early on, a sense took hold that they had  lost control; that someone outside of the  organization was defining an agenda for  them, and they were merely responding.  Once that sense took hold, it was very  hard for them to organize and think strate-  gically about the problem. Consider the  Exxon example. There were di erent press  conferences, di erent agendas and articu-  lated solutions fully explained in the media,  before Exxon was even on site. Not sur-  prisingly, in that kind of environment, a  certain amount of siege mentality tends to  prevail.  SHORT-TERM FOCUS  Decision making in this kind of environ-  ment tends to narrow itself down to the  shortest possible time frame. Before Perrier  announced their intention to recall their  product from around the world, they had  made and had to retract three di erent  explanations for the cause and the scope of  the problem. Their credibility was very  low. They had undertaken what was then,  and is still now, the largest recall in its his-  tory; no one had ever done anything like it  Page 121  Part VI  before. Critics from around the world  were saying the product was dead; that it  would never come back. The Perrier  people tell a story of a meeting in Paris on  the seventh day. The entire crisis manage-  ment team was listening to a detailed pre-  sentation by a hydrogeologist, a woman  who was expert in how the water and gas  permeates the rocks under the famous  Spring; a highly-detailed presentation far  beyond the technical expertise of almost  everybody in the room, and yet she had  their undivided attention. What they  engaged in was a dramatic foreshortening  of their focus, preoccupying themselves  with that which is understandable. Rocks  move very slowly. Hydrogeology is a very  static subject, and also there is a lot of  information, or at least expertise, at the  front of the room. Much better to focus on  that kind of presentation than to try and  figure out how they were going to bring  the product back. What they were mani-  festing was not only a short-term focus,  but a panic.  A panic is not necessarily characterised  by screaming and arm waving. Panic can  manifest itself in any number of di erent  ways. In the Perrier example, it was an  inability to do anything other than focus  on the most minute, but most understand-  able, aspects of the problem.  KEY PRINCIPLES OF CRISIS  MANAGEMENT  The next logical question ought to be,  ‘What does one do in that kind of environ-  ment?’ Before considering that, there is one  very important caveat. I have chosen the  word ‘principles’ carefully. There are far  too many experts in the crisis management  field who are willing to propound rules  that must be followed in every situation.  We have found, in our experience, that  those ‘rules’ tend to be very di cult to  apply in real-life situations. At best, I think  there are principles, some of which, taken  together, can suggest a framework for-  ward.  The subject of crisis management is not  nearly as simple as applying a set of rules  for a way out of the problem. It should  not be too surprising that common sense is  one of the rarest commodities available to  most executives early on in a serious crisis  situation.  Define the real problem  The first principle is to make sure you are  addressing the real problem. Too often,  crisis management, at least in the eyes of  most executives, tends to resolve itself  across a very simple spectrum that runs  from Johnson & Johnson, Tylenol on the  good end to Exxon Valdez at the other  end. Their job is to get their company  somewhere closer to the Tylenol end of  the crisis management success spectrum.  Unfortunately, it is not that simple. The  analysis fails to take into consideration the  underlying circumstances of each of those  situations. When I hear someone say  Exxon did not do a good job, the first  question has to be: what would have been  a good job, given the fact that they owned  the boat, they owned the oil, and  employed the captain who ran the boat up  on the rock and spilled the oil. What con-  stitutes good crisis management, under  those circumstances?  Set your own goals and define your  strategy accordingly  What do I mean by defining strategy?  We have considered the Exxon Valdez  case already. Their response was dictated  by plan, which they followed to the  letter. T hey got on scene, set up a com-  mand center, held press briefings and  answered questions as they were asked.  They put out background statements and  held briefings several times a day. What  they did — in essence — was pour mil-  lions of words on top of the thousands of  Page 122  How Should Reputations be Managed in Good Times and Bad Times?  gallons of oil that were already on Prince  William Sound. Yet none of the talking,  none of the background papers, none of  the briefings were powerful enough to  overcome the strength of the visual image  of oil-soaked otters and birds who domi-  nated the media throughout that crisis. So  what could they have done? With the  benefit of hindsight, it is worth noting  that Exxon, immediately after the spill,  became the largest employer in the State  of Alaska. They hired hundreds of people  and boats to clean up the beaches, and  collect the oil on the water. They spent a  billion dollars in the clean-up itself, and  yet nowhere, in that e ort, was there any  visual identifier that it was Exxon behind  the clean-up e ort.  Consider for a moment, whether out  that billion dollars, some amount of money  could have been carved out to put Exxon  jackets on the people on the beaches or  Exxon signs on the boats gathering up the  oil. Would it have made people think  better of Exxon? Probably not, but it  might have begun to associate them with  the clean-up, as much as they were already  associated with the spill. The same point  could be made about the outbreak of ‘mad  cow’ disease in the UK in 1996. Nothing  that the British government, the Health  Ministry or opposition MPs said about the  problem was powerful enough to allay the  concerns generated by the poor deranged  cow shown on BBC and CNN and televi-  sion networks around the world. It was a  visual problem, and the government solu-  tion was verbal, which is why the British  people went o  beef overnight. So much  for customer loyalty in a crisis.  Manage the flow of information  I have already noted the immediate feed-  back loop. Executives are simply not posi-  tioned to evaluate adequately the  information and reactions that flood in  early on in a crisis. Often when a company  has convened its crisis management team,  they are quickly surrounded with the video  reports and all the news clips of the unfold-  ing story as it has been reported so far. By  the end of the first day, the management  team — which is supposed to be evaluating  the situation — has watched or read the  news reports eight or ten times, and they  begin to adopt the vocabulary and the set  of facts as it is reported in the media.  Anyone who has been involved in a media  story knows there are always things in that  story that are wrong. Yet in these situa-  tions, people adopt the media fact pattern.  That is just one way they fail to manage  and assess the information coming in.  However, most companies miss a source  of information that can be extraordinarily  valuable. While they are deciding what  they can and cannot say to the media,  they typically take a young secretary and  tell him or her to sit at the phone, take  names and numbers and not say anything  at all. Unfortunately, in cases where the  company has become aware of the crisis  from outside, those outsiders have more  knowledge of the situation than the com-  pany does. Very often reporters’ questions  contain bits of intelligence which can sug-  gest new areas of consideration for the  team; and yet, all they do is put a secre-  tary on the phone with instructions not to  say anything. The secretary is not  equipped to listen to the questions for the  information that may be implicit therein  and very often opportunities are comple-  tely missed.  Adopt the team approach  It is common sense to pre-assign responsi-  bilities. In the TWA case in summer  1996, it was fully 16 hours before the  TWA Chairman and CEO was able to  be on site in eastern Long Island, at the  TWA command center and, until that  time, nobody was speaking e ectively  from a leadership position at TWA. That  Page 123  Part VI  was the source, more than anything else,  of the criticism that TWA faced after-  wards. By the time their CEO had  returned from London, New York  Mayor Guiliani, and Governor Pataki had  already been to Kennedy Airport, met  with the families of the victims,  attempted to address their concerns, and  aimed criticism at TWA for being insen-  sitive. Something in the TWA plan  should have provided for the possibility  that their principal spokesperson might  not be able to be at the scene for as long  as 16 hours.  Plan for the worst case  Over a year ago New York went through  the worst blizzard in 50 years. The com-  muter railroad in New York City had  spent most of the first day of the blizzard  reassuring commuters that everything was  fine, that they had a plan in place to clear  the tracks, and the trains were almost on  schedule. Tens of thousands of people went  out to the train stations and got on trains  that quickly stalled in the snow. They  spent hours in freezing, dark, powerless  trains. It was a major fiasco for the Metro-  politan Transportation Authority, and so  on the front page of The New York Times,  one of their senior executives said, ‘There  is no question we put together a plan that  was overly optimistic. We underestimated  how bad it would be.’  Plan on the situation getting worse  Be very, very careful about categorical  statements earlier on in a crisis. Understand  the media’s mission. It is amazing how  little e ort goes into understanding what  motivates the prime driver of most crises:  the media. Think about the amount of  energy and time that goes into understand-  ing what drives customer motivations and  what drives competitor motivations. Entire  departments are set up to analyze and  understand what drives a customer, what  drives a competitor, and yet when it comes  to understanding the media, companies are  almost completely reactive.  In order to help executives understand  what drives the media, it is important to  recognize that reporters work in one of the  most intensively competitive industries in  the world today. Each of them, individu-  ally, lives in constant fear of being beaten  to the real story, of being misled by a cor-  porate spokesperson, of losing their job.  They are very much accustomed to the  crisis environment in a way that executives  are not. In fact, there is a certain common  experience between news reporters and the  emergency services people who are fea-  tured most frequently in a news coverage  of unfolding crises. When a news reporter  arrives for work in the morning, it is rare  that he or she knows what they are going  to be working on late in the afternoon; the  same is true for police and ambulance per-  sonnel. They are accustomed to the surprise  and the lack of information. They are  accustomed to the rapid flow of events in a  way that executives never are. As such,  they have a distinct edge over executives.  Reporters are looking for a good story. If  there are victims, if the story can be ren-  dered quickly in terms of white hats and  black hats, and if it is visual, the media will  be on it. The idea of packaging a good  story is not lost on media savvy activist  groups. This quote is from a wrap-up story  on Brent Spar, the o shore oil platform  operated by Royal Dutch Shell. Note the  quote from the Greenpeace person: ‘The  whole point is to confront. We try to get  in the way. Confrontation is critical to get  the coverage in the press to reach the  public in some other way.’  Confrontation is anathema to corporate  executives. Corporate executives who  think in terms of budgets for communica-  tions programs will find this quote interest-  ing: ‘Greenpeace spent a million dollars in  two months in connection with Brent  Page 124  How Should Reputations be Managed in Good Times and Bad Times?  Spar’. Annualized, that is a $6m corporate  communications e ort. That compares  very well against the kind of budgets that  most large corporations spend on their  own corporate image or reputation.  DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS  Direct communications to a ected consti-  tuencies is one of the things that companies  often overlook during a crisis, especially  when it come to things like site security.  Site security sta  are very often retired law  enforcement o cers. The media are  attracted to them. More than once, we  have encountered gate guards giving their  own impromptu press conferences during a  major emergency. Another external consti-  tuency who shape perceptions are the  ‘experts’. One of the things that helped  Perrier relaunch their product after many  weeks of being out of the market in the  USA, was an e ort that they made to get  back to each of the self-described market-  ing experts who, at the time of the recall,  said their brand was dead. They carefully  recorded the names of all those people, and  before they announced their recall inten-  tions, they sent the press kit on the  repackaging to all those individuals, with a  note that said, ‘thought you would like to  see this.’ They knew that reporters are  creatures of habit. The reporters got good  quotes from these people before, so when  Perrier announced their relaunch plan, the  reporters went right back to those sources  and the universally negative opinion they  received before, turned around to neutral,  and in some cases actually positive.  Remember the role outside experts can  play in shaping perceptions.  TECHNOLOGY  There are technologies today that allow  organizations to communicate directly to  a ected constituencies as fast as the media.  Yet, the morning of a crisis is not the time  to find out how to run a satellite telecon-  ference or how to add material to your  web page. Finally, always measure. It is  vital to measure consistently and continu-  ously to know that you are saying what  your constituencies need to hear, not neces-  sarily what you want to say. Omnibus sur-  veys, select polling and focus groups can be  accessed and implemented quickly, so that  you generate real data about what the real  world is thinking, seeing and hearing about  your problem as soon as 48 hours of its  unfolding.  CONCLUSION  In summary, understand the environment.  Be aware of those who would prescribe  rules for you; at best, there are only princi-  ples. Define a strategy in terms of the pro-  blem that you are trying to solve, not an  artificially imposed standard of good or  bad crisis management. Manage the flow  of information, and understand that the  situation is going to get worse. Preassign  responsibility, so that you are not in the  position of TWA, waiting 16 hours before  the one person who can speak gets on site.  Understand the media the way you would  understand the customer and competitors,  but do not rely exclusively on the media to  deliver your message. Communicate  directly with the best available technology  and measure what you are achieving or  what you are failing to achieve regularly  throughout the process.  Page 125  Part VI  Dow Corning’s breast implant controversy:  Managing reputation in the face of ‘junk  science’  Paul A. Argenti, Dartmouth College  INTRODUCTION  This case examines Dow Corning’s breast  implant controversy in the light of current  research on reputation management. It  includes an overview of the company, the  controversy, the corporate communication  function; the rise, fall, and rebirth of Dow  Corning’s reputation, and questions for the  future.  Founded in 1943, Dow Corning became  successful due in large part to its develop-  ment of silicones. Corning brought the  basic silicone technology to the venture  while Dow o ered both chemical proces-  sing and manufacturing capabilities. By the  mid-1990s, Dow Corning had grown dra-  matically into a company with projected  sales for 1995 to $2.5bn, employing 8,300  people, with 8,700 products used by over  45,000 business customers worldwide,  representing virtually every major indus-  try.  In 1995, Dow Corning filed for Chapter  11 bankruptcy protection to deal with the  onslaught of pending litigation as a result  of challenges to its breast implant products.  Dow Corning’s slide into bankruptcy  occurred as a result of mismanagement of  its reputation rather than weak manage-  ment or financial problems. How did this  develop?  Going into the breast implant contro-  versy, Dow Corning had low credibility  (Munter, 1997). First, as many academics  have pointed out over the last five years  (Argenti, 1994; Barton, 1993; Fombrun,  1996) the business environment has grown  increasingly negative and hostile, especially  for big business (Roper, 1996). Secondly,  the company’s reputation su ered a bit  because of its connection with Dow Che-  mical, best known as the company that  dumped Napalm and Agent Orange on  Vietnam in the 1960s. Thirdly, most of the  top management came from engineering  or scientific backgrounds with a rather  insular and narrow view of the external  environment. Finally, Dow Corning had  done little to try to build awareness for  itself until after the breast implant contro-  versy was well underway.  Dow Corning was, however, highly  regarded throughout the 1970s and 80s for  its corporate ethics programs and its Busi-  ness Conduct Committee. Its code of  ethics outlined the company’s responsibil-  ities to its employees as well as its employ-  ees’ responsibilities to the company. The  guiding spirit behind the ethics e ort and  a permanent member of the Business Con-  duct Committee was John Swanson, a  long-term executive at Dow Corning who  had worked in communications for most  of his career. By the late 1980s, the com-  mittee was completing as many as 40 busi-  ness ethics audits a year worldwide. As a  result of the company’s unique emphasis,  ethics had become a key part of the cor-  porate culture and was widely regarded  both internally and externally. The com-  pany’s ethics program was even the sub-  ject of a series of popular Harvard  Business School cases (Goodpaster, 1989a;  1989b; 1989c).  Page 126  How Should Reputations be Managed in Good Times and Bad Times?  THE BREAST IMPLANT CONTROVERSY  Two Houston plastic surgeons came up  with the idea of designing a breast implant  made of silicone in 1961 and approached  Dow Corning to collaborate on the pro-  ject. The implants consisted of a rubbery  silicone bag containing the silicone gel.  Dow Corning had the breast implant  market to itself for many years, but soon  competitors appeared with innovations  designed to deal with some of the pro-  blems women were experiencing with  breast implants. As the market matured,  Dow Corning was still selling 25 per cent  of all implants, but supplying all of the sili-  cone for other implant manufacturers.  The product was left relatively  unscathed until a sensational report  appeared on ‘Face to Face with Connie  Chung’ in 1990, which was the first to pre-  sent the case for a connection between  autoimmune disease and breast implants.  Within a year, a federal jury in San Fran-  cisco awarded what was, at that time, the  largest verdict ever in a breast implant case  — $7.34m. The prosecuting lawyer urged  the FDA to review the documents he had  found at Dow Corning. Dow Corning  released over 800 pages of documents to  the public after pressure from the FDA.  According to experts, such as Dr Marcia  Angell, executive editor of the prestigious  New England Journal of Medicine, the signifi-  cance of the documents was unclear, since  the experiments had little in common with  the ordinary use of breast implants in  women.  Soon after the release of these docu-  ments, and following another sensational  program on the topic on Jenny Jones’s  show, the FDA announced a ban on sili-  cone breast implants in April 1992. Fol-  lowing the FDA ban, a wave of litigation  hit the federal and state courts. More  than 16,000 cases were filed by over  1,000 lawyers in a two-year period. Law-  suits against Dow Corning went from  around 200 in 1991 to 10,000 the follow-  ing year.  In 1994, implant makers and plainti s  agreed on a settlement fund that would  pay $4bn to plainti s over a 30-year  period, almost half of this bill to be paid  by Dow Corning, with the rest coming  from other major manufacturers. Several  months later, 145,000 women had regis-  tered for the agreement despite growing  scientific evidence from researchers at Har-  vard Medical School that found no link  between implants and connective tissue dis-  order. In 1995, Dow Corning entered into  bankruptcy. Chairman and CEO Richard  Hazelton claimed that the company had  filed for bankruptcy primarily because it  was embroiled in an endless sea of lawsuits  and litigation (Hazelton interview, 1996).  The company claimed that hundreds of  multi-million dollar judgments could result  from the suits brought against the com-  pany. At this time, over 400,000 women  were in the class action suit with separate  suits still pending against Dow Corning.  The judge realized that the money set aside  would not be enough to meet the demand.  With over 20 per cent of all women  with breast implants involved in the litiga-  tion and Dow Corning in bankruptcy, the  class-action suit that had led to the agree-  ment began to fall apart. All claims against  Dow Corning would now be settled by a  bankruptcy court. Down Corning’s com-  munications department would now be  responsible for helping to shape the compa-  ny’s reputation as never before.  CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS AT  DOW CORNING  When Barie Carmichael joined Dow  Corning in 1990, she was the first commu-  nications professional to head the function;  before her appointment, communications  had been run by a series of chemical engi-  neers. Carmichael was not completely satis-  fied with her appointment because there  Page 127  Part VI  were two layers of management between  her and the CEO.  John Swanson, the company ethicist,  applied for the new director of communi-  cations job, but ended up remaining in an  internal communications position reporting  to Carmichael. Carmichael found the  formal internal communications function  at the time in, as she described it, the ‘dino-  saur era’. The main source of corporate  communications was, as she said: ‘an  unwieldy set of company magazines that  were unapproachable and untimely. There  was no sense of an internal audience’, said  Carmichael, ‘just a set of pass-throughs’.  (Carmichael interview, 1996). In addition,  the company held sparsely-attended man-  agement forums in a large local theater at  night.  Carmichael sought to change the  employee communications environment by  using Dow Corning’s computer network  for press releases and employee bulletins;  streamlining Update, a company newsletter  created to inform employees of w hat was  going on in the company more quickly;  and setting up more formal employee  forums that were less structured, in which  employees could talk with senior manage-  ment (like the President and CEO) in the  cafeteria.  While the company clearly realized its  problems on the internal side, it seemed  less interested in the area most companies  focus on — dealing with external constitu-  encies. ‘We were naive,’ said Carmichael.  ‘This is a company in the middle of a corn-  field in Michigan. We were not publicly  traded and didn’t have to answer to public  stockholders. And, we were naive about  politics and did not fully appreciate how  Washington, DC worked, or how politics  could a ect the company. Not only that,  but most of management saw the implant  issue as a scientific issue, not one of com-  munications.’ (Carmichael interview,  1996).  Carmichael brought in public relations  experts to help, began to conduct focus  group research on the issue, set up a 1-800  line to handle questions, and participated in  an ‘implant team’ including the chief coun-  sel, head scientists, and the head of the  breast implant business.  In February of 1992, Keith McKennon  took over as Chairman. He had been  labeled ‘the fireman’ for his ability to put  out fires related to Dow controversies  during his 37 yeras with the company,  such as Agent Orange, dioxin, and Bene-  dictin, a morning sickness pill made by  Merrill-Dow that allegedly caused birth  defects. Immediately, he changed the  reporting structure, and had corporate  communications report directly to him.  By putting a high-profile executive like  McKennon in charge of Dow Corning  and moving the corporate communica-  tions function into the ranks of senior  management, the company was in a better  position to deal with the growing contro-  versy over implants.  JOHN SWANSON’S ROLE IN THE  CONTROVERSY  At the same time, internally, another con-  troversy was brewing. John Swanson’s  wife, Colleen, had received implants years  earlier. Almost immediately following the  operation, Colleen’s health began to  decline. She su ered from migraine head-  aches, lower back problems, numbness in  her arms and hands, extreme fatigue, a  burning sensation in her chest, and unbear-  able pain throughout her body. Her  weight fell to a low of 89 pounds.  Although she had been examined by  countless doctors and had received exten-  sive medical tests, the cause of her problem  was never identified. Colleen was con-  vinced that she had discovered the cause of  her health problems. As a result of his  wife’s experience and what he later  described as his own ‘crisis of conscience’,  Page 128  How Should Reputations be Managed in Good Times and Bad Times?  Swanson decided in September of 1991 to  confront management and take himself o   any work connected with breast implants  (Byrne, 1996).  In 1993, Colleen settled a lawsuit against  Dow Corning out of court for an undis-  closed sum; Swanson retired from the  company. By this time, the new CEO was  in place and Barie Carmichael was now a  vice president of corporate communica-  tions reporting directly to him.  To make matters worse, in 1994 John  Byrne, a senior editor at Business Week and  author of several books, approached Dow  Corning about a book on the controversy,  ‘Informed Consent’. Byrne’s paid source  was John Swanson. After several months of  deliberation, the company decided not to  participate in the book as a result of its  non-scientific orientation. Swanson stated  that the science on the breast issue was irre-  levant, which ‘flew in the face of Dow  Corning’s core values,’ according to Car-  michael. ‘We did not want to legitimize  the book by putting Down Corning’s sup-  port behind it. So, in September we  refused to be interviewed for the book.’  In 1995 ‘Informed Consent’ was pub-  lished. Its cover included a sentence in  large type stating; ‘A story of personal tra-  gedy and corporate betrayal . . . inside the  silicone breast implant crisis.’ The book  had also been excerpted in a Business Week  cover story a few weeks earlier. Publicists  for the book were eager to get the contro-  versy back on center stage once again and  Barie Carmichael was approached by the  producer of the Oprah Winfrey show to  put on CEO Hazelton with the Swansons  and author John Byrne.  Carmichael and Hazelton made a con-  troversial decision to go on the Oprah  Winfrey show in October 1995. Women  with complaints against the manufacturer  as well as supporters turned out for what  Winfrey said was the first appearance by a  CEO on her program in ten years. Accord-  ing to Hazelton, he decided to go on the  program to support breast cancer patients  whose story had been largely ignored. He  felt that those women would be more  likely to tell their story — one that was  more supportive of the company — if  Dow Corning’s CEO were present to sup-  port them publicly. In addition, Dow  Corning employees were also eager to hear  top management’s position on the book in  a public forum.  DOWN CORNING’S REPUTATION  BEGINS TO RISE  Hazelton’s performance on Oprah,  although less than perfect, was the first of  many proactive attempts by the company  to rebuild and reposition its reputation  among key constituencies. Following the  Oprah show, ‘60 Minutes’ did a pro-Dow  Corning piece that essentially supported  the company’s position by referring to sev-  eral studies that had been published in  highly-regarded academic circles — espe-  cially the New England Journal of Medicine.  A piece ran soon after on ‘Frontline’ that  also supported the company’s case against  what was now being publicly referred to as  ‘junk science’, developed and supported by  attorneys fighting against the company. In  addition, employees collected $2.50 volun-  tarily from thousands of employees. They  asked each employee who gave money if  they wanted to sign a statement reading:  ‘To Dow Corning Executive Management,  Your Employees Are Behind You 100%!’  The signatures were placed as an advertise-  ment in the Midland Daily News.  Over the next year, The Wall Street Jour-  nal, Fortune, and the New York Times all  began to support the notion that Dow  Corning was essentially free of blame in  the breast implant controversy. It was  depicted as a pawn in a game being won in  the courts by a highly greedy group of  lawyers working together with weak scien-  tists paid o  by the lawyers; all working  Page 129  Part VI  for women who were innocent bystanders  seeking explanations for sicknesses that had  nothing to do with their breast implants.  Dr Angell’s book, ‘Science on Trial’  (1996), was a tremendous reputation boos-  ter to the company because of the promi-  nence of the author and her position that  the breast implant controversy was based  on ‘junk science’ rather than the clear and  valid scientific evidence published by repu-  table academic researchers. Angell slammed  the reputation of the ‘junk scientists’  throughout the book with comments refer-  ring to scientific testimony.  With these academic studies on their  side, in 1996, Dow Corning announced  that it had filed its Plan of Reorganization  to come out of bankruptcy. Under the  Dow Corning $3bn plan, anyone with an  allowed claim would be paid in full. The  plan included $1bn to compensate com-  mercial claims, and $2bn to compensate  product liability claims. One of the more  ingenious parts of the plan was a provision  for up to $1.4bn in a contingent fund that  depended largely on the outcome of a cau-  sation trial on whether breast implants  caused disease.  The reorganization forced the hand of  the ‘junk scientists’ to prove their claims in  court before the company would agree to  any settlement. As a prelude to moving  out of bankruptcy, Dow Corning’s move  was a brilliant strategy to rebuild its repu-  tation and put its opponents on the defen-  sive in terms of reputation management.  After close to a year of rebuilding its repu-  tation and managing its way slowly out of  bankruptcy, Dow Corning’s reputation  was once again under attack in late 1996.  Lawyers for the opposition formed a group  which created a road show that included  John Swanson, scientists willing to argue  the other side of the case, and others. By  December of 1996, the road show had  toured several cities in the northeast and  articles critical of the main-line scientists  began to appear in the national press,  including The Wall Street Journal.  THE FUTURE OF DOW CORNING’S  REPUTATION  Dow Corning must try to use the princi-  pals that grow out of current research to  set a course for the future. Early books in  the field, such as Olins (1989), Garbett  (1988), and Chajet and Schachtman (1991)  focus on a narrow definition of image  and identity rooted in the world of logos  and design rather than the strategic  approach to the area redefined in the  term ‘reputation’. More recent books,  such as Fombrun (1996), show how criti-  cal a role reputation plays in the overall  success of organizations from business  schools to large companies like Dow  Corning. Dow Corning, like most large  industrial firms, failed to consider its  reputation as a strategic tool until after  the crisis developed. Going forward, the  company must now consider its reputa-  tion as a ‘potentially powerful means of  measuring [its] overall performance in a  marketplace made up not only of custo-  mers but of employees, investors, suppli-  ers, distributors, and other observers’  (Fombrun, 1996). Its very existence  depends on its ability to manage its repu-  tation.  REFERENCES  Angell, M. (1996) ‘Science on trial: The clash of  medical evidence and the law in the breast  implant case’, W.W.

Fanning fires: Mitsubishi Motors and the  EEOC  Irv Schenkler, Stern School of Business, New York University  This study examines the recent crisis that  Mitsubishi faced following charges that the  company allowed a pattern of sexual har-  assment and discrimination to persist in its  US subsidiary. The company’s highly pub-  licized denials is a strategy that many large  companies have followed in recent years  when faced with a crisis situation. The  strategy seems myopic and self-defeating  from the standpoint of communicating  with primary and secondary stakeholders.  It has provoked increased coverage and  controversy.  Considering Texaco and Mitsubishi  Motors of America, one would be hard  pressed to find a better set of contrasting  communication strategies for an organiza-  tion to take, in the face of governmental  and media scrutiny. Confronted with a  similar set of accusations, these corpora-  tions embarked on markedly dissimilar  strategies. With Texaco’s response came  the clear signal that its senior manage-  ment would portray itself as participants  of a potential solution. As the crisis  played out, the press coverage began  focussing on the process of conciliation  and settlement — far less dramatic than  the initial scenario with the revelation of  tape recordings and accusations of sys-  temic discrimination within the organiza-  tion.  By comparison, the spectacle of angry  Mitsubishi managers posed to fight back  governmental lawsuits provided the press  with an inescapably meaty opportunity for  further coverage and investigation. In  essence, we can see with Mitsubishi and  Texaco contrasting models for managerial  response to crises as they are played out in  the public eye through the catalyst of  media. Management can:  — counterattack, using the media to  retaliate with an inherent threat of  reverse legal suit, or  — portray itself as a constructive party to  the solution of the crisis.  Page 131  Part VI  MITSUBISHI: A CASE OF  COUNTERATTACK GONE AWRY  In April, 1996, the Equal Opportunity  Commission (EEOC) filed suit against Mit-  subishi Motors of America, charging the  company with allowing a pattern of sexual  harassment and discrimination to continue  against female workers over a period of  years at its principal manufacturing plant in  Normal, Illinois. Unlike Texaco — which  faced charges of a similar sort — Mitsu-  bishi retaliated fiercely: it loudly denied the  allegations, enlisted the participation of  plant workers and bused them to EEOC  o ces in downtown Chicago.  The strategy was quite transparent in its  intent: reverse the thrust of the accusations  and portray government as the villain.  With the initial response, Mitsubishi’s  major player was Gary Schulz, who was  both the general counsel and manager of  public relations for the United States sub-  sidiary of Mitsubishi Motors. His inspira-  tion for such aggressive tactics seems  clearly patterned after General motors’s  actions in 1993 when it challenged MBC  over its Dateline program’s depiction of  the exploding pick-up truck gas tank.  In that scenario, a new approach to crisis  management response was crystallized:  come out aggressively with a counter  story, fight hard, stay in the limelight and  threaten an enormous legal suit. Commu-  nication strategy and legal posturing  became linked. It was not just ‘sue them’,  but stand up in a news conference, speak  passionately and let the viewing public  know why you were going to sue them.  General Motors’s major player was also its  legal counsel, Harry Pierce, who was  rewarded with a very senior position and  also maintains control over corporate  public relations. In terms of reputation  management, one must wonder whether  these two functions are best combined in  one o ce.  In the case of Mitsubishi Motors, the  strategy backfired and the linkage of adver-  sarial posturing with communication strat-  egy provoked even more coverage and  inquiry, but not of a sympathetic sort.  New accusations followed as workers from  the Normal plant claimed they were forced  to participate with company sponsored  public responses. More stories about discri-  minatory practices surfaced.  Three weeks after the initial story broke,  Jesse Jackson entered the picture in the first  week of May, 1996 and along with Patricia  Ireland of the National Organization of  Women (NOW), threatened a consumer  boycott of Mitsubishi cars and trucks. Thus  the controversy also positioned the more  than 40 major companies and 100 smaller  ones that share the Mitsubishi corporate  name into a reputational quandary — they  too became associated with the EEOC  charges and counter charges. The parent  Japanese corporation also became a target  for news investigation.  With the possibility of a possible consu-  mer boycott lead by Jackson, the Japanese  ambassador to the United States, Kunihiho  Saito, worried out loud that the image of  Japanese companies in the USA could  su er as a result of the harassment suits  filed against Mitsubishi. ‘Although this is  an American company, subject to its laws,  it has the name of Mitsubishi . . . so natu-  rally people will associate this incident with  Japanese companies and it may have a  negative e ect on the image of Japanese  companies.’ (Chicago Sun-Times, May 3,  1996).  The events transpiring in Illinois  received a great deal of media coverage in  Japan. In many respects, given the consoli-  dation of Japanese media outlets compared  to American sources, the coverage was  proportionally far more grievous to Mitsu-  bishi. The situation became, in the words  of an Inter-Press Service writer, a ‘cause  célèbre in Japan’. (Inter-Press Service, May  16, 1996). From the daily Asahi Shinbun of  Page 132  How Should Reputations be Managed in Good Times and Bad Times?  May 15, 1996,Kanji Ishizume, an attorney  specializing in international a airs wrote:  ‘Mitsubishi must cooperate with the EEOC  immediately and pay compensation to the  women suing the company. This is the best  way to stop the situation from getting out  of hand, and would help save its interna-  tional image.’ In Tokyo, the Japanese  Prime Minister Hashimoto chided the US  Mitsubishi unit: ‘I have not overheard  them say such things as ‘‘our company has  taken adequate measures to prevent such a  problem from arising.’’ (Agence France  Presse, May 16, 1996).  The Japanese reaction spurred a 180  degree reversal of strategy from Normal,  Illinois. Clearly overruling general counsel  Schulz, the chairman and CEO of Mitsu-  bishi USA, Tsuneo Ohinouye, announced  in mid-May that Lynn Martin, former  congresswoman and Secretary of Labor in  the Bush cabinet would investigate the  issues and by implication, come up with a  means to address the problem from within  the company. From that moment, the  nature of the media coverage altered —  stories began to assess the potential for  change and Martin’s ability to a ect the  nature of the automobile plant’s culture.  The focus moved from repeating and  expanding the allegations to examining the  company’s sincerity and motives for  switching its direction. Martin’s experience  with the media served the company well:  she was accessible, and kept the media rela-  tively well informed of the progress being  made in her investigation.  On July 22, 1996, Martin announced  preliminary measures she would recom-  mend to Mitsubishi Motors to improve  minority hiring among dealers and to  improve the working climate at the  Normal, Illinois, plant. That same day,  Jesse Jackson was in Tokyo, holding a  news conference in which he threatened  Honda as well as Mitsubishi with a consu-  mer boycott. He had come a week earlier  to engage Japanese executives in American-  style ‘jawboning’ on minority hiring prac-  tices. Though his presence generated a  good deal of coverage in Japan, it was  barely noted in the United States. Though  he derided Martin’s package of measures as  ‘a pre-emptive strike [that] did not involve  the aggrieved parties’ (Automotive News,  July 22, 1996), the reaction did not reso-  nate.  From the date of the Martin announce-  ment until November of 1996, media cov-  erage of Mitsubishi’s problems declined  precipitously. While nearly 1,000 printed  articles can be found between April 15  through July 22 in a Lexis/Nexis search,  from August through the end of October,  the company is e ectively not the subject  of media interest. I would argue that to a  large extent, the company’s reversal of  strategy worked in its favor. It is also  important to note the e ect of timing on  such events and subsequent press interest:  from the end of July until the first week of  November, the Presidential elections sup-  planted most issues as the source of media  focus. Not until the elections were over  and Texaco found itself in the harsh glare  of media inquiry (note that the first stories  on Texaco appeared in the New York  Times on November 5, 1996), did Mitsu-  bishi return to the pages of America’s pub-  lications.  Jesse Jackson’s threatened boycott never  materialized — without a ‘news opening’  to provide publicity about such a boycott,  its success would most likely be minimal.  In January, 1997, Jackson ended his pro-  forma boycott.  However, the initial, aggressive strategy  seems to have had a residual, negative  e ect. From the Washington Post of  December 1, 1996, we hear from Richard  D. Recchia, executive vice president and  chief operating o cer of Mitsubishi Motor  Sales of America — the company that  markets Mitsubishi cars in the United  Page 133  Part VI  States: ‘Our image among opinion makes  has certainly diminished. This was a terri-  ble thing from an image standpoint. [He]  acknowledges that the sexual harassment  suit against the sister company has  damaged the overall Mitsubishi name in  the United States.’ The Post also reported  that ‘Mitsubishi car sales through October,  1996 had declined 7.2 per cent from the  previous year.’ By year’s end, figures  revealed a 6 per cent drop while ‘auto  makers over all reported a slight sales  increase.’ (New York Times, January 16,  1997)  In the course of events that followed  Lynn Martin’s appointment, it is worth  observing that the general counsel and  public relations manager, Gary Schulz, dis-  appeared from view. Clearly this was no  coincidence. However, his influence and  presence in the media limelight for nearly a  month also speaks to an important factor  in the relationship between Japanese subsi-  diaries and their parent management.  In many Japanese companies with US  subsidiaries, general management is run by  a Japanese who is assigned to the USA for  a definite span of time. This person may or  may not be bilingual or possess the feel for  US social dynamics. Typically, Japanese  managers of subsidiaries are either given a  good deal of leeway, based upon their  understanding of the market, or they are  given almost none — they simply carry  out strategy determined from the home  o ce in Japan.  When the EEOC lawsuit first became a  subject of media attention, Mitsubishi  Motors’ chairman, Tsuneo Ohinouye,  flew to Tokyo to confer with home  headquarters. ‘Why did I leave at such a  critical time? Mitsubishi Japan was very  concerned, and wanted to manage the  situation themselves.’ (Nikkei Business  Wire, July 1, 1996) Interestingly, he also  averred that ‘had I known that criticism of  Mitsubishi would spread so rapidly, I  would never have left. Our failure to start  public relations in that first week proved  disastrous.’ (Nikkei Business Wire, July 1,  1996).  What Ohinouye perhaps meant in hind-  sight is that a ‘bridging’ strategy would  have been more appropriate. Certainly,  Mitsubishi’s actions were indeed a form of  public relations, practiced in an aggressive,  conflictual mode. It would seem instead  that Ohinouye relied upon the judgment  of the American general counsel, aided and  abetted by a small public relations firm  that had never dealt with a crisis situation  (JSH&A of Downers Grove, Illinois, a  seven-member firm with a practice in mar-  keting publicity (Chicago Sun-Times, April  23, 1996), and guided by the model of  General Motors in their spat with NBC,  drove down a wrong-way street. Com-  pany reputation was a ected in a detrimen-  tal sense.  Like Texaco, Mitsubishi Motors’ long-  term problem will involve maintaining  positive relations with stakeholder groups  (women, minorities) whose perception of  the company may a ect their choice as cus-  tomers. Unlike Texaco, Mitsubishi’s initial  strategy and tactics simply spurred more  inquiry and investigation. While it may  have felt good for a while, the e ects of  the hangover no doubt will not.

Increasing effectiveness of managing  strategic issues affecting a firm’s reputation  Cees B.M. van Riel, Professor of Corporate Communication, Department of  Marketing Management, and Frans A.J. van den Bosch, Professor of  Management, Department of Strategy and Business Environment, Erasmus  University, Rotterdam  INTRODUCTION  From a managerial point of view, a key  question is how companies can become  more e ective in dealing with strategic  issues a ecting their reputation. Academic  literature provides a variety of contribu-  tions that explain and predict decision  making of corporate management and  their external opponents in crisis situations.  Building on these contributions stemming  from di erent disciplines such as public  relations, strategy and marketing, we sug-  gest an integrative framework (see Figure  1) analyzing both strategic issues character-  istics and the characteristics of management  and organizational and communication  processes determining corporate response  to strategic issues and a firm’s reputation.  Based on this framework we suggest ten  propositions as depicted in Table 1. These  A preliminary integrative framework Figure 1  Page 135  Part VI  propositions deal partly with characteristics  of the strategy issues and partly with firm  specific characteristics. Next, these proposi-  tions will be illustrated with key events  and developments in the Brent Spar case,  dealing with the controversial proposal of  the Royal Dutch/Shell Group to sink an  oil storage and loading station into the sea.  This case illustrates how analytical frame-  works can help both managers and  researchers to gain more insight into the  factors that may determine decisions  regarding whether to use bu ering (defen-  sive approach) or bridging (two-way sym-  metric communication) strategies in  comparable future cases.  THEORETICAL BACKGROUND  Table 1 summarizes relevant academic  publications in ten ‘propositions’, provid-  ing explanations for managerial decisions  of actors directly involved in comparable  situations as in the Brent Spar case.  Table 1: Propositions explaining corporate responses to strategic issues  1 External stakeholders will react more negatively on corporate statements if (1) the crisis is unu-  sual, (2) avoidable, (3) there is no clarity in decision making, (4) perceived unfairness in decision  making and a low degree of caretaking for (future) victims, (Brockner et al, 1990).  2 Media coverage will be higher if an issue (1) is promoted by actors with a high degree of source  credibility, (2) provides attractive pictures for television and newspaper use (Galtung, 1965,  McCombs, 1979, Wember, 1976, Neulle-Neuman, 1977).  3 Actions on the original issue become increasingly more di cult to take if a third party inter-  venes in a conflict (Conlon and Fasalo, 1990, Dutton and Jackson, 1987, Sethi, 1979).  4 The propensity to bu er can be explained by ‘organizational size’ and the ‘importance of  resources’ controlled by a firm; a collaborative attitude of a firm’s top management is the most  important determinant of bridging strategies (Meznar and Nigh, 1995).  5 The organization’s tendency to follow a bridging strategy will occur if (1) the developments in  the business environment are perceived as threatening by the firm’s dominant coalition (2) the  communication managers are part of the firm’s dominant coalition, and (3) the organization  culture is characterized by participative decision-making (Grunig, 1992, Dutton and Jackson,  1987).  6 Underestimation of issues impacting commercial processes of a firm negatively, can be  explained by distortion of acquired and processed information by the dominant coalition within  an organization (Larson and King, 1996, Bettis and Prahalat, 1995, Sinkula, 1994.)  7 Firms with an open attitude towards external stakeholders will be led by managers with back-  grounds in output functions (like marketing, research and product development), who have  longer tenure and have spent more years in the organization, prior to the attainment of their  current position, than their counterparts in less open firms (Thomas and Simerly, 1994).  8 Outsiders (external stakeholders) socially construct shared views based on universal criteria of  how to assess and compare target organization outputs. Insiders (ie, managers) have less appre-  ciation for this broader range of expectations. They assess the process details that must be mana-  ged to deliver the output the outsiders desire (Dunbar and Ahlstrom, 1995).  9 Commitments to insiders’ views at the exclusion of outsiders’ views are associated with asser-  tions of unique insider knowledge of practice that outsiders do not appreciate and denials that  such knowledge and contributions can be assessed adequately in terms of universal e ectiveness,  e ciency, and fairness measures (Dunbar and Ahlstrom, 1995).  10 E ectiveness of corporate responses depends highly on consistency in communication, both  within the firm and between internal and external messages (Grunig, 1992, Van Riel, 1995).  Page 136  How Should Reputations be Managed in Good Times and Bad Times?  BRENT SPAR CASE  When in 1991 the oil storage and loading  station Brent Spar was decommissioned by  Shell Expo (a joint venture between Shell  and Exxon), an extensive investigation was  initiated by many companies, in order to  find alternative solutions for removal. The  final conclusion was clear: after the clean-  ing and removal of as much of the waste  and loose materials as possible, sinking the  Brent Spar in the ocean was the safest,  cheapest, and least environmentally dama-  ging method of removal.  Greenpeace, the environmental activist’s  organization, decided after lengthy internal  discussions to attack Shell’s decision to sink  Brent Spar. According to Greenpeace, the  Brent Spar contained more than 100 tons  of oil sediment and over 30 tons of low-  level radioactive deposits, and it asserted  that this mixture of poisonous, non-  degradable chemicals and heavy metals  would be a serious threat to the sea envir-  onment. Further, Greenpeace suggested  that the sinking of the Brent Spar into the  ocean would establish a precedent for the  other 416 fixed oil platforms in the North  Sea, and that the permission by the British  government to sink the Brent Spar in the  sea, had been given on the basis of limited  and one-sided information.  Greenpeace’s thesis that dumping the  Brent Spar would establish a precedent  was rejected by Shell. The granted permit  clearly indicated that sinking in case of  the Brent Spar was the best option, but  that all other cases need to be judged  separately. According to Shell, the Brent  Spar was di cult to dismantle. Green-  peace did not believe Shell’s statements  and decided to start public actions aimed  at altering Shell’s decision. Following the  lead of other environmental interest  groups, it called upon consumers to boy-  cott Shell’s products. ‘You do not throw  anything into the sea’ became the general  feeling, and rational arguments for sink-  ing the Brent Spar into the sea no longer  mattered.  In June 1995, the campaign escalated  against Shell’s Brent Spar plan, due parti-  cularly after prominent politicians publicly  admitted that they were avoiding Shell sta-  tions. The interventions of well-known  politicians increased media attention enor-  mously. When Greenpeace decided to  place an emotionally-loaded advertisement  with the slogan ‘The sea is not a garbage  can’, Shell chose for an ‘advocacy’ adver-  tisement, but again did so with an insiders’  view. The company placed a full-page  advertisement in all main Dutch newspa-  pers. A survey revealed this e ort had little  success in changing the views of Dutch  citizens. A substantial decrease of sales in  Germany forced the company to place an  advertisement in German newspapers as  well with a heading ‘Wir werden uns  andern’ (We will change).  Decision not to sink the Brent Spar  Shell’s top management was confronted  with increasing internal controversies. In  line with company policy, Shell UK, as  an ‘autonomous’ Shell company, was in  charge regarding the decisions to be made  about the Brent Spar. Shells’ top managers  outside Great Britain started to be openly  concerned about sinking the Brent Spar.  These internal controversies made it extre-  mely di cult for top management to jus-  tify the original plan to the public. These  controversies between Shell UK on the  one hand and the German, Dutch and  Scandinavian country companies on the  other hand, increased the pressure within  Shell against sinking the Brent Spar. On  June 20, 1995, Shell’s Group top manage-  ment decided not to sink the Brent Spar,  but take it apart on land. After this deci-  sion Shell UK asked a well-known verifi-  cation organization to conduct some  independent research regarding the con-  tents of the former oil storage and loading  Page 137  Part VI  station. This research indicated that the  Brent Spar possessed far less poisonous  material than suggested by Greenpeace.  Greenpeace was prepared to admit this  and to o er its apologies in public to Shell  at the beginning of September 1995.  Since the decision not to sink was made,  remarkable changes in strategy, or at least  contrasting with the direct past, can be  observed regarding Shell. Shell changed its  communication style completely from  purely bu ering towards bridging. Shell’s  CEO Mr Herkstro  ¨  ter publicly admitted  that the company had to increase the com-  munication e orts, both internally and  externally, and had to place a new empha-  sis on listening and exchanging views  (Herkstro  ¨  ter, 1996).  ILLUSTRATING THE PROPOSITIONS  WITH THE BRENT SPAR CASE  In this section we will confront the briefly  described Brent Spar case with our pro-  posed framework and propositions. The  figures in brackets refer to the propositions  in Table 1.  (1) All four statements seem to be  applicable in the Brent Spar case. Sinking  an oil rig is unusual, in the eyes of the  public, the sinking of it is avoidable (and  preferable), there is a perceived low  degree of caretaking for the future envir-  onment (you don’t throw anything into  the sea) and there is no clarity in decision  making.  (2, 3) Proposition 2 states that the media  coverage will be higher if the issue is pro-  moted by a credible source and the issue is  attractive for television use. In the case of  the Brent Spar, Greenpeace is a credible  source: it has no commercial interest in this  case. The issue is also easy to visualize (a  professional television studio was installed  by Greenpeace at the Brent Spar) resulting  in high media coverage. The role of a third  party in Proposition 3, in this case promi-  nent politicians, escalated the intensity of  the conflict: it was no longer a conflict  between two parties and Shell came under  enormous pressure.  (4) Size and the importance of the  resources controlled by a firm are two  important determinants for explaining the  choice of a bu ering strategy. In this case  Shell, as one of the largest global operating  companies, with one of the most important  products in the Western economy, has a  strong propensity to a bu ering strategy.  The impact of the changed attitude of top  management will be discussed below.  (5) If the developments in the business  environment are perceived as threatening  by the firm’s dominant coalition, the orga-  nization is inclined to follow a bridging  strategy. In the Brent Spar case the pressure  from outside became so intense that the  managers of di erent Shell corporations no  longer agreed with the decision to sink the  Brent Spar. Over time the pressure was  perceived as threatening by the dominant  coalition of the Shell Group. Conse-  quently, the decision not to sink was taken.  (6, 8 and 9) The underestimation  (through ‘denial’) of the negative impact of  a strategic issue is due to the commitment  to the insiders’ views (they have detailed  information) at the exclusion of the outsi-  ders’ view (who only have a ‘universal  view’). As a consequence, there is often  (unintentional) denial of what comes ‘from  the outside’. Shell was committed to their  insiders’ view and could not really listen to  outsiders’ views. Afterwards, Shell’s CEO  Mr Herkstro  ¨  ter publicly admitted that the  company had to place new emphasis on lis-  tening and exchanging views: ‘What  appeared to be the best opinion in the UK  was not acceptable elsewhere’.  (7) The majority of Shell’s management  has a functional background in ‘input’  functions (finance, technology); as a conse-  quence the dominant communication at  the beginning of the conflict appeared to  be bu ering oriented.  Page 138  How Should Reputations be Managed in Good Times and Bad Times?  (10) Public controversies between Shell’s  country management (UK versus Ger-  many, etc.) originated through lack of con-  sistency and, as a consequence, lack of  e ciency in Shell’s communication. The  changes in Shell’s communication style  after the decision not to sink the Brent  Spar seems, on the other hand, to increase  both consistency and credibility of the  company’s messages.  CONCLUSIONS  Based on an integrative framework, this  article has suggested ten propositions.  These propositions have been illustrated  with the corporate responses to strategic  issues in the Brent Spar case. This illus-  tration resulted in an increased insight  into the explanation of Shell’s initial buf-  fering strategy, followed by a dramatic  shift in corporate response towards a  bridging strategy. Two important com-  pany-specific determinants, namely the  importance of the product and the size  of the company seem in particular to  influence Shell’s original tendency to a  bu ering strategy.  As is suggested in Proposition 4, the key  factor in explaining the recent choice for a  bridging strategy, as opposed to the dis-  cussed bu ering strategy in the Brent Spar  case, is clearly top management. In future  research, however, it seems important to  pay attention to both the influence of the  type of corporate level strategy on this  factor (Porter, 1987 and Goold, Campbell  and Alexander, 1994) and the process of  strategy formation in large companies as  well. Such research e orts could create  more insight into the influence of organiza-  tion and management processes on this key  factor. Follow-up research along these lines  could show that, although top manage-  ment is and remains primarily responsible  for the choice of the corporate response to  strategic issues, existing organizational  communication and management processes  can indeed make such a choice very di -  cult in the short run.  The Shell’s most recent Annual Report,  in line with the Speech of Herkstro  ¨  ter of  October 1996, top management refers to  the rejection of the proposed deep-water  disposal of Brent Spar and concludes: ‘We  learned in 1995 that we need to have  greater external focus if we are to create a  better acceptance of the Group’s business  among varied audiences. Group companies  must consult, inform and communicate  better with the public. In such a dialogue  they will need to point out the complexity  of the issues and always balance human,  environmental and economic considera-  tions.’ (Annual Report 1995, 1996, p. 2).  On the basis of the presented framework,  this can be considered as an indication of a  form of a bridging strategy initiated by  Shell’s top management. The meaning of  firm specific characteristics regarding the  organization, communication and, in parti-  cular, top management for the dynamics in  bridging versus bu ering strategies of com-  panies, is once more highlighted.

Corporate environmental reputation:  comparing two industries  Glen Dowell, Anjali Sastry, Stuart Hart and Je  Bernicke, University of  Michigan Business School  INTRODUCTION  Firms construct their reputations — and  have it constructed for them — in ways  that reflect assumptions about what is  important. For instance, Spence (1979,  p.234) defines reputation as ‘the outcome  of a competitive process in which firms  signal their key characteristics to constitu-  ents to maximize their social status.’ Such  an approach to understanding corporate  reputation, however, presupposes firms’  knowledge of the important dimensions of  social status. In many arenas of organiza-  tional life today, these dimensions may be  subject to considerable uncertainty.  In such uncertain environments, the  determinants of corporate reputation must  evolve, as companies search to find the  behavior that is rewarded by their constitu-  ents. This evolution may di er according  to the industry in which a corporation  operates, as the expectations of stakeholders  regarding financial performance, innova-  tion, and social responsibility need not be  uniform across industries.  What happens when firms seek to maxi-  Page 140  How Should Reputations be Managed in Good Times and Bad Times?  mize social status in a changing, ambiguous  setting with multiple constituencies and  multiple demands? We begin to address  this question here by examining one aspect  of overall corporate image — environmen-  tal reputation.  We believe that the environmental arena  provides a compelling example of how  uncertainty a ects firms’ attempts to build  their reputations. The determinants of  environmental reputation are unclear to  researchers and managers alike. There is  some agreement that reporting and self-dis-  closure of environmental issues is of impor-  tance (Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 1993),  but the exact form that the reporting  should take is still very much in question  (see, for example, Poltorzycki and Hed-  strom, 1994; Rose, Brownlie and Simpson,  1996).  To date, firms have managed this uncer-  tainty in a variety of ways, such as by form-  ing industry groups to define shared  orientations towards the environmental  practices and reporting (the now-defunct  Public Environment Reporting Initiative,  for instance), by subscribing to voluntary  standards of disclosure put forward by gov-  ernmental and non-governmental agencies  (such as ISO standards and ideas put for-  ward by the United Nations Environment  Program), and by hiring consulting firms.  These observations frame the research  questions we address in this article. Have  such potential mechanisms for standardiza-  tion resulted in similar approaches to envir-  onmental management? Or, are there  instead substantial di erences in the ways  in which firms in di erent industries repre-  sent their orientation towards the physical  environment?  The next section of this article will  describe the sample of firms we have  chosen, and our research methods. In the  third section, we outline the theoretical  perspective with which we will examine  the firms’ environmental approach. The  last two sections of the article describe our  results and the implications for this  exploratory research.  SAMPLE AND METHODS  We chose to observe companies in two  industries: chemicals and oil. In studying  chemical and oil companies, we examined  firms that are similar in many respects.  Both are mature, process industries charac-  terized by a few very large firms and many  smaller competitors. Both are also seen as  prime environmental culprits. A poll of  Canadians in 1991, for example, rated the  chemical and petroleum industries as the  most environmentally damaging sectors of  the economy (Oil Week, 1992).  Thus, we have reason to suspect that the  environmental experiences of chemical  firms are similar to those of oil companies.  Both industries, for example, have had  high profile disasters — the Exxon Valdez  and Bhopal — that could be expected to  raise both public concern over their envir-  onmental impact and management aware-  ness of that concern.  However, the industries have approached  their environmental troubles in di erent  ways. Responding to crises like Bhopal  and to heightening public concern over  their very products, leading companies in  the chemical industry (eg Dow, Du Pont,  Monsanto) pressed for self-regulation to  avert future chemical disasters that might  threaten the continued survival of the  industry. In 1988, this culminated in the  adoption by the Chemical Manufacturers  Association of ‘Responsible Care’ — a  statement of environmental principles and  codes of management practices that  included provisions for pollution preven-  tion and community involvement.  The oil industry, by contrast, has been  slow to respond to environmental pressure.  While the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989  provided some basis for public pressure, it  failed to engender the same level of fear or  Page 141  Part VI  concern over threats to human life that the  chemical industry has evoked. Unlike the  chemical industry, self-regulation has been  slower to develop with the first industry  initiative (Strategies for Today’s Environ-  mental Partnerships — STEP) coming only  in 1993.  Our intent, then, is to determine if the  companies in these industries construct  their environmental reputations in the  same ways. In order to ensure that our  samples of firms from each industry are  comparable, we have selected the six firms  in each industry with the best environmen-  tal reputations, as represented by the most  recent Fortune ratings (Table 1 lists the six  companies from each industry, along with  their respective Fortune ratings). While the  validity of this rating system has come  under question, it is the most widely  recognizable reputational rating available.  Also, since we are not trying to explain  di erences in reputation, we do not need  the ratings to be able to distinguish  between the firms in our sample, but only  to provide a benchmark for which firms  are considered to have the best environ-  mental images in the two industries.  In order to assess a company’s environ-  mental perspective, we performed content  analysis on its most recent Corporate  Environmental Report (CER). These  reports have become increasingly common  in the past decade and each of the 12 com-  panies in our study has produced at least  one CER.  These reports capture only how the  firms choose to represent their environmen-  tal strategies and may di er from the actual  emphasis they place on the di erent activ-  ities. The choice of what to emphasize in  the CERs is instructive, however, as it  indicates which of its environmental activ-  ities the firm feels are most important to  communicate to the public, shareholders  and employees (UNEP, 1994). In fact, in  the context of investigating corporate  reputation, the CER’s emphasis on what  the company feels is important to its key  stakeholders may be more important than  the actual activities that the company  undertakes.

THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  While our study is exploratory in nature,  we can draw on an existing model of cor-  porate environmentalism for a framework  for analyzing and comparing the organiza-  tions. This model is useful in developing a  holistic characterization of each company’s  environmental approaches, rather than  checking o  specific attributes of the  report.  ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT:  DIFFERENTIATION, INTEGRATION, AND  ANTICIPATION  Several authors have noted the distinction  between a reactive versus proactive  approach to environmental management  (eg, Hunt and Auster, 1990; Smart, 1992;  Walley and Whitehead, 1994). A reactive  approach involves waiting for regulation  or public pressure to define what is  required for the firm to do, while proac-  tive environmental management requires  the firm takes the lead in identifying and  implementing solutions to environmental  problems.  By allowing regulation to dictate strat-  egy, reactive firms have traditionally  depended upon defensive tactics (eg, liabi-  lity set-asides, risk reduction, and specia-  lized environmental sta ) and pollution  control (ie, ‘end-of-pipe’ treatment, com-  pliance audits, and capital expenditure on  mandated control technologies) as their  primary vehicles of environmental man-  agement. Unfortunately, such approaches  are costly and add little value since they  occur as add-ons to existing production  processes and product designs. Reactive  approaches thus lead to di erentiation of  environmental management practices from  business practices (see Table 2).  Table 2: Environmental Management Categories  Di erentiation  Defense Tactics Pollution Control  – Risk Reduction (contingent liabilities – Pollution Control  and set-asides)  – Outsourcing Decisions – Compliance-US  – Remediation – Environmental Capital Expenditures  – Fines/Penalties – Environmental Sta   Integration  Pollution Prevention Product Stewardship  – Pollution Prevention Program – Design for the Environment (DfE)  Program  – Environmental Management System – Product Development  (EMS)  – Energy E ciency – Lifecycle Thinking  – Materials Management – Buyer-Supplier Relationship  Anticipation  Clean Technology Sustainable Leadership  – Clean Technology Program – Mission/Vision  – Competency Development – Stakeholder Communications  – R&D Investment – Management Commitment  – International Emerging Markets – Future Opportunities  Page 143  Part VI  A proactive approach, on the other  hand, o ers the potential to actually benefit  the firm’s core business processes by inter-  vening further ‘upstream’ during strategic  planning, product development and process  design. In an e ort to capture these poten-  tial benefits, Hart (1995; 1997) developed a  typology consisting of four proactive  environmental management strategies: pol-  lution prevention, product stewardship,  clean technology, and sustainability vision.  Through such e orts as waste reduction,  energy e ciency, and materials manage-  ment, a pollution prevention strategy focusses  on minimizing or eliminating waste before  it is created. Much like total quality man-  agement, pollution prevention strategies  depend upon continuous improvement  e orts to reduce waste and energy use.  Unlike pollution control, prevention strate-  gies are driven by a compelling logic: pol-  lution prevention pays.  Product stewardship focusses on minimiz-  ing not only pollution from manufactur-  ing, but also all environmental impacts  associated with the full life cycle of a pro-  duct. As a company moves closer to zero  emissions, reducing use of materials and  production of waste requires more funda-  mental changes in underlying product and  process design, through such tools as design  for environment (DfE), life cycle analysis,  and supply-chain management.  Pollution prevention and product stew-  ardship deal with ‘today’s’ products and  processes. In this sense they are strategies  that seek the integration of environmental  management with business processes. Com-  panies with their eye on the future, how-  ever, can also begin to anticipate and invest  in tomorrow’s technologies. Clean technol-  ogy is characterized by a fundamental  change in core competence that results in a  dramatic reduction in the use of harmful  material or processes. Clean technology  programs involve resource allocation deci-  sions in which environmental factors are  incorporated as part of the R&D and tech-  nology development processes of firms.  This strategy requires a completely new  way of designing or manufacturing a pro-  duct and, as such, o ers the potential to  overtake the competition, especially in  emerging markets where large, new capital  investments are required.  Finally, sustainable leadership is necessary  to give purpose and direction to proactive  environmental strategies. A vision of sus-  tainability is like a road map to the future,  sowing the way products and services must  evolve and what new competencies will be  needed to get there. Through stakeholder  communication, management commit-  ment, and articulation of future opportu-  nities, top management recognizes that  sustainable development can become a core  part of the company’s intent or long-term  vision. Taken together, clean technology  and sustainable leadership foster anticipa-  tion of tomorrow’s opportunities by posi-  tioning the firm to capture the products  and markets of the future.  In sum, di erentiation is the degree to  which the firm treats business and environ-  mental goals as separate; integration is the  degree to which the firm recognizes the  interconnected nature of environmental  and business goals, and anticipation is the  degree to which the firm sees future  opportunities in managing for environ-  mental sustainability.  RESULTS  The results of the CER analysis are pre-  sented in Table 2. We rated each of the  reports along the dimensions described  above, then constructed scores for the com-  panies’ di erentiation, integration, and  anticipation by aggregating the categories  that characterized each dimension. The  scales that we developed appear to have  measured the constructs as we had hoped,  as indicated by the correlation between dif-  ferentiation, integration, and anticipation.  Page 144  How Should Reputations be Managed in Good Times and Bad Times?  In general, companies that score highly on  measures of di erentiation have low scores  in both integration and anticipation.  Anticipation and integration are positively  correlated, which is in keeping with our  earlier definitions of the constructs, both of  which indicate a company has progressed  beyond end-of-pipe environmental solu-  tions.  The six firms in the chemical industry  exhibited much lower average di erentia-  tion than their counterparts in the petro-  leum industry. This supports our belief that  the chemical industry has moved beyond  the end-of-pipe mentality, while the petro-  leum industry lags behind in this regard.  We also observe a much stronger degree of  integration in the chemical firms. Their  average score on this construct was over 50  per cent higher than the oil companies’  score. Also, the chemical industry’s integra-  tion score was nearly double its di erentia-  tion score, while the petroleum companies  had, on average, higher di erentiation  results.  If we look more closely at the results  within the industries, another interesting  story emerges. For the chemical companies  with the ‘highest of the high’ environmen-  tal reputations (Du Pont, Dow and Mon-  santo), the configuration of environmental  strategies was even more striking. Each of  these companies had an integration score  that exceeded their di erentiation score by  at least 50 per cent. In the petroleum indus-  try, the top three reputation forms  (Amoco, Shell, and Chevron) had the  lowest integration scores in their industry.  CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION  We explored the link between the manage-  ment stance that firms take and their cor-  porate reputation, using the example of  environmental management. We found  visible di erences in the way environmen-  tal management practices were represented  by the most highly-reputed firms in the  chemical industry compared with their  counterparts in the oil industry.  Why should strong environmental repu-  tations be built di erently in chemical  versus oil companies? One hypothesis is  that the context and expectation surround-  ing the issue of environmental manage-  ment varies considerably from one  industry to the next. Earlier, we discussed  the more proactive stance that chemical  firms took relative to the oil companies;  this di erence was reflected in the clear  pattern we observed in the CER analysis,  where we found chemical firms taking a  more integrated stance than their oil indus-  try counterparts.  Consistent with Granovetter’s (1985)  embeddedness theory, we therefore expect  the environmental management strategies  adopted by firms in these two industries to  di er because of the social and institutional  contexts they face. Industry context is  expected to a ect significantly the strate-  gies deemed appropriate to address firms’  environmental reputation challenge, as the  people within an industry share experience,  work collectively to solve problems, and  respond to stakeholders that place demands  on the industry as a whole. Industry-wide  groups charged with setting policies and  standards and policing violators provide  evidence of the shared nature of firms’  responses to environmental pressures in  both these industries.  Institutional theory o ers further expla-  nation as to why firms in a given industry  should act similarly; not only are organiza-  tions shaped by the context in which they  are embedded, but when faced with uncer-  tainty — a key feature of environmental  issues in both industries — organizations  tend to look to others for models of how  to respond to problems (DiMaggio and  Powell, 1983). Mimetic isomorphism  results in such cases: unsure of what to do  in the face of a new problem, one organi-  zation’s decision makers seek an apparently  Page 145  Part VI  successful organization in their industry  and emulate its practices.  We have become accustomed to think-  ing of reputation management as occurring  at the firm level, and much reputation  research is concerned with identifying a  link between reputation and firm perfor-  mance (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990;  Roberts and Dowling, this issue). Our pre-  liminary results, however, suggest that the  link between reputation and performance  may be more complicated than we had  previously believed. If firms’ strategies are  constrained by industry context, then a  high reputation may not automatically  result in strong financial performance. In  the present example, we believe that the  integrated perspective holds cost advan-  tages over the di erentiated strategy. Thus,  in the long run, we would expect to see  the chemical firms with strong environ-  mental reputations perform better relative  to their industry average than their coun-  terparts in the oil industry.  As we have stressed throughout this arti-  cle, our results are preliminary. Much  work must be one to explain the way  industry context shapes environmental  reputation management. Our findings,  however, suggest that the industry e ect is  powerful; firms construct reputations  according to the expectations of their sta-  keholders, and these expectations di er  from industry to industry. In future  research, we will explore the robustness of  these findings and discover how such con-  straints a ect the link between reputation  and financial performance.

Two-way mirroring: identity and reputation  when things go wrong  C.Marlene Fiol and Sarah Kovoor-Misra, University of Colorado at Denver  INTRODUCTION  The names Union Carbide, Texaco, Mitsu-  bishi, and Exxon evoke images of organi-  zations whose reputations have been  challenged. A look behind the organiza-  tional wall may also reveal a similar fate to  their identities. Both reputation and iden-  tity are definitions of organizations from  the perspectives of outsiders and insiders  respectively. What is the relationship  between them? How does the endurance of  one a ect the relative endurance of the  other?  This article studies the interactive  dynamics between reputation and identity  when an organization commits a discredit-  ing act and has been stigmatized. Histori-  cally, researchers have tended to view these  external and internal definitions as separate  phenomena. More recent research is begin-  ning to cross traditional boundaries and  explore the dynamic relationships between  them. For example, Dutton and Dukerich  (1991), in their landmark study of the Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey,  describe how insiders underwent a shift in  their identity in response to perceptions of  changing external stakeholder demands.  Elsbach and Kramer (1996) in their study  of organizational responses to changing  Business Week rankings, describe the meth-  ods used by business schools to manage  these challenges to their identity. Fombrun  (1996) also acknowledges the linkages  between reputation and identity by  describing identity as the ‘backbone’ of  reputation. However, even such recent  attempts to examine internal and external  interactions have not gone far enough in  fully describing the cyclical and reciprocal  processes that link them and influence their  definition and redefinition.  The aim of this article is to push back  the boundaries historically separating  research on organizational identity and  reputation in order to understand better  the interactions that shape both forms of  organizational definition. It focusses on  these interactions during times when orga-  nizational definitions are challenged. It also  explores the conditions that lead to more  or less endurance of these definitions and  how changes in one a ect the endurance of  the other. The underlying argument is that  identity and reputation are inextricably  linked in a two-way mirroring process that  is especially activated when either or both  are challenged.  The theoretical model, shown in Figure  1, describes how, once a discrediting event  occurs, cognitive categories of the percei-  vers influence the intensity and pervasive-  ness of stigma they attach to the  organization. The intensity and pervasive-  ness of perceived stigma creates more or  less pressure to alter an organization’s iden-  tity and reputation. In this context, internal  and external definitions collide and shape  each other. They collide through the pro-  jection, interpretation, and assimilation of  organizational images. Each element of the  model is discussed below.  PRESSURES TO CHANGE EXISTING  REPUTATION AND IDENTITY  Pressures to change organizational defini-  tions arise from numerous sources includ-  ing new product or market penetration,  Page 147  Part VI  changing stakeholder expectations, transi-  tions in organizational life cycles, and  unexpected performance patterns. This  article focusses on pressures that arise from  stakeholder perceptions of stigma when an  organization is associated with a discredit-  ing event. The event provides new infor-  mation about who the organization is and  what it stands for. The event and commu-  nications about the event signal that the  organization is capable of committing  unfavorable acts or handling situations in  unfavorable ways. Perceptions of stigma  by stakeholders creates a pressure to incor-  porate such information into existing defi-  nitions.  Stigma is the mark of societal disap-  proval given to those who are perceived to  be physically or socially inferior (Page,  1984). Stigma allows societies to define  what is normal and acceptable versus  abnormal and unacceptable. Such defini-  tions are important as they create social  order and stability, which are important  for the reduction of anxiety and the per-  ception that the world is a safe place in  which to operate (Berger and Luckmann,  1967).  Stigma varies on the dimensions of  intensity and pervasiveness. Intensity refers  to the depth of disapproval of the event  felt by critical stakeholders. Pervasiveness  refers to the breadth of stakeholders who  perceive the stigma. The actors or stake-  holders involved in the perception of  stigma are both internal and external.  Internal stakeholders include top manage-  ment and organizational employees. Exter-  nal stakeholders include suppliers,  financiers, governmental agencies, custo-  mers, activist groups, and the public at  large.  A number of factors potentially influence  the level of intensity and pervasiveness of  stigma. For example, the characteristics of  the discrediting event per se clearly have an  impact. This article, however, takes a cog-  nitive view of stigma development and its  Figure 1 Interactive Dynamics Between Reputation and Identity  Page 148  How Should Reputations be Managed in Good Times and Bad Times?  impact on organizational definition and  redefinition. We argue that individuals  view the event through societal, organiza-  tional and personal filters. Moreover, it is  these filters that enable individuals to assign  meaning to the event.  COGNITIVE FILTERS  The same discrediting event may look  very di erent to di erent audiences,  depending on how they ‘filter’ the event.  Filtering occurs through the use of cogni-  tive categories that all of us apply to  situations and events around us all of the  time to determine what is ‘right’ or  ‘wrong’, ‘expensive’ or cheap’, ‘young’ or  ‘old’, and so on. Though often uncon-  scious of it, we fragment the world into  cognitive categories in order to simplify  and make sense of it (Bruner, 1957;  Corter and Gluck, 1992).  Organizational stakeholders use societal,  organizational and personal filters to view  a discrediting event. Societal filters enable  perceivers to determine how discrediting  an event is, based on widely-held social  norms. Organizational filters of prior repu-  tation or identity enable individuals to  assess the consistency between present and  past behaviors, leading to di ering percep-  tions of stigma. Finally, the extent to  which perceivers use existing definitions of  an organization to define themselves,  results in di erent levels of stigma attached  to an event. For example, one would  expect top management to minimize  stigma when their personal reputations are  tightly coupled with the organization.  INTERACTIVE DYNAMICS BETWEEN  REPUTATION AND IDENTITY  As stigma develops, internal and external  definitions collide and shape each other.  This occurs as insiders and outsiders signal,  interpret, and assimilate organizational  images. The article examines these pro-  cesses as they occur in the interactions  between insiders and outsiders, though the  processes also occur between insiders and  between outsiders.  Signaling Images  Signaling between insiders and outsiders  increases in intensity during times of  upheaval. As a result, after a discrediting  event, the intensity of signaling increases as  outsiders express their disapproval and insi-  ders seek to manage perceptions of stigma.  Outsiders express their disapproval primar-  ily through various forms of sent stigmas  (Page, 1984). These signals can take the  form of denigration, decreased participa-  tion or rejection (Sutton and Callahan,  1987). Such signals communicate to insi-  ders how outsiders perceive the organiza-  tion.  Insiders signal to outsiders through  stigma management and impression man-  agement techniques in order to present  themselves in the best possible light (Go -  man, 1963; Page, 1984; Sutton & Calla-  han, 1987). In this process, the existing  identity of the organization cognitively  constrains the types of signals that are  sent. For example, an organization that  has an identity as a caring place, in the  context of employee deaths from a plant  explosion, may intentionally highlight its  history of caring for its employees to  explain that it would not have jeopardized  their safety. Organizations, through their  actions, may also unintentionally reveal  how they perceive themselves. For exam-  ple, the New York and New Jersey Port  Authority, by involving more police to  manage the homeless problem, signaled  that they did not perceive themselves as  being in the social service business (Dutton  and Dukerich, 1991). Thus, the images  that are projected by organizations, even  though they are similar attempts to frame  the organization in the best possible light,  reflect the di erent ways the organization  perceives itself.  Page 149  Part VI  Interpreting Images  Though images are ‘out there’ as concrete  and external manifestations of people’s  mental pictures, they are subject to inter-  pretive processes. Images of organizations  can be interpreted numerous ways —  much like the interpretations of discredit-  ing events — again depending on people’s  cognitive filters. Both insiders and outsiders  will use societal filters to assess the appro-  priateness of signal content and intensity.  Also, cognitive filters will influence the  extent to which the perceiver will be open  to acknowledging the signaled stigma.  Finally, the perceiver will turn to existing  organizational definitions to assess consis-  tency and relevance. Those signals that are  consistent with what the perceiver already  believes about the organization will be  viewed with credibility. Those signals that  pertain to those attributes of the organiza-  tion that are neither central nor distinctive  will be discounted.  Assimilation of Images  The signals and their interpretations com-  municate to insiders and outsiders the  perception of the other. The extent to  which such information will be assimi-  lated is dependent on two factors: the  extent to which it confirms existing defi-  nitions, and the intensity of perceived  stigma. Information that is perceived to  be consistent with existing definitions will  not be resisted, because it is perceived as  credible. Thus, organizations with nega-  tive reputations will incorporate negative  attributes more readily and those with  positive reputations will resist assimilation  of the stigma.  However, even organizations with posi-  tive reputations are vulnerable in situations  of intense stigma. This is because perceivers  who view the organization with stigma  signal intensively and strive to reduce  ambiguity about the intentionality and role  of the organization. As the ambiguity is  reduced and stakeholders begin to accept  the validity of the stigma, their prior defi-  nitions can no longer resist the pressures,  and assimilation begins. As insiders and  outsiders assimilate the signals sent by the  other, they incorporate the content of the  other’s definition into their own. It is in  this way that reputation and identity shape  each other.  Assimilation can change the structure  and content of existing definitions in a  number of ways. For example, the struc-  ture of organizational definitions can  change either in the birth of new defini-  tions or in the fusion of existing defini-  tions. Also, the content of existing  definitions can be changed either in provid-  ing greater definition to existing definitions  or in redefining the content.  The relationship between signaling,  interpretation, and assimilation is cyclical  and reciprocal. Signaling and interpretation  processes provide new information about  the organization. The assimilation of this  information may result in changes to exist-  ing definitions which, in turn, influences  future signaling and interpretation. Signal-  ing will continue until both parties feel  that further signaling serves no purpose.  IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND  MANAGEMENT  Researchers have tended to study reputa-  tion and identity as separate phenomena.  This article describes the interactive  dynamics between them, illustrating how  essential one is for understanding and  managing the other. The most fundamen-  tal contribution of this study is the under-  lying proposition that reputations and  identities are shaped by each other. This  has important research implications. First,  it means that a focus on one or the other in  isolation can only provide a static snapshot  of one moment of organizational defini-  tion. Secondly, focussing separately on  how insiders or outsiders define an organi-  Page 150  How Should Reputations be Managed in Good Times and Bad Times?  zation leads to an understanding of a label  that is the outcome of a negotiated process.  It says little about the forces that led to  such a definition. If the aim of the research  is to understand better the reasons for par-  ticular organizational definitions and their  changes, it must address the manner in  which reputation and identity interact.  This study also has a number of implica-  tions for practice in terms of preparation  for, containment of, and recovery from, a  discrediting event. The most important  implication is that the management of  stigma begins long before stigmatization  occurs. Since things will ‘go wrong’ at  some point, it is critical that managers con-  sciously prepare for the eventuality by con-  sistently signaling strong and positive  images of themselves.  In terms of stigma containment, man-  agers need to pay close attention to the sig-  naling, interpretation, and assimilation  processes that occur. Also, in recovering  from a stigmatized event, organizations  that have had their definitions most chan-  ged in terms of structure and content will  have to invest in recovery activities in  terms of rebuilding both internal and  external commitment to the organization.  CONCLUSION  In conclusion, both reputation and identity  are important definitions of organizations.  They remain loosely coupled in times of  stability and become more tightly coupled  in times of upheaval. Reputation and iden-  tity are two sides of the same coin.  Acknowledging one definition and ignor-  ing the other leaves one blind to the deeper  dynamics that influence these definitions.  REFERENCES  Berger, P.L. and Luckmann, T.

Dukerich, University of Texas at Austin  INTRODUCTION  Firms compete for reputational status on a  daily basis. Certainly not every firm can  win this fight, and consequently, many  firms find that their reputations sometimes  su er. How do organizational members  react when their firm is confronted with a  downturn in reputation? Using insights  gained from impression management lit-  erature, we present a model that attempts  to predict how members of an organiza-  tion will act in response to a decrease in  the firm’s reputation, in order to manage  future impressions of the firm. We argue  that a decrease in corporate reputation, for  whatever reason, is likely to motivate  organizational members to manage their  organization’s image di erently than they  would otherwise deem necessary. That is,  if the organization has a decrease in repu-  tation, organizational members may feel a  strong need to improve this image  through the use of defensive reputation  management actions. The available  impression management techniques may  result in observable organizational beha-  vior in the form of press releases, advertis-  ing, or contributions to charitable  organizations (Fombrun and Shanley,  1990; Russ, 1991). Figure 1 illustrates a  causal model of a firm’s potential tactical-  defensive behaviors.  Figure 1 The Process of Tactical-Defensive Behaviors in Organizations  Page 152  How Should Reputations be Managed in Good Times and Bad Times?  SPECIFIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE  ORGANIZATION  Press releases  Elsbach and Sutton (1992) found evidence  that Earth First! and ACT UP spokesper-  sons tended to use tactical-defensive actions  such as denying, justifying, and then later  apologizing if necessary, to justify actions  under scrutiny by the public and to  improve the legitimacy of their organiza-  tions. It appears that organizational mem-  bers attempt to change the public’s view of  the firm’s reputation by relying on press  releases to the public that attempt to justify  or excuse the organization for its actions. If  these justifications are not accepted by the  public, the firm may focus its press releases  on disclaimers or apologies (Tedeschi and  Melburg, 1984). On the other hand, orga-  nizations with positive reputations have no  need to act defensively, thus, press releases  are unnecessary mechanisms for enhancing  reputation.  Hypothesis 1: Organizations that have  undergone recent downturns in their  reputations will increase the number of  press releases (as compared to the  previous year) more than those organi-  zations with unchanged or improved  reputations.  Advertising  Firms have used advertising successfully  when attempting to apologize for undesir-  able actions. We predict that organizational  members will attempt to use advertising to  enhance corporate reputation and this will  be more likely if the firm has had a recent  decrease in reputation, because this unfa-  vorable reputation is an impetus for action.  Hypothesis 2: Organizations that have  undergone recent downturns in their  reputations will increase their advertising  expenditures (as compared to the  previous year) more than those organi-  zations with unchanged or improved  reputations.  Charitable Contributions  If management’s attempts to deny or apol-  ogize prove ine ective to managing the  organization’s reputation, they may  attempt to use other tactics. A possible  alternative for the organization would be  to attempt to compensate for its perceived  negative behavior by restitution. For  example, Dow Corning, in a concerted  e ort to save its reputation during the sili-  cone breast implant crisis situation, o ered  additional money for research and financial  support for women interested in removing  the breast implants (Power, 1992). Another  possible method for providing restitution is  to donate money to charitable organiza-  tions that may be particularly concerned  with the actions of the organization. The  impression management literature suggests  that organizational members in firms with  falling reputations may attempt to reduce  the negative aspects of their firm’s reputa-  tion by restitution tactics, such as contri-  buting to charitable causes.  Hypothesis 3: Organisations that have  undergone recent downturns in their  reputations will increase their charitable  contributions (as compared to the  previous year) more than those organi-  zations with unchanged or improved  reputations.  METHODOLOGY  In order to test the hypotheses developed  in this article, it was essential to find a  sample that allowed us to directly measure  corporate reputation and changes to repu-  tation over time. It was determined that  Fortune’s Most Admired Survey provided  such information because this survey is  conducted and presented annually and the  results are widely circulated and cited in  the popular press. A sample of 119 firms  Page 153  Part VI  over a four-year period from 1989 to 1992  was selected, resulting in 476 firm-year  data points.  Definition and measurement of variables  The reputation score reported in Fortune’s  issue of the Most Admired firms was  selected for our analysis because it is a  widely-known measure of reputation and  is therefore likely to be the strongest indi-  cator of changes in reputation management  activities. Two control variables were used:  size of firm, measured as the logarithmic  transformation of total sales lagged by one  year, and industry, divided into four eco-  nomic sectors.  The dependent variables include change  in advertising expenditures, charitable con-  tributions, and press releases. A measure of  the number of press releases a firm issues in  a given year is based on the number of  press releases reported by the two major  sources of wire services, PR Newswire,  and Business Wire as reported on LEXIS/  NEXIS. COMPUSTAT was used to col-  lect advertising expenditure data. Data for  charitable contributions were obtained  from ‘Corporate 500: Directory of Corpo-  rate Philanthropy’ (Public Management  Institute) and the ‘TAFT Corporate Giving  Directory’ (Taft Group, Inc.).  ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  In order to determine if significant di er-  ences existed between firms with favorable  and unfavorable changes in reputations on  the variables of interest, pooled cross-sec-  tional time-series analyses were conducted.  Table 1 contains the regression models pre-  dicting change in press releases, advertising  and charitable contributions.  Change in press releases  Hypothesis 1 predicted that firms would  increase their use of press releases if their  reputation decreased. As Table 1 shows,  first of all, there was a significant positive  relationship between press releases and the  previous period’s reputation. That is, high  reputation firms tend to issue more press  releases than low reputation firms on aver-  age. However, the e ect of change in repu-  tation on change in press releases was  significant and in the predicted direction  (p<.0.5). That is firms that have had a  decrease in their reputation tend to increase  their use of press releases. Thus, Hypothesis  1 was supported.  Change in advertising  Hypothesis 2 was concerned with advertis-  ing expenditures. As indicated by Table 1  again, high reputation firms tend to use  advertising to a greater extent than low  reputation firms. The relationship between  change in reputation and advertising was  again in the predicted direction, but in this  case was not significant. Therefore,  Hypothesis 2, while providing evidence  that the relationship as hypothesized may  exist, was not supported.  Change in charitable contributions  Hypothesis 3 dealt with charitable contri-  butions. As indicated by Table 1 and con-  sistent with the other models, high  reputation firms tend to donate more  money to charities than do low reputation  firms. However, the change variable was  found to be positive and significant —  opposite the direction predicted in  Hypothesis 3 (p<0.5). That is, it appears  that positive changes in reputation are asso-  ciated with increases in future charitable  contributions. Therefore, Hypothesis 3 was  not supported.  DISCUSSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS  The finding that high reputation firms tend  to utilise more impression management  techniques, in the form of press releases,  advertising and charitable contributions, is  consistent with earlier findings (Fombrun  Page 154  How Should Reputations be Managed in Good Times and Bad Times?  and Shanley, 1990) that constituents find  these activities to be important to the  establishment of a good reputation. What  our research adds, however, is empirical  support that reputation changes provide  organizational members with incentives to  change the organization’s reputation man-  agement activities. First of all, the finding  that decreases in reputation leads to an  increase in the number of press releases  supports the notion that organizational  members may try to justify, excuse or  apologize for the organization’s recent  negative changes. The prediction that  negative changes to reputation would  increase advertising was not supported,  although the coe cient was in the pre-  dicted direction. Our lower sample size for  this model, due to lack of data on advertis-  ing expenditures, could have limited our  ability to find significant results with this  model.  Finally, the finding of a positive relation-  ship between change in reputation and  change in charitable contributions suggests  that firms may consider a donation to char-  ity as a strategic rather than a tactical  action. It is possible that firms do not con-  sider that a negative change in reputation  can benefit from an immediate increase in  Table 1: The Impact of Change in Reputation on Change in Reputation Management  Activities  Variable Press Releases Advertising Charitable  Contributions  Press releases  t–1  0.871*** 0.760*** 0.641***  (0.037) (0.045) (0.059)  Sales  t–1  0.093** 0.326*** 0.410***  (0.037) (0.075) (0.092)  Industry 1 0.207 –0.994** 0.572  (0.172) (0.376) (0.517)  Industry 2 0.014 0.408* 0.039  (0.101) (0.169) (0.179)  Industry 4 –0.155 0.229 –0.008  (0.154) (0.195) (0.220)  Reputation  t–1  0.058** 0.087* 0.220***  (0.028) (0.041) (0.056)  Change in reputation –0.141* –0.162 0.304*  (0.084) (0.129) (0.141)  Constant –0.719* –2.640*** –2.039**  (0.387) (0.643) (0.718)  Adjusted R  2  0.766 0.928 0.800  Change in R  2  from  control model  a  F  (2, 271)  =5.21*** F  (2, 143)  =6.56*** F  (2, 137)  =5.14***  Nonstandardized regression coe cients are shown.

It may be the case  that the funding typically used for charita-  ble contributions is funneled o  to other  defensive type activities, which may have a  more immediate e ect on the firm’s future  reputation. Future research should attempt  to examine longer-term strategic responses  available to firms to enhance their reputa-  tion. Many of the responses, such as  increased e orts to improve product qual-  ity through higher research and develop-  ment funding, are particularly critical to  the formation of a corporate reputation  and its stability over time.  CONCLUSION  This article has explored potential actions  taken by members of an organization due  to its current corporate reputation. These  actions may take di erent forms depending  on the reputation held by the organization.  Whether tactical or strategic, actions taken  to either maintain or improve the corpo-  rate reputation of the firm are a signal to  the public of a firm’s need to establish or  enhance its reputation. This research is an  attempt to gain a better understanding of  how elements of corporate reputation may  a ect actions taken by members of an  organization.  REFERENCES  Elsbach, K. and Sutton, R.

INDUSTRIAL TRAINING IN THE NETHERLANDS; A COMPARISON WITH SOME OTHER EC COUNTRIES 19   A framework is presented within which differences in industrial training partici pation rates can be analysed.   Industrial   Training in The   Netherlands:   A Comparison with   Some Other   EC Countries   Mark J.A.M. Aalders and Frans A.J. van den Bosch   Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 15 No. 6, 1991, pp. 19-22,   © MCB University Press, 0309-0590   Industrial training can be investigated at different levels   of analysis: at the macro level (country studies); at the   meso level (industries) and at the micro level (enterprises).   It is well known that differences exist in industrial training   participation rates between countries and within countries;   between, for example, small and medium-sized firms.   However, it is less known that substantial differences exist   in industrial training participation rates at the meso level.   This article focuses on the meso level especially with   respect to analysing differences in industrial training   participation rates and costs by industry. By analysing   these differences more insight can be gained into different   approaches to training and the underlying trends and   tendencies affecting the training function.   In the first section some research results for a number   of European countries will be discussed. The second   section presents the main findings of the first integral   statistical survey of industrial training in The Netherlands,   published in 1988. In the third section we introduce and   discuss a general framework for explaining differences in   industrial training participation rates per industry. The   fourth section contains the first results of the application   of this framework to Dutch data followed by a summary   and conclusions.   Industrial Training in European Countries   The growing attention for industrial training has resulted   in an increasing number of publications on training activities   in organisations, both by international and by national   agencies. Influenced by rising unemployment, the OECD   paid increasing attention to the role of enterprises in the   educational system[l]. Only in a limited sense did this   increased attention result in comparative studies between   member states on the size and structure of these   activities. The OECD limited themselves to appren   ticeships and governmental employment policies.   In the European Community, research has been taking   place into vocational training systems in the member   countries as well. This research has been undertaken by   the European Centre for the Development of Vocational   Training (CEDEFOP) and is aimed at the mutual   recognition of certificates. However, not much attention   has been paid to training activities in enterprises. In the   extensive study on vocational training systems in the   Community[2] only a few pages were spent on the subject   of industrial training. This first observation reveals that   these activities differ a great deal between countries. In   Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Italy and Luxembourg   vocational training is mainly undertaken by schools or other   government-supported institutes. In West Germany,   France and The Netherlands the enterprises are primarily   involved in vocational training, whereas the UK has a   mixed system. The financing of vocational training also   differs between countries. In Italy and Luxembourg the   government plays a big role, while in Denmark, Great   Britain and The Netherlands the costs of industrial training   are borne by industry itself. A further comparison between   the systems is not made.   Eurostat — the statistical office of the Community —   systematically collects information on the costs of industrial   training. This is done by a survey on the structure of the   total labour costs in the member states. Part of the survey   is directed at the costs of industrial training (excluding the   costs of working hours spent on training). (See Table I.)   It appears that there are remarkable differences in   industrial training, both between countries and between   industrial sectors in a country. More information on   industrial training can only be found in studies undertaken   in various countries themselves[4], or in some general   surveys[5]. Substantial differences between countries in   the extent of industrial training are noticed. However, until   now an explanation for these differences has been lacking.   20 JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL JOURNAL 15,6   Table I.

The organisational structure of training at   industry level, "make, buy or co-operate" questions with   respect to training activities, the influences of business   environment and the industry structure, etc., get little   interest. This lack of interest at meso level is remarkable.   The work of Porter[ll] concerning the competitiveness   of nations stresses the importance of a sectoral analysis,   in which education and training play a major role.   Industrial Training in The Netherlands: Recent   Data at Industry level   In The Netherlands the most extensive survey on   industrial training was undertaken by the Central Bureau   of Statistics[12]. Some results will be presented briefly   here. The survey population consists of all companies and   institutions with five or more employees, with the   exception of governmental institutions and the education   and health systems. Apprenticeships are also excluded.   There are 3 million employees in the population (two-thirds   of the total workforce).   Table II shows that the participation rate is on average   25 per cent. However, substantial differences exist   between, on the one hand, small firms (5-100 employees)   with a participation rate of 10 per cent and, on the other,   large firms (over 500 employees) with a participation rate   of 46 per cent. The total cost to the employers was 2.3   billion Dutch guilders, including the cost of working hours   spent on training (this contrary to the Eurostat survey).   In relative terms this means that the cost of training   amounts to 1.5 per cent of all wage costs.   Table II. Industrial Training in The Netherlands:   Participation Rates and Costs (1986)*   Participation rate   (in % employees)   Costs   (in % wage costs)   Size of firms (employees)   5-100 100-500 >500 Total   (%) (%) (%) (%)   10 25 46 25   0.5 1.2 2.9 1.5   * Excluding the public sector and firms with less than five   employees.   Source: [13].   Both participation rates and costs differ remarkably by   industry. In Table III it can be seen that the banking sector   has a participation rate which is almost twice as high (45   per cent) as the total average. Construction, on the other   hand, has the lowest participation rate (8 per cent), one-  third of the average. External training (outside the firm)   accounts for 40 per cent of the total. In small firms this   percentage is 67 per cent, while of the larger firms 34   per cent contracts training activities from outside the firm.   Further, it appears that one-third of the training activities   is provided by industry-level institutes. Small firms make   twice as much use of these institutes (46 per cent) than   the large firms (23 per cent). The findings of this recent   survey are confirmed by other Dutch research[14,15,16].

INDUSTRIAL TRAINING IN THE NETHERLANDS; A COMPARISON WITH SOME OTHER EC COUNTRIES 21   Some interesting phenomena emerge from this research;   phenomena which ask for a further explanation. What   especially attracts attention are the large differences   between the industrial sectors. However, little is known   about the factors which cause these differences in   participation rates between sectors. A framework of   analysis will be presented next, in which the factors that   can explain these differences will be discussed.   A Framework of Analysis   Earlier research stemming from different disciplines   suggests that many factors are involved in explaining the   intensity of training activities and the differences in   intensity between industrial sectors. In our view a   multidisciplinary framework of analysis is necessary. That   is why we have tried to marshal these factors by   distinguishing four groups of explanatory factors, partly   influencing each other, partly independent of each other.   These are:   (1) the industry structure;   (2) the business environment;   (3) the structure of industrial training programmes   (with respect to organisation and finance), and   (4) industrial relations in the sector.   In Table IV the industrial training participation rate — as   the variable to be explained — is linked to the four groups   of explaining variables.   Industry Structure   First, there are the factors related to the structure of the   industrial sector. The main factors are the number and   size of the firms, and the homogeneity of the production   process.   Business Environment   There are at least four explanatory factors which can be   headed under the business environment. Government   policies play an important role in this group. With regard   to public policy, it seems that the nature and the range   of educational (which must be seen as broader than initial   education) and training facilities offered by the government   are of great importance. The more these public provisions   meet the needs of the industry, and especially of all the   employing organisations, the less need there is for private   facilities.   Technological developments, often having an impact on   more than one industrial sector, can have consequences   for the amount and qualifications of labour needed.   Demographical and market development can also cause   discrepancies between the firm's demand for labour   qualifications, on one side, and the supply of labour   qualifications of the firm's employees on the other. These   discrepancies can be reduced by improving the   qualifications of the internal labour supply, or by appealing   Table IV. A Framework for Explaining Differences in   Industrial Training Participalion Rates   between Industries   Variable to be explained   Differences in industrial   training participation   rates by industry   1.   2.   3.   4.   Explanatory factors   Industry structure:   Number and size of firms   Homogeneity production   process   Business environment:   Technological development   Labour market development   Market growth   Government policies   Structure of industrial training   programmes:   Organisational structure   Financial structure   Industrial relations:   Support by social partners   to the external labour market, or by substitution of labour   by capital (depending on the relative prices), or by   contracting out activities to other firms or industries and   decreasing the number of one's own employees.   Moreover, the decision to provide for the aforementioned   discrepancies "internally" and/or "externally" does not   make the explanation of the extent of industrial training   much easier. More generally the question that arises is   a "make, co-operate or buy" decision.   Organisation and Finance   A third group of explanatory variables are the factors   related to the organisational and financial structure of   industrial training. With respect to organisational structure,   an interesting question is, for instance, the choice between   internal or external provision of industrial training. And,   related to this is the question whether or not to co-operate   with other firms in the same industry. With respect to   the financing of industrial training, the question arises as   to how funds should be raised and whether the costs   should be divided among the parties involved: employers,   employees, industry-level institutes and other parties (e.g.   the government). In this connection the possibility of the   so-called prisoners' dilemma is interesting. If each   individual enterprise withholds from training activities and   tries to take advantage of the investment in training by   other enterprises in the industry, a stalemate can arise,   which, if seen from an industry level, can be suboptimal.   Industrial Relations   Lastly, industrial relations can have a large impact on   realising training activities. Support by the social partners   (labour unions and employers) seems to be essential to   ensure that training activities at industrial level become   a success.   22 JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL JOURNAL 15,6   Preliminary Results   Until recently little research had been undertaken to   investigate the factors behind the differences in training   intensity with respect to industries. As we have seen,   some factors can be mentioned which might contribute   to an explanation of this phenomenon — one thinks of   capital intensity, R&D expenditures, number and average   size of firms in the industry, average level of education   of the employees, the existence of collective labour   agreements, and industry level institutes. These factors   all can be placed in the framework presented here.   For The Netherlands, Boot and Jansen[17] recently   investigated whether some of these factors can indeed   explain the existence of substantial differences in   participation rates between industries. It appears that   differing average educational levels and differing levels of   automation (partly a proxy for technological development)   and the degree of concentration in an industry can explain   about half of the variety in participation rates. In our   opinion, part of this variety could be explained if   differences with respect to the organisational and financial   structures of training were included. This can be done   on the basis of a recent survey held in The Netherlands   on institutes at industry level. These institutes engage   in industrial training. When we compare the results of this   survey with those of the earlier mentioned CBS survey   it appears that industries which have well-functioning and   jointly financed industry-level institutes specialising in   industrial training have high participation rates in industrial   training (e.g. insurance, printing industry) as well.   Whereas industries with little co-operation in training   (excluding apprenticeships) and financing of these   activities, such as textiles, construction and trade, account   for low participation rates in industrial training.   Summary and Conclusion   This article focuses on the substantial differences in   industrial training participation rates at industry level.   Although the research effort aimed at explaining these   differences is growing, a comprehensive multidisciplinary   framework for analysis is missing. In this article such a   framework is proposed and discussed. The preliminary   results of the application of the framework stress, beside   other factors, the importance of the organisational and   financial structure of industrial training activities. Further   research into this field can result — within a comparative   setting — in more insight into different approaches to   training and the underlying tendencies affecting the training   function.

Although the   expenditure on training (£14.4 billion) is much higher than   in The Netherlands, this is partly due to the inclusion of   vocational training for youths, public sector training and a   broader definition of on-the-job training. The number of days   of training per employee is exactly the same (7 days per   year). There also exists a remarkable resemblance in the   ranking of industrial sectors in the pattern of training levels   (see for instance the report Employers' Activities, p. 19) and   the internal and external causes and constraints behind   training (see for instance the report Employers' Perspectives   on Human Resources, pp. 32, 52).   5.

Investigating Managers’ Exploration and Exploitation  Activities: The Influence of Top-Down, Bottom-Up,  and Horizontal Knowledge Inflows*  Tom J. M. Mom, Frans A. J. Van Den Bosch and  Henk W. Volberda  RSM Erasmus University  abstract This paper develops and tests hypotheses on the influence of managers’ knowledge  inflows on managers’ exploration and exploitation activities. Based on a survey among  managers of a leading electronics firm, the findings indicate, as expected, that top-down  knowledge inflows of managers positively relate to the extent to which these managers  conduct exploitation activities, while they do not relate to managers’ exploration activities.  Furthermore, as expected, bottom-up and horizontal knowledge inflows of managers positively  relate to these managers’ exploration activities, while they do not relate to managers’  exploitation activities. We contribute to current literature on exploration and exploitation by  focusing on the manager level of analysis, and by adding the importance of knowledge flow  configurations to studies which investigate the impact of organizational factors on exploration  and exploitation.  INTRODUCTION  Firms in a dynamic environment are challenged to both explore new possibilities in order  to cope with future changes in the business environment and to exploit old certainties to  meet today’s business demands (March, 1991). Previous research suggests, however, that  firms face difficulties to both explore and exploit; current literature and management  practice could benefit from increased understanding about how firms may manage both  exploration and exploitation (cf. Benner and Tushman, 2003; Gibson and Birkinshaw,  2004; Levinthal and March, 1993; Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996).  This paper aims to contribute to this by investigating managers’ exploration activities  such as searching for, discovering, creating, and experimenting with new opportunities  (cf. March, 1991, p. 71), and managers’ exploitation activities such as selecting, imple-  menting, improving and refining existing certainties (cf. March, 1991, p. 71).

Journal of Management Studies 44:6 September 2007  doi: 10.1111/j.1467-6486.2007.00697.x  and exploitation are typically studied at the firm-level (e.g. Benner and Tushman, 2002,  2003; He and Wong, 2004) or at the business unit-level (e.g. Gibson and Birkinshaw,  2004; Jansen et al., 2006). However, there is a lack of conceptually and empirically  validated understanding about exploration and exploitation at the manager level of  analysis. This is quite surprising as previous research in organizational learning (Crossan  et al., 1999; Dyck et al., 2005; Vera and Crossan, 2004), strategy research (Burgelman,  1983b, 1991; Floyd and Lane, 2000; Rajagopalan and Spreitzer, 1996; Rosenbloom,  2000; Tripsas and Gavetti, 2000) and technological innovation (Duncan, 1976;  Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996) indicates that firm or unit level exploration and exploi-  tation to a large extent originate in the exploration and exploitation activities of their  managers. These studies indicate that insight into managers’ exploration and exploita-  tion activities and into how these activities may be influenced, benefit our understanding  about how to build exploration and exploitation within a business-unit or firm.  Taking a knowledge perspective (Grant, 1996; Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000; Kogut  and Zander, 1992; Schulz, 2001), this paper investigates how the acquisition of knowl-  edge from other persons and/or units in the same organization by a manager, influence  this manager’s exploration and exploitation activities. On the basis of studies of intra-  organizational knowledge flows (Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000; Schulz, 2003), we will  conceptualize and operationalize knowledge acquisition by a manager in terms of a  manager’s knowledge inflows. Previous research indicates that knowledge acquisition is  an important explanatory factor for exploration as well as exploitation related activities  within a firm. In the area of technological innovation, scholars have examined the impact  of knowledge acquisition by firms, as reflected in citation patterns within patent appli-  cations, in terms of the extent to which innovations tend to be incremental or radical (e.g.  Katila and Ahuja, 2002; Nerkar, 2003; Rosenkopf and Nerkar, 2001). Studies in the field  of organizational learning indicate that the acquisition of knowledge is a primary mecha-  nism by which not only firms but also organization members learn from each other (Fiol  and Lyles, 1985; Huber, 1991; Levitt and March, 1988). Such learning through the  acquisition of knowledge may be either exploratory (e.g. Inkpen, 1996; Nonaka, 1994),  and/or exploitative (Adler et al., 1999; Levin, 2000).  With respect to managers, previous conceptual investigations and case studies in the  field of strategy research indicate that exploration and exploitation related activities of  managers are facilitated by vertical knowledge flows, i.e. by managers’ top-down and/or  bottom-up knowledge inflows (Burgelman, 1983b, 1991; Floyd and Lane, 2000; Rivkin  and Siggelkow, 2003; Van Cauwenbergh and Cool, 1982). Others point to the important  role of horizontal knowledge flows within an organization with regard to understanding  exploration and exploitation related activities (e.g. Gupta and Govindarajan, 1991;  Mom et al., 2005; Nonaka, 1994; Schulz, 2003; Subramaniam and Youndt, 2005).  Therefore, we will investigate not only top-down and bottom-up knowledge inflows but  also horizontal knowledge inflows of managers. More specifically, we will focus on the  following research question: how do top-down, bottom-up, and horizontal knowledge  inflows of managers affect their exploration activities and exploitation activities?  This paper has three contributions. First, it delivers a contribution to the current  literature on exploration and exploitation (e.g. Benner and Tushman, 2002; Gibson and  Birkinshaw, 2004; He and Wong, 2004; March, 1991; Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996)  Managers’ Exploration and Exploitation Activities 911  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007  which lacks conceptually and empirically validated understanding about exploration and  exploitation at the level of the manager by examining managers’ exploration and exploi-  tation activities. We also developed scales which assess managers’ levels of exploration  and exploitation as such scales were not available yet. Second, the paper adds the  importance of knowledge flow configurations to studies which investigate the impact of  organizational factors on exploration and exploitation (e.g. Adler et al., 1999; Benner  and Tushman, 2002, 2003; Ghemawat and Ricart I Costa, 1993; Gibson and Birkin-  shaw, 2004; Jansen et al., 2006; Leana and Barry, 2000; McGrath, 2001; Rivkin and  Siggelkow, 2003; Sheremata, 2000; Van Den Bosch et al., 1999). By developing and  testing a framework, we contribute to the understanding of how knowledge inflows of  managers influence their exploration and exploitation activities. Third, the paper also  contributes to strategy process research (e.g. Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1993; Floyd and  Lane, 2000; Van Cauwenbergh and Cool, 1982). Whereas the vertical exchange of  knowledge between managers plays an important role in studies of strategy process  research, to our knowledge, quantitative empirical studies seem to be lacking. Moreover,  this paper illustrates the role of horizontal knowledge flows as well.  The paper is structured as follows. The next section presents the theoretical back-  ground of the paper. It delves into the concepts of exploration, exploitation, and knowl-  edge inflows at the manager level, and it examines how intra-organizational knowledge  inflows of a manager affect this manager’s level of exploration and exploitation. After  advancing the hypotheses, the method section provides details about the sample, data  collection, and the development and validation of the measurement instruments. Next,  we present the empirical findings and conclude with a discussion of the results, implica-  tions, and issues for further research.  THEORY AND HYPOTHESES  Exploration and Exploitation at the Manager Level  This study departs from March (1991) by conceptualizing exploration and exploitation  at the manager level. March (1991, p. 71) considers the relation between exploration,  which includes ‘things captured by terms such as search, variation, risk taking, experi-  mentation, play, flexibility, discovery, innovation’, and exploitation, which includes ‘such  things as refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, execu-  tion’ in organizational learning. Studies of organizational learning indicate that the  essence of exploration activities is creating variety in experience (Bontis et al., 2002; Holm-  qvist, 2004; Levinthal and March, 1993; McGrath, 2001) which is associated with  broadening a manager’s existing knowledge base (cf. Katila and Ahuja, 2002; Levinthal  and March, 1993; Sidhu et al., 2004). Such exploration activities of managers include  searching for new organizational norms, routines, structures, and systems (Crossan et al.,  1999; Nooteboom, 2000; Zollo and Winter, 2002), experimenting with new approaches  towards technologies, business processes, or markets (McGrath, 2001), innovating and  adopting a long-term orientation (Duncan, 1976; Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996), and  reconsidering existing beliefs and decisions (Floyd and Lane, 2000; Ghemawat and  Ricart I Costa, 1993; Rivkin and Siggelkow, 2003). The essence of exploitation activities is  T. J. M. Mom et al.912  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007  creating reliability in experience (Bontis et al., 2002; Holmqvist, 2004; Levinthal and  March, 1993) which is associated with deepening a manager’s existing knowledge base  (cf. Katila and Ahuja, 2002; Levinthal and March, 1993). Such exploitation activities of  managers include using and refining their existing knowledge (Levinthal and March,  1993), applying, improving, and extending existing competences, technologies, processes  and products (March, 1991), focusing on production and adopting a rather short-term  orientation (Duncan, 1976; Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996), and elaborating on existing  beliefs and decisions (Floyd and Lane, 2000; Ghemawat and Ricart I Costa, 1993; Rivkin  and Siggelkow, 2003).  Knowledge Inflows  Concepts such as knowledge sharing, knowledge exchange, and knowledge flows are  sometimes used interchangeably in studies (cf. Schulz, 2001). However, whereas  knowledge sharing and knowledge exchange imply a reciprocal relationship in terms of  transfers of knowledge, the concept of knowledge flows allows greater precision about  the directionality of the knowledge being transferred. That is, knowledge outflows are  associated with a donor providing a recipient with knowledge, where the knowledge  donor is the focal unit of analysis (Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000; Schulz, 2001).  Schulz (2001), for instance, investigated among others the impact of exploration and  exploitation learning processes within a unit on this unit’s knowledge outflows. Knowl-  edge inflows are associated with a recipient acquiring knowledge from a donor, where  the knowledge recipient is the focal unit of analysis (Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000;  Schulz, 2003). As we try to understand how knowledge that a manager acquires from  other persons and/or units in the organization, impacts upon this manager’s explora-  tion and exploitation activities, the focus of this paper will be on a manager’s knowl-  edge inflows. For these knowledge inflows, both the knowledge donor and/or recipient  may be the initiator.  Notions of knowledge flows vary somewhat in the literature (cf. Schulz, 2001, p. 662).  Whereas some authors focus on certain types of knowledge such as the transfer of skills  and technology (Tsai, 2002), the transfer of business practices (Szulanski, 1996), or the  transfer of tacit knowledge (Kogut and Zander, 1993; Subramaniam and Venkatraman,  2001), we follow Gupta and Govindarajan (2000) and Schulz (2001, 2003) by adopting  a broader notion on knowledge flows. That is, based on Schulz’ (2001) and Gupta and  Govindarajan’s (2000) definitions of knowledge flows, we define the knowledge inflows of  a manager as the ‘aggregate volume’ (Schulz, 2001, p. 662) of tacit and explicit knowl-  edge pertaining to several domains such as technology, products, processes, strategies,  and markets, which a manager receives or gathers per unit of time, from other persons  and units within the organization. We do not intend to capture inflows of operational or  financial data or the taking of orders. A manager may use different channels to receive  or gather knowledge as conceptualized in this study, for instance, by telephone, e-mail,  regular mail, through formal meetings, informal face-to-face contacts, and by using  shared technologies such as the company’s intranet. Based on studies of intra-  organizational knowledge flows (e.g. Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000; Schulz, 2003), we  distinguish top-down, bottom-up, and horizontal knowledge inflows of managers.  Managers’ Exploration and Exploitation Activities 913  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007  The Impact of Knowledge Inflows on a Manager’s Exploration and  Exploitation Activities  Top-down knowledge inflows of a manager proceed down the hierarchy and are associated  with knowledge coming from persons and units at higher hierarchical levels than the  manager. Within large multi-unit firms, top-down flows of knowledge are typically  confined to the vertical chains of organizational units specialized in functional, tech-  nological, geographical, or product-market related areas of expertise (Gupta and  Govindarajan, 1991; Hedlund, 1994). This implies that the scope of top-down inflows  of knowledge is likely to be narrow (Winter and Szulanski, 2001), i.e. closely related  and even restricted to the recipient’s specialized areas of expertise. Consequently, top-  down inflows of knowledge increase the depth of the recipient manager’s existing  knowledge base rather than the breadth; they enable the recipient to increase, refine,  or improve his or her expertise in a limited or specialized area (cf. Katila and Ahuja,  2002).  Moreover, top-down inflows of knowledge tend to be rather unambiguous; i.e. they  possess a clear and proven understanding of cause-effect relationships (Egelhoff, 1991),  and their relevance with respect to improving the recipient’s current activities is normally  well-known (Schulz, 2003). Consequently, top-down knowledge inflows allow the recipi-  ent manager to respond to problems in familiar ways, and to increase the manager’s  ability to effectively and efficiently perform existing activities (Daft and Lengel, 1986;  Galunic and Rodan, 1998); i.e. they allow the recipient manager to increase reliability,  rather than variety, in experience.  The arguments above indicate that top-down knowledge inflows of a manager, being  rather narrow and unambiguous (Egelhoff, 1991; Schulz, 2003; Winter and Szulanski,  2001), positively relate to the manager’s exploitation activities, but are unlikely to relate  to the manager’s exploration activities. However, senior management can influence  middle and front-line managers’ exploration activities by means other than by top-down  knowledge inflows. Senior management, for example, may trigger exploration within a  firm by changing the characteristics of the organizational structure such as increasing  other managers’ participation in decision making or decreasing managers’ formalization  of tasks (e.g. Duncan, 1976; McGrath, 2001; Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996), or by  implementing cross-functional interfaces (Egelhoff, 1991; Galbraith, 1973). Other  studies argue that the CEO can trigger managers’ exploration activities, for instance, by  fostering a culture which allows for deviant behaviour and differing opinions and ideas  (Volberda, 1998), or by challenging the strategic status quo of the firm (Bartlett and  Ghoshal, 1993; O’Reilly and Tushman 2004).  Although the literature indicates that higher level managers may exert an influence on  other managers’ exploration activities by other means than top-down knowledge inflows,  we argue that knowledge which comes from higher hierarchical levels does not relate to  the recipient manager’s exploration activities, but rather will be positively related to this  manager’s exploitation activities, suggesting the following hypothesis:  Hypothesis 1: Top-down knowledge inflows of a manager will be positively related to  the extent to which this manager engages in exploitation activities.  T. J. M. Mom et al.914  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007  Bottom-up knowledge inflows of a manager are associated with knowledge coming from  persons and units at lower hierarchical levels than the manager. Contrary to bottom-up  knowledge inflows of a manager, bottom-up inflows of data are rather unambiguous and  provide the recipient manager with data in standardized and formalized ways about, for  instance, the current performance of the organization; motivating the recipient manager  to engage in exploitation activities (Brady and Davies, 2004; Sanchez and Heene, 1996).  Bottom-up inflows of knowledge, however, do not follow these standardized and formal-  ized paths in an organization, rather they come about in ad hoc, random, unpredictable,  and reciprocal interactions between the knowledge donor and knowledge recipient  (Burgelman, 1983b) and typically demand qualitative rather than quantitative changes of  existing activities (Sanchez and Heene, 1996). Consequently, bottom-up knowledge  inflows of a manager do not relate to this manager’s reliability in experience or to the  depth of this manager’s existing knowledge base; they are unlikely to impact upon the  extent to which this manager engages in exploitation activities.  Regarding exploration, bottom-up knowledge inflows of a manager are likely to  increase variety in experience; previous conceptual and case studies in the field of  strategy research illustrate that front-line managers are directly confronted with new  technological developments, unexpected problems, and changing market conditions and  customer demands (Branzei et al., 2004; Burgelman, 1983b; Sheremata, 2000; Van De  Ven, 1980) and that bottom-up inflows of knowledge provide higher level managers with  an increased understanding of changes regarding existing technologies, products, pro-  cesses, and markets and with increased understanding of new or emerging technologies,  markets, customer needs, or internal initiatives (Brady and Davies, 2004; Branzei et al.,  2004; Burgelman, 1983b; Floyd and Lane, 2000). Consequently, a manager’s bottom-up  knowledge inflows may be a major source of exploratory learning by adding new  knowledge to the recipient’s existing knowledge base (Brady and Davies, 2004);  bottom-up knowledge inflows may trigger knowledge recipient managers to revise  current beliefs, to search for, develop, and experiment with various novel solutions to  emerging problems, and to redefine strategic decisions (Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1993;  Burgelman, 1983b; Floyd and Lane, 2000; Kimberly, 1979; Quinn, 1985).  The arguments above suggest that bottom-up knowledge inflows of a manager do not  relate to this manager’s exploitation activities, but rather positively influence this man-  ager’s exploration activities, suggesting the following hypothesis:  Hypothesis 2: Bottom-up knowledge inflows of a manager will be positively related to  the extent to which this manager engages in exploration activities.  Horizontal knowledge inflows of a manager are associated with knowledge coming from  peer managers in the same organizational unit, or coming from other units at the same  hierarchical level. Acquiring horizontal knowledge is enabled by cross-functional inter-  faces characterized by rich and dense personal reciprocal interactions (Galbraith, 1973;  Subramaniam and Youndt, 2005; Tsai, 2001). Through such reciprocal personal inter-  actions, managers typically acquire knowledge from other parts of the organization  which is rather ambiguous, complex and tacit (Daft and Lengel, 1986; Egelhoff, 1991).  Acquiring this knowledge is less effective for dealing with or improving analysable and  Managers’ Exploration and Exploitation Activities 915  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007  rather unequivocal tasks and associated problems (Daft and Lengel, 1986; Egelhoff,  1991). Hence, horizontal knowledge inflows are unlikely to influence reliability in man-  agers’ experience; they do not relate to a manager’s exploitation activities.  However, the personal and reciprocal interactions by which a manager acquires  horizontal knowledge, contribute to this manager’s ability to interpret ambiguous and  complex issues and to build understanding about new acquired knowledge (Daft and  Lengel, 1986; Jansen et al., 2005), enabling the manager to increase variety in experience  (Katila and Ahuja, 2002; Van Den Bosch and Van Wijk, 1999). Consequently, by  stimulating cross-fertilization or (re-)combinations of different kinds of knowledge, hori-  zontal inflows of knowledge have been found to enhance innovation and the creation of  new knowledge at the recipient level (e.g. Grant, 1996; Kogut and Zander, 1992;  Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967).  Moreover, horizontal knowledge inflows cross functional, disciplinary, and techno-  logical areas (Grant, 1996; Hedlund, 1994; Leonard-Barton, 1995; Thompson, 1967).  Consequently, their scope is likely to be broad (Winter and Szulanski, 2001); they are  distant or unrelated to the recipient’s existing knowledge base, increasing the breadth,  rather than the depth, of the manager’s existing knowledge base.  As the arguments above indicate that horizontal knowledge inflows of a manager  are unlikely to relate to this manager’s reliability in experience or to the depth of this  manager’s knowledge base, we argue that horizontal knowledge inflows are not related  to a manager’s exploitation activities. However, as horizontal knowledge inflows  increase the breadth of the manager’s knowledge base and variety in experience, we  argue that these knowledge inflows positively relate to the manager’s exploration  activities.  Hypothesis 3: Horizontal knowledge inflows of a manager will be positively related to  the extent to which this manager engages in exploration activities.  METHOD  Data Collection  The empirical research was conducted at an international electronics firm, which  ranks among the top 10 in the electronics industry on the Fortune Global 500 (2005)  in terms of revenue. Research in this firm was carried out in one of the three divisions  of the firm’s semiconductor group. Regarding the selection of this firm and its semi-  conductor group, several challenges in the semiconductor industry, such as rapid tech-  nological progress, manufacturing complexity, ongoing trends of globalization and  miniaturization, and fierce competition on first-to-market, low costs, and innovation,  compel firms active in the semiconductor industry to both explore and exploit (Burgel-  man, 2002; Henisz and Macher, 2004; Iansiti, 2000; Rosenkopf and Nerkar, 2001).  Investigating managers’ exploration and exploitation activities, as this study does, calls  for examining managers whose firms are confronted with pressures to explore and  pressures to exploit, as this increases the probability of observing managers’ explora-  tion activities and managers’ exploitation activities. Previous empirical studies that  T. J. M. Mom et al.916  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007  investigate issues related to exploration and exploitation, especially those in the field of  technological innovation, also take firms active in the semiconductor industry as an  empirical setting (e.g. Brown and Eisenhardt, 1997; Danneels, 2002; Rosenkopf and  Nerkar, 2001). Furthermore, we chose the selected division because it serves multiple  markets with different degrees of dynamism and competitiveness, which increases the  probability of observing various levels of managers’ exploration and exploitation activi-  ties (cf. Cheng and Van De Ven, 1996; Garcia et al., 2003; Luo, 2002). The other  group’s two divisions each serve a single market. Finally, regarding the selection logic,  the knowledge literature indicates the value of examining firms whose members possess  high levels of specialized knowledge when investigating intra-organizational knowledge  flows, as the transfer of knowledge between individuals plays an important role in  such firms, and hence increases the probability of observing various levels and  different directionalities of knowledge flows (Grant, 1996; Kogut and Zander, 1992).  Technology firms, like semiconductor firms, are cited examples of firms whose  members possess high levels of specialized knowledge (cf. Iansiti, 2000; Smith et al.,  2005).  The selected division employs over 7000 employees and has R&D and production  facilities in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. It consists of a headquarters, a production  support unit, and five product-market related organizational units. One of these  product-market units concentrates on the innovative part of the automotive industry  (product-market unit 1), one unit relates to niche products (product-market unit 2),  and three units relate to general application, standard, and interface products (respec-  tively product-market units 3, 4, and 5) for various industries. All organizational units  face challenges to both explore and exploit, but we expect managers of the production  support unit, however, to engage more in exploitation activities as compared to the  managers of the product-market related units, as the production support unit’s focus is  primarily centred on operational efficiency. Based on external data, we also expect  managers of the product-market unit which is active in the innovative part of the  automotive industry and managers of the product-market unit which concentrates on  niche-products to focus more on exploration activities as compared to the managers of  the other organizational units, as their business environments are the most dynamic  ones.  In cooperation with the division’s headquarters, questionnaires were made available  electronically to all 225 managers of the five product-market units and the production  support unit. These managers are responsible, for instance, for a functional area, a  geographical area, or a particular product or technology. To ensure confidentiality, we  agreed not to reveal the name of the manager; 136 managers returned the questionnaire,  yielding a response rate of 60 per cent. List-wise deletion of cases with missing values  reduced the final sample to 104. We examined differences between respondents and  non-respondents to test for non-response bias. Chi-square tests indicate that the hypoth-  esis that the distribution of the respondents over the organizational units and functional  areas corresponds to the population’s distribution, cannot be rejected (p < 0.05;  a = 0.05). We also compared early and late respondents in terms of demographic  characteristics and model variables. No significant differences (t-test; p < 0.05) appeared,  indicating that non-response bias is not a problem.  Managers’ Exploration and Exploitation Activities 917  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007  Measures  Exploration and exploitation. As appropriate scales at the individual level of analysis were  not yet available in the literature we constructed scales for exploration and exploitation.  We developed seven exploration activity items and seven exploitation activity items  based on the features by which March (1991, p. 71) characterizes the constructs of  exploration and exploitation. The exploration scale determines the extent to which a  manager engaged in exploration activities last year while the exploitation scale deter-  mines the extent to which the manager engaged in exploitation activities last year. To  enhance the construct validity of the scales and their items, we conducted in-depth  interviews with 12 managers with various functions at different organizational units.  Based on these interviews, five items were reworded. Factor analyses with all 14 items,  based on the survey data, revealed that two summated scales could be constructed: one  exploration scale with five exploration items and one exploitation scale with six exploi-  tation items. These items are reported in Table I. Managers responded to the question  ‘To what extent did you, last year, engage in work related activities that can be charac-  terized as follows . . .’, after which they judged the exploration and exploitation items.  The reliability of the summated scales as represented by Cronbach’s alpha is 0.86 for the  exploration scale and 0.81 for the exploitation scale.  Knowledge inflows. Top-down knowledge inflows are associated with knowledge coming  from persons and units at higher hierarchical levels than the recipient manager.  Bottom-up knowledge inflows are associated with knowledge coming from persons and  units at lower hierarchical levels than the recipient manager. Horizontal knowledge  inflows are associated with knowledge coming from persons and units at the same  hierarchical level. Following Gupta and Govindarajan (2000) and Schulz (2001) and our  associated conceptualization of knowledge, we informed respondents that we are not  interested in operational or financial data or the taking of orders, but rather in tacit and  explicit knowledge pertaining to: technologies, processes, systems, products, strategies,  and markets. Managers were furthermore instructed to think about different channels  through which knowledge might flow such as telephone, e-mail, regular mail, formal  meetings, informal face-to-face contacts, and shared technologies such as the company’s  intranet. Subsequently, following Gupta and Govindarajan (2000, p. 483) and Schulz  (2001, p. 680), the question to which managers responded was phrased as follows: ‘To  what extent did you, last year, receive or gather knowledge from . . .’, after which they  judged eight knowledge inflow items. These items are reported in Table I. The reliability  as represented by Cronbach’s alphas of the scales are 0.79 for the top-down knowledge  inflows scale (three items), 0.80 for the bottom-up knowledge inflow scale (two items), and  0.74 for the horizontal knowledge inflow scale (three items).  Control variables. The empirical research within the selected division took place in the five  product-market units and the production support unit. Using five dummy variables, for  each product-market unit one, we intended to control for organizational unit and  environmental effects.

Several authors argue that environmen-  tal effects, like environmental dynamism, impact upon exploration and exploitation  (Levinthal and March, 1993; Lewin et al., 1999). Sidhu et al. (2004), for instance, showed  that the greater environmental dynamism, the greater an organization’s exploration  orientation. Although managers of all units face challenges to both explore and exploit,  as indicated above, we expect managers of the production support unit to focus more on  exploitation activities as compared to managers of the other product-market units. We  also expect managers of the automotive and niche-products product-market units to  focus more on exploration activities as compared to the managers of the other units.  Functional areas within the division relate in particular to research & development  and marketing & sales. Other functional areas are finance, human resources and logis-  tics. Using two dummy variables, one for research & development and another for  marketing & sales, we intended to control for functional effects. We expect managers in  research & development to engage more in exploration activities as compared to man-  agers in marketing & sales and the other functional areas. Exploration related activities  like searching, experimenting, and discovering constitute an important part of R&D.  Measure and model structure tests. We conducted exploratory and confirmatory factor  analyses including all items pertaining to the independent and dependent variables; the  exploration items, exploitation items, top-down, bottom-up, and horizontal knowledge  inflow items. Results of the exploratory factor analysis (see Table I) indicate that the five  variables were appropriately constructed; eigenvalues for each factor were greater than 1,  all items loaded on their appropriate factors at greater than 0.62, andno itemcross-loading  was greater than 0.33. We used EQS to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis to test for  discriminant validity of the constructs.We allowed each item to load only on the factor for  which it was a proposed indicator. Results indicate that the five factor model fits the data  well (NFI = 0.93, CFI = 0.94, RMSEA < 0.06). Moreover, a comparison of a one-factor  model with a two-factor model for every pair among the five factors shows a significant  improvement in fit for each of the ten pairs ( Δχ1df2 between 43.56 and 221.69; p < 0.001),  providing evidence of discriminant validity (Bagozzi and Phillips, 1982).  ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  Table II presents descriptive statistics and correlations for the variables as used in the  study. T-tests show that the means of managers’ exploitation (5.27) and exploration  (5.28) activities do not significantly differ from each other. However, the means of  managers’ knowledge inflows do differ from each other; the mean of top-down knowl-  edge inflows (3.78) is significantly (p < 0.001) lower than the means of bottom-up (5.56)  and horizontal (4.60) knowledge inflows. This may indicate that, as intended, the top-  down knowledge inflow scale did not measure the taking of commands or orders, as in  that case, the extent of top-down ‘knowledge’ inflows would probably have been larger.  Furthermore, the mean horizontal knowledge inflows is significantly (p < 0.001) lower  than the mean of bottom-up knowledge inflows. Furthermore, Table II shows that  several of the independent and control variables significantly relate to each other. To  examine the issue of multicollinearity, we calculated variance inflation factors (VIF) in  Managers’ Exploration and Exploitation Activities 921  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007  T  ab  le  II  .

VIF factors are between 2.2 and 1.3, which is well  below the below the rule-of-thumb cut-off of 10 (Hair et al., 1998).  Table III presents the results of the hierarchical regression analyses for exploitation  (models 1a and 1b) and exploration (models 2a and 2b). Models 1a and 2a are the  baseline models containing the control variables. Models 1b and 2b represent the full  models considering the effect of the knowledge inflows. To discuss the results we will  focus on the full models. Regarding the control variables, model 1b shows that managers  of product-market unit 1 (b = -0.28, p < 0.05), i.e. the unit which concentrates on the  innovative part of the automotive industry, and managers of product-market unit 2  (b = -0.29, p < 0.05), i.e. the unit which concentrates on niche products, tend to engage  significantly less in exploitation activities than managers in the production support unit.  This is not surprising as the production support unit’s focus is strongly on operational  efficiency, whereas the business environments of the two product-market units concerned  are the most dynamic ones. Model 2b shows that managers in the functional areas R&D  (b = 0.27, p < 0.01) and marketing & sales (b = 0.26, p < 0.01) engage more in explora-  tion activities than managers in other functional areas. The findings regarding R&D are  in line with our expectations. Regarding marketing & sales, the company launched a new  company-wide publicity campaign about a year preceding the survey which may have  forced these managers to engage more in exploration activities than we initially expected.  Regarding managers’ knowledge inflows and their exploitation activities, model 1b  shows that top-down knowledge inflows of a manager positively relate to the extent to  which this manager engages in exploitation activities (b = 0.24, p < 0.05), supporting  Hypothesis 1. Moreover, as expected, both bottom-up and horizontal knowledge inflows  do not significantly relate to a manager’s exploitation activities. Regarding managers’  knowledge inflows and their exploration activities, model 2b shows, consistently with  Hypotheses 2 and 3, that both bottom-up knowledge inflows (b = 0.32, p < 0.01) and  horizontal knowledge inflows (b = 0.26, p < 0.05) of a manager positively relate to the  extent to which this manager engages in exploration activities. Moreover, as expected,  top-down knowledge inflows of a manager do not significantly relate to this manager’s  exploration activities.  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  Firms face difficulties in managing exploration and exploitation concurrently, as the two  tend to drive out each other (Levinthal and March, 1993; March, 1991). Previous  research illustrates how organizational factors impact upon firm or unit level exploration  and exploitation processes or outcomes (e.g. Adler et al., 1999; Benner and Tushman,  2002, 2003; Ghemawat and Ricart I Costa, 1993; Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004; Jansen  et al., 2006; Leana and Barry, 2000; Levinthal and March, 1993; Rivkin and Siggelkow,  2003; Sheremata, 2000). There is, however, a lack of conceptually and empirically  validated understanding about exploration and exploitation activities at the manager  level of analysis and how these activities are influenced by a manager’s intra-  organizational knowledge inflows. This paper aims to contribute to this understanding.  Regarding the relationship between exploration and exploitation, March (1991, p. 72)  argues that a trade-off exists between exploration and exploitation at several levels.

Mom et al.924  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007  Recently, studies show that exploration and exploitation are not mutually exclusive at the  firm-level (He and Wong, 2004) or business unit-level (Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004).  With respect to exploration and exploitation at the level of the manager level, this paper’s  findings support the proposition that exploration and exploitation are not mutually  exclusive at the manager level as well. Whereas some managers engage more in explo-  ration activities as compared to exploitation activities, or the other way around, other  managers have high levels of both exploration and exploitation. This may be illustrated  by the non-significant correlation between exploration and exploitation (Table II), and  by the results of the exploratory (Table I) and confirmatory factor analyses, which  empirically indicate that, although exploration and exploitation are two separate dimen-  sions, managers may combine both exploration and exploitation activities.  Regarding the influence of a manager’s knowledge inflows on this manager’s explo-  ration and exploitation activities, this paper illustrates, as expected, that top-down  knowledge inflows of a manager positively relate to the extent to which this manager  conducts exploitation activities, while they do not relate to a manager’s exploration  activities. Furthermore, as expected, bottom-up and horizontal knowledge inflows of a  manager positively relate to the extent to which this manager conducts exploration  activities, while they do not relate to a manager’s exploitation activities. Accordingly, this  study indicates that increasing managers’ top-down knowledge inflows within an orga-  nization, without enabling bottom-up or horizontal inflows, is likely to increase manag-  ers’ exploitation activities without increasing their exploration activities. This would lead  to exploitation driving out exploration. Furthermore, stimulating managers’ bottom-up  and/or horizontal knowledge inflows within an organization, without stimulating top-  down knowledge flows, is likely to increase exploration activities of managers without  increasing their exploitation activities. This would lead to exploration driving out exploi-  tation. Moreover, a logical deduction of the hypotheses and empirical findings would  indicate that the more a manager acquires both top-down and bottom-up knowledge  flows, or both top-down and horizontal knowledge flows, the higher the levels of both  exploration and exploitation activities this manager may engage in.  Furthermore, the findings of this paper illustrate how managers’ knowledge inflows  enable or inhibit them in terms of responding to particular ways in which a firm may  combine exploration and exploitation. We distinguish on the basis of Volberda (1998)  three main organizational responses for combining exploration and exploitation: spatial  separation, temporal separation and synthesis. Each of these responses places different  demands on managers’ exploration activities and exploitation activities. In spatial separa-  tion, both exploration and exploitation take place, but in different places in the organi-  zation. For instance, according to proponents of structural ambidexterity (e.g. Benner  and Tushman, 2003; Duncan, 1976; Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996), top- or corporate-  level managers should engage in both exploration and exploitation activities, whereas  business unit managers should focus on either exploration or exploitation activities,  depending on the focus of their business unit which is either explorative or exploitative.  Our findings illustrate that in a firm characterized by spatial separation, top-down  knowledge inflows would be of particular value for managers in places focusing on  exploitation, whereas bottom-up and/or horizontal knowledge inflows would be of  particular value for managers in places focusing on exploration.  Managers’ Exploration and Exploitation Activities 925  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007  Studies of technological innovation and strategic renewal indicate that firms may deal  with tensions between exploration and exploitation by temporally separating the two (Audia  et al., 2000; Shepard, 1967; Tushman and Anderson, 1986). This implies for managers  that they shift their focus over time from pursuing incremental innovations or stability to  pursuing radical innovations or strategic renewal, or vice versa. Our findings illustrate  that in a firm characterized by temporal separation, top-down knowledge inflows would  be of particular value for managers in time periods focusing on exploitation, whereas  bottom-up and/or horizontal knowledge inflows would be of particular value for man-  agers in time periods focusing on exploration.  The third identified organizational response for pursuing both exploration and exploi-  tation is by synthesizing them; that is, by creating organizational units in which the tensions  between exploration and exploitation are reconciled (Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004).  Such units combine various contradictory elements like centripetal and centrifugal forces  (Sheremata, 2000), routine and non-routine tasks (Adler et al., 1999), and hard and soft  processes or systems (Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004). These elements should encourage  managers to conduct both exploration and exploitation related activities, or as Gibson  and Birkinshaw (2004, p. 210) point out, these elements should enable them ‘to make  their own judgments about how to divide their time between conflicting demands for  alignment and adaptability’. Our findings illustrate that in firms or units aiming at  synthesizing exploration and exploitation, a combination of both top-down and bottom-  up, or a combination of both top-down and horizontal knowledge inflows would be of  particular value for managers.  The paper may also deliver a contribution to strategy process research (e.g. Bartlett  and Ghoshal, 1993; Floyd and Lane, 2000; Rivkin and Siggelkow, 2003; Van Cauwen-  bergh and Cool, 1982). Whereas the exchange of knowledge between managers plays an  important role in studies of strategy process research, quantitative research is lacking. In  such studies, bottom-up knowledge flows are generally associated with exploratory pro-  cesses such as competence definition processes (Floyd and Lane, 2000), or with autono-  mous strategic initiatives (Burgelman, 1983a, 1983b). Using quantitative data, this study  illustrated that bottom-up knowledge inflows of managers relate to their exploration  activities. Top-down knowledge flows are generally associated with exploitative processes  such as competence deployment processes (Floyd and Lane, 2000), or induced strategic  behaviour (Burgelman, 1983a, 1983b). This study illustrated that top-down knowledge  inflows of managers relate to their exploitation activities. Moreover, whereas studies of  strategy process research tend to focus on knowledge flows across hierarchical levels, this  paper illustrated the importance of managers’ horizontal knowledge inflows as well,  especially in terms of stimulating managers’ exploration activities.  Our findings have limitations suggesting several issues for future research. The study  involves cross-sectional, single informant data and uses perceptual scales highlighting  issues of causal reciprocity and common method bias. Regarding the issue of causal  reciprocity, confusion may exist regarding whether knowledge flows affect managers’  exploration and exploitation activities, or whether the choice of activities affects the type  of knowledge flows which come about. We recognized this potential confusion and  addressed this issue in the paper by focusing on knowledge inflows only, and by indicating  that both the knowledge donor and the knowledge recipient may be the initiator of such  T. J. M. Mom et al.926  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007  knowledge inflows. Further insight into the direction of causality between knowledge  flows and exploration and exploitation activities could be created by examining knowl-  edge outflows. Future research could examine how a manager’s exploration and/or  exploitation activities impact upon the level and directionalities of knowledge outflows of  this manager. At the organization unit level, Schulz (2001) shows that a unit’s exploration  and/or exploitation activities impact upon the extent and kind of knowledge outflows of  this unit (cf. Schulz, 2001). Summarizing, we would argue that a manager’s knowledge  inflows impact upon this manager’s exploration and exploitation activities, whereas these  activities may influence the manager’s knowledge outflows. Consequently, reciprocal  causal relationships may exist between knowledge flows within a firm or unit and this  manager’s exploration and exploitation activities.  Regarding the issue of common method bias we performed Harman’s one-factor test  on items included in the regression models. If common method bias were a serious  problem in the study, we would expect a single factor to emerge to account for most of  the covariance in the dependent and independent variables (Podsakoff and Organ,  1986). We did not find such a single factor. The issue of common method bias could be  addressed in future studies by measuring exploration and exploitation at the managerial  level of analysis using objective measures.  Although a contribution of this paper is the development of scales which assess a  manager’s level of exploration and exploitation, and the validity and reliability analyses  indicated that the scales were appropriately constructed, linking objective exploration  and exploitation measures to the scales as used in this study could increase insight into  the scales’ validity. Furthermore, conducting this research in other industries could also  help to better assess the validity and reliability of the scales and help to increase the  generalizability of the findings.  The relevance of the findings could be further increased by examining the impact of  managers’ exploration and exploitation activities on unit- or organization-level perfor-  mance, on incremental and radical innovations or on strategic renewal. Another inter-  esting extension of our work could be to examine the relation between managers’  exploration and exploitation activities, their knowledge inflows, and organizational ele-  ments, such as, for instance, organizational structural characteristics, controls, rewards,  the social context, and coordination mechanisms (Duncan, 1976; Ghemawat and Ricart  I Costa, 1993; Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004; Jansen et al., 2005).  Despite these limitations, this paper furthers understanding of managers’ exploration  and exploitation activities and into how these activities may be influenced. This benefits  our insight into how to build both exploration and exploitation within a firm, which will  contribute to the firm’s competitive advantage.

Investigating the Development of the  Internal and External Service Tasks of  Non-executive Directors: the case of  the Netherlands (1997–2005)  Pieter-Jan Bezemer*, Gregory F. Maassen,  Frans A. J. Van den Bosch and Henk W. Volberda  During the last decade, globalisation and liberalisation of financial markets, changing societal  expectations and corporate governance scandals have increased the attention for the fiduciary  duties of non-executive directors. In this context, recent corporate governance reform initia-  tives have emphasised the control task and independence of non-executive directors.  However, little attention has been paid to their impact on the external and internal service  tasks of non-executive directors. Therefore, this paper investigates how the service tasks of  non-executive directors have evolved in the Netherlands. Data on corporate governance at the  top-100 listed companies in the Netherlands between 1997 and 2005 show that the emphasis on  non-executive directors’ external service task has shifted to their internal service task, i.e. from  non-executive directors acting as boundary spanners to non-executive directors providing  advice and counselling to executive directors. This shift in board responsibilities affects  non-executive directors’ ability to generate network benefits through board relationships and  has implications for non-executive directors’ functional requirements.  Keywords: Corporate governance codes, non-executive directors, The Netherlands  Introduction  O ver the last ten years, the globalisationand liberalisation of financial markets  and stronger societal demands for accountabil-  ity and transparency of companies have placed  the fiduciary duties of non-executive directors  in the centre of the corporate governance  debate. Recent corporate governance scandals  such as Enron and WorldCom in the United  States, Parmalat in Italy andAhold in the Neth-  erlands have heated the international corpo-  rate governance debate (Ingley and Van der  Walt, 2005; Jonsson, 2005; Kiel and Nicholson,  2003) and they have triggered worldwide  corporate governance reforms (Aguilera and  Cuervo-Cazurra, 2004; Enrione et al., 2006;  Sheridan et al., 2006). This has resulted in the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States, cor-  porate governance directives in the European  Union and additional national corporate  legislation across the European Continent.  In addition, most European countries have  introduced new corporate governance codes  such as the Cromme Code in Germany (2002),  the Bouton Report in France (2002) and the  Combined Code in the United Kingdom  (2003).  Although the effectiveness of corporate gov-  ernance codes in disciplining corporations and  preventing corporate governance scandals has  been questioned (Cools, 2006; Enrione et al.,  2006), these codes are important reflections of  corporate governance developments, societal  norms and values, and expectations of key  stakeholders. They highlight to society which  improvements are central for regaining the  trust in corporate governance systems and  *Address for correspondence:  Department of Strategic Man-  agement & Business En-  vironment, RSM Erasmus  University, P.O.

Given  this background, it is not strange that corpo-  rate governance codes, in line with principles  from the agency theory, have attempted to  strengthen the control task and the indepen-  dence of non-executive directors (Daily et al.,  2003; Enrione et al., 2006). However, the impact  of these reform initiatives on the service tasks  of non-executive directors has been largely  neglected. In fact, the emphasis on board  control and board independence may hamper  non-executive directors’ external service task  in providing access to resources on which cor-  porations are dependent (Boyd, 1990; Pfeffer,  1972, 1973) and they may limit their task in  corporate learning through board relation-  ships (Mizruchi, 1996; Westphal et al., 2001).  Furthermore, the emphasis on board control  and independence may undermine non-  executive directors’ internal service task in  providing advice and counselling to executive  directors (Carpenter and Westphal, 2001;  McNulty and Pettigrew, 1999). After all, inter-  dependence, maintenance of closeness and a  focus on joint value creation are necessary for  fostering the external and internal service tasks  (Forbes and Milliken, 1999; Hamel et al., 1998).  This raises the question as to how the exter-  nal and internal service tasks of non-executive  directors have been affected by corporate gov-  ernance codes, triggered by broad corporate  governance developments. By addressing this  question in the Dutch financial market, the  paper makes two main contributions. First, it  describes how two Dutch corporate gover-  nance codes with an emphasis on the control  task and the independence of non-executive  directors relate to the external and internal  service tasks of non-executive directors. We  find empirical evidence that corporate gover-  nance measures taken to reinforce board  control may hamper non-executive directors’  external service task, while reinvigorating  their internal service task. Second, by describ-  ing how non-executive directors fulfil their  service tasks in a two-tier board context, we  provide a more thorough understanding of  the functioning of the two-tier board model  regarding these tasks.  The paper is structured as follows: Section  one provides a short description of the Dutch  corporate governance context, i.e. the two-tier  board system, recent developments and cor-  porate governance reform initiatives. Section  two elaborates on the external and internal  service tasks of non-executive directors and  discusses how provisions in two Dutch cor-  porate governance codes – aimed at strength-  ening the control task of non-executive  director – are related to their service tasks.  Section three portrays the evolution of the  service tasks of non-executive directors on  supervisory boards of the top-100 listed  corporations at the Euronext in Amsterdam  between 1997 and 2005. Section four con-  cludes with a discussion of our main findings  and their implications for corporate gover-  nance scholars and practitioners.  Corporate governance in  The Netherlands  Most Dutch listed corporations have a two-tier  board consisting of a management board and  a supervisory board. The supervisory board  solely consists of non-executive directors to  assure its independence. It is responsible for  the supervision of the management board and  it assists executive directors with advice and  counselling (Maassen and Van den Bosch,  1999; Hooghiemstra and Van Manen, 2004). In  line with this board model, the supervisory  board has the fiduciary responsibility to act in  the best interests of the company and all the  company’s stakeholders.  Over the last ten years, Dutch financial  markets have seen dramatic changes. The  liabilities of non-executive directors have  increased, the influence of shareholders has  grown significantly, the financial press and  general public have become more vocal and  critical, and private equity and hedge funds  have become more active (Hamel et al., 1998;  Maassen, 1999). Moreover, Dutch supervisory  boards have internationalised and the financial  board’ networks have changed (Heemskerk  et al., 2003; Heemskerk, 2007; Spencer Stuart,  2006). These developments have resulted in  an increasing convergence of the Anglo-  American shareholder model and the Rhine-  land stakeholder model in the Netherlands,  i.e. increasing communalities between the one-  tier board model and the two-tier board model  (Collier and Mahbub, 2005; Maassen and Van  den Bosch, 1999). In this context two Dutch  corporate governance codes have been intro-  duced since 1997. Both codes address the  above mentioned corporate governance devel-  opments, societal norms and values and the  expectations of key stakeholders. Thereby,  they highlight several important topics of the  corporate governance debate in the Nether-  lands and their development and introduction  might have affected and adjusted what non-  executive directors in reality are doing (Mace,  1971, 1972; Ocasio, 1999; Huse, 2007).  The first corporate governance committee,  the Peters Committee, was an initiative of rep-  resentatives from the Association of Securities  Issuing Companies and the Amsterdam Stock  1120 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  Volume 15 Number 6 November 2007 © 2007 The Authors  Journal compilation © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2007  Exchange. The committee published its forty  recommendations in 1997 and initiated a  public corporate governance debate to intro-  duce best practice provisions and to improve  board practices on the basis of self-regulation  (Maassen, 1999).  In 2003, a second corporate governance  committee published the Tabaksblat Code. In  contrast to its predecessor, this code was an  initiative of the Ministry of Finance and Eco-  nomic Affairs, its scope was wider and aimed  at legislative changes if needed. Although the  Tabaksblat Code is based on self-regulation, a  recent amendment to Dutch corporate law  legally binds listed companies to explain  deviations from the Tabaksblat code’s recom-  mendations in their annual reports. The  amendment also requires companies to obtain  the approval of the general meeting of share-  holders for any deviation from the code based  on a “comply or explain” regime. Table 1 pro-  vides an overview of the main commonalities  and differences between the Peters Code and  the Tabaksblat Code.  The external and internal service  tasks of non-executives  Traditionally, the primary responsibility of the  supervisory board has been to control the  management board to assure that executive  directors are acting in the best interests of  shareholders. This control responsibility is  rooted in agency theory and deemed neces-  sary for counteracting the potential for mana-  gerial opportunism, which can arise as a result  of the separation between corporate owner-  ship and management (Davis et al., 1997; Zahra  and Pearce, 1989). Supervisory boards are an  important internal control mechanisms for  shareholders (Daily et al., 2003; Hendry and  Kiel, 2004) as they have the authority to nomi-  nate, reward and remove executive directors  from office and to ratify audit reports, capital  investments and other key corporate decisions  (Baysinger and Hoskisson, 1990; Johnson et al.,  1996). Based on principles from the agency  theory, corporate governance reform initia-  tives have generally emphasised board inde-  pendence to avoid conflicts of interest of  directors and third parties. By maintaining  a distance from executive directors and by  having a focus on the prevention of failures,  non-executive directors are ascribed the posi-  tion to adequately supervise management  boards.  As an additional task, scholars have recogn-  ised the service tasks of non-executive direc-  tors and supervisory boards. Social Network  Theory, Resource Dependence Theory and  the Resource Based View emphasise that  non-executive directors are able to contribute  positively to corporate decision-making as  Table 1: The Peters Code versus the Tabaksblat Code  Code Attributes Peters Code Tabaksblat Code  • Publication Date • October 28, 1997 • December 9, 2003  • Initiator(s) • Association of Securities Issuing  Companies (VEUO), Amsterdam Stock  Exchange (AEX)  • Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs  • Composition of the  Governance  Committee  • Representatives from the VEUO and AEX,  non-executive directors, and professional  experts  • Representatives from the VEUO and AEX,  non-executive directors, and professional  experts  • Main Purpose • Initiating a national corporate governance  debate  • Improving the corporate governance  system by providing principle-based best  practices  • Short Description • 40 best practices about the relations  between management boards, supervisory  boards and investors  • Detailed principles and best practice  provisions about the relations between  management boards, supervisory boards  and investors  • Audience • All companies with registered offices in  the Netherlands and whose shares are  listed on a recognised stock exchange  • All companies with registered offices in  the Netherlands and whose shares are  listed on a recognised stock exchange  • Legal Grounding • No; Self-regulation • Yes; Comply or explain principle  Sources: Peter’s Code (1997), Tabaksblat Code (2003) and Maassen (1999).

Huse (2005, 2007) distinguishes  between the external and internal service tasks  of non-executive directors. The external  service task focuses on value that is created  through the relationships non-executive direc-  tors have with external actors and is rooted  in Social Network Theory and Resource De-  pendence Theory. The internal service task  emphasises corporate value that is created  by non-executives by providing advice and  counselling to executive directors and origi-  nates from the Resource Based View. In con-  trast to the control task with its emphasis on  board independence, the maintenance of inter-  dependence, closeness and a focus on joint  value creation is necessary to be able to utilise  the external relations and internal knowledge  and capabilities that non-executives bring  along (Forbes and Milliken, 1999; Hamel et al.,  1998). Table 2 provides an overview of the  external and internal service tasks and juxta-  poses them against the control task. The fol-  lowing sections discuss both service tasks in  more detail.  The external service task of  non-executive directors  Social Network Theory and Resource Depen-  dence Theory emphasise corporate value that  accrues from the external network position of  non-executive directors (Huse, 2005; Mizruchi,  1996). Social Network Theory asserts that  interlocking directorates constitute an impor-  tant learning vehicle through which corpora-  tions can tap into the knowledge base of  interlock partners (Mizruchi, 1996). Past evi-  dence suggests that these board ties can  influence a whole array of corporate decision-  making outcomes, such as mergers and acqui-  sitions (Haunschild, 1993), the initiation of  strategic renewal (Westphal et al., 2001) and the  adoption of board protection devices (Davis,  1991). Furthermore, Resource Dependence  Theory asserts that board ties are used to incor-  porate resources from the environment, like  legal expertise, political lobbying power and  financial resources on which companies are  dependent. Past evidence suggests that organi-  sations indeed use board relationships to  secure access to financial resources (Pfeffer,  1972) and adjust their board structure and  composition to cope with environmental  uncertainties (Boyd, 1990; Hillman et al., 2000).  While interlocking directorates may provide  corporations with network benefits and im-  prove corporate performance, Dutch corporate  policy makers have been worried about these  relationships for several reasons. First, board  relationships might jeopardise the indepen-  dence of non-executive directors. Stakehold-  ers, while influencing companies through  interlocking directorates, may become too  involved in the boards’ decision-making pro-  cesses and may have serious conflicts of inter-  ests. Second, a highly centralised and dense  network of non-executive directors might  create a social insular system in which board  members are loyal to each other and merely act  as rubber stamps. Third, as the number of  board positions of non-executive directors  increases, it may become more difficult for  non-executive directors to devote enough time  Table 2: The building blocks of the control task and external and internal services tasks  Building Blocks Control Task External Service Task Internal Service Task  • Description Task • Monitoring and  supervision of executive  directors  • Acquiring access to  resources on which the  corporation is dependent  and networking  • Provision of advice and  counselling to executive  directors  • Theoretical Perspective(s) • Agency Theory • Resource Dependence  Theory and Social  Network Theory  • Resource Based View of  the Firm  • Value creation through . . . • . . . monitoring skills and  capabilities of  non-executives  • . . . external relations of  non-executives  • . . . knowledge and  cognitive capabilities of  non-executives  • Characteristics • Independence, distance,  focus on prevention of  failures  • Interdependence,  closeness, focus on joint  value creation  • Interdependence,  closeness, focus on joint  value creation  Sources: Zahra and Pearce (1989), Johnson et al.

To negate these board  network effects, the Peters Code (1997) and  the Tabaksblat Code (2003) have introduced  (1) a limitation on the total number of board  positions a non-executive director may have  on supervisory boards of listed companies (a  maximum of five within listed corporations;  chair positions count as two board positions)  and (2) a limitation on the election of non-  executive directors who had significant busi-  ness relationships with the company one year  prior to their appointment. Table 3 provides  an overview of the recommendations in the  Peters Code (1997) and the Tabaksblat Code  (2003).  The internal service task of  non-executive directors  The Resource Based View of the firm empha-  sises value that accrues from the internal posi-  tion of non-executive directors (Huse, 2005).  With their (management) experience, industry  knowledge and decision-making capabilities,  non-executive directors may provide valuable  advice and counselling during corporate  decision-making processes (Johnson et al.,  1996; Pettigrew and McNulty, 1995; Rindova,  1999; Stiles, 2001). Recent evidence from  Anglo-American oriented countries suggests  that non-executive directors perceive their  contributions in this area to be important to  the performance of corporations (Heracleous,  2001; Ingley and Van der Walt, 2005; Stiles,  2001). Other studies indicate that non-  executive directors are increasingly involved  in decision-management (Hendry and Kiel,  2004; McNulty and Pettigrew, 1999). Joint  board meetings of executive and non-  executive directors on the board and board  committees composed of executives and non-  executives facilitate the internal service task  of non-executive, because these two struc-  tural communication mechanisms enable the  regular exchange of knowledge and ideas  between executive and non-executive  directors.  Although joint board meetings and board  committees composed of executive and non-  executive directors might compromise the  independence of non-executive directors and  hamper the adequate execution of the control  task, Dutch policy makers have been relatively  silent about this. The Peters Code (1997) and  the Tabaksblat Code (2003) only suggest that  the supervisory board evaluate its own func-  tioning and relation with the management  board once a year without executive directors  being present. Generally, supervisory boards  in the Netherlands comply with this principle  (83.5 per cent; Spencer Stuart, 2006). Further-  more, seen from an agency perspective, both  Dutch corporate governance reforms have  advocated the use of independent monitoring  committees (selection and appointment, remu-  neration and audit committees) to support the  Table 3: Control enhancing code recommendations that also relate to the external service task  Board Mechanisms Specific Recommendations in Peters Code and Tabaksblat Code  • Network Ties • “The number of supervisory seats at listed companies held by a single individual  should be limited in such a way as to guarantee the satisfactory fulfillment of the  allotted tasks” (Recommendation 9, Peters Code, 1997).  • “A management board member may not be a member of the supervisory board of  more than two listed companies. Nor may a management board member be the  chairman of the supervisory board of a listed company” (II.1.7, Tabaksblat Code, 2003).  • “The number of supervisory boards of Dutch listed companies of which an individual  may be a member shall be limited to such an extent that the proper performance of  this duties is assured; the maximum number is five, for which purpose the  chairmanship of a supervisory board counts double” (III.3.4, Tabaksblat Code, 2003).  • Network Ties  Representing Financial  Resource Dependencies  • “A supervisory board member shall be deemed independent if [. . .] he has [not] had  an important business relationship with the company, or a company associated with  it, in the year prior to the appointment. This includes the case were the supervisory  board member, or the firm of which he is shareholder, partner, associate or advisor,  has acted as advisor to the company (consultant, external auditor, civil notary and  lawyer) and the case where the supervisory board member is a management board  member or an employee of any bank with which the company has a lasting and  significant relationship” (III.2.2.c, Tabaksblat Code, 2003).  INVESTIGATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SERVICE TASKS 1123  Volume 15 Number 6 November 2007© 2007 The Authors  Journal compilation © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2007  internal control task of supervisory boards (see  Table 4 for the code recommendations).  At the same time, the code provisions may  have supported the internal service task with  their emphasis on the installation and role of  board committees. First, executive directors  often attend meetings of supervisory board  committees, which in the Dutch two-tier board  system by default consist of non-executive  directors (Maassen, 1999; Maassen and Van  den Bosch, 1999). Thereby, board committees  become consultative forums also. Second, the  scope of topics discussed in (monitoring)  board committees tends to go beyond control  issues and touches upon service issues as well  (Spira and Bender, 2004). Third, the use of  additional board committees associated with  the internal service task, such as strategy and  integrity committees, might have been pro-  moted as well (Maassen and Van den Bosch,  1999; Spencer Stuart, 2006). In a similar vein,  the stronger emphasis on board control might  have stimulated the number of supervisory  board meetings. As it is common practice  in the Netherlands that executive directors  join the meetings of non-executive directors,  the intensity of advising and counselling  may have increased also. In conclusion, the  strengthening of the control task of non-  executive directors as a result of corporate  governance developments and the introduc-  tion of the codes may therefore have fostered  the internal service task simultaneously.  Methods and sample  The empirical research focuses on the supervi-  sory boards of the top-100 listed companies at  the Euronext in Amsterdam, including all  AEX, AMX and AScX companies. Together,  these companies represent seven industries  (construction, manufacturing, transport and  communication, wholesale, retail, financial ser-  vices, and other services) and constitute the  backbone of the Dutch economy. The top-100  listed corporations for each year were selected  on the basis of the average market capitalisa-  tion. Supervisory board data for the companies  were collected for the period 1997–2005.  During this period, 54 per cent of the composi-  tion of the top-100 remained the same. During  the first year of this period, the Peters Commit-  tee published their forty recommendations and  started a formal national corporate governance  debate in the Netherlands which resulted in  the Tabaksblat Code in 2003. The data were  obtained from the Spencer Stuart Netherlands  Board Indexes that contain information on non-  executive directors who occupied more than  5,000 board positions on supervisory boards in  the Netherlands during this time period. The  data were checked and complemented by data  obtained from the Worldscope and Reach data-  bases, andannual reports.Overall, this resulted  in 900 firm-year observations.  To utilise the external relationships and  internal knowledge and capabilities that non-  executive directors bring along and to manage  resource dependencies (Forbes and Milliken,  1999; Hamel et al., 1998), interdependence,  maintenance of closeness and focus on joint  value creation are necessary (see Table 2).  Therefore, an important indicator for the func-  tioning of the service tasks is the presence of  organisational mechanisms that facilitate the  actual exchange of knowledge, information  and resources, i.e. structural communication  mechanisms at the board level (Zahra and  George, 2002). In this study we assess how  several board communication mechanisms  related to the functioning of the external and  internal service tasks have evolved in the light  of corporate governance developments and  reform initiatives in the Netherlands.  To portray developments in the external  service task of non-executive directors, the fol-  lowing indicators were used: (1) the average  number of ties a focal top-100 listed company  has with other top-100 listed companies  through formal ties at the supervisory board  level, (2) the average number of ties a top-100  listed company has with financial service pro-  Table 4: Control enhancing code recommendations that also relate to the internal service task  Board Mechanisms Specific Recommendations in Peters Code and Tabaksblat Code  • “The supervisory board should consider the appointment of a selections and appointments  committee from among its members, as well as an audit committee and a remunerations  committee” (Recommendation 15, Peters Code, 1997)  • Board Committees • “If the supervisory board consists of more than four members, it shall appoint from among  its members an audit committee, a remuneration committee and a selection and appointment  committee. The function of the committees is to prepare the decision-making of the  supervisory board” (III.5, Tabaksblat Code, 2003)  1124 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  Volume 15 Number 6 November 2007 © 2007 The Authors  Journal compilation © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2007  viders listed in the top-100 (banks, insurance  companies and investment funds) through  formal ties at the supervisory board level, and  (3) the average number of ties a focal top-100  listed company has with the top-3 listed banks  (ABN Amro, ING, Fortis) through formal ties  at the supervisory board level. Multiple inter-  locks with the same company were counted as  one, because we are not interested in the  strength of network relationships in the light  of our research question. All indicators repre-  sent formal board mechanisms that facilitate  the external service task of non-executive  directors, i.e. the first indicator represents net-  working and the other two indicators used  represent the presence of financial resource  dependencies at the supervisory board level  (see Table 2).  To portray developments in the internal  service task of non-executive directors, the fol-  lowing indicators were used: (1) the average  number of joint board meetings of non-  executive and executive directors per listed  company, (2) the average number of board  committees per listed company, (3) the average  number of board committee meetings of listed  companies that operate at least one board com-  mittee, and (4) the average size of board com-  mittees of listed companies that operate at least  one board committee. The indicators reflect  characteristics of two formal board communi-  cation mechanisms (joint board meetings and  board committees) that facilitate the internal  service task of non-executive directors, i.e.  providing advice and counselling to executive  directors (see Table 2).  Empirical findings  Developments in the external service  task of non-executive directors  As corporate policy makers in the Netherlands  are concerned with the adverse impact of  board relations on the independence of non-  executive directors, the corporate governance  codes introduced a limitation on the number  of board memberships and a restriction on  resource dependencies within board relation-  ships. Table 5 provides an overview of the  developments with regard to interorganisa-  tional board relations. As shown, the average  number of board relationships has decreased  over time (-34.3 per cent). Interestingly, the  largest drop in the average number of board  ties is observable right after the Tabaksblat  Code became effective: from 6.1 ties in 2003 to  5.0 ties in 2004 (-18.3 per cent). Overall, this  indicates that the potential for board network  benefits is diminishing.  Scholars have noted that financial services  providers often have a central role in the  network of interlocking directorates. These  network relationships provide financial ser-  vices providers an ability to monitor and  control indebted firms, while organisations  may have greater access to financial resources  (Mizruchi, 1996; Pfeffer, 1972). Although  Dutch financial services providers have been  the most highly networked corporations for a  long period, their position has been declining  since 1976 (Heemskerk et al., 2003). The provi-  sions in the Dutch corporate governance codes  seem to have affected their network position  also. Table 5 reveals that the average number  of ties top-100 listed companies have with  listed financial service providers (banks, in-  surance companies and investment funds)  through ties at the supervisory board level  decreased from 0.94 ties in 1997 to 0.66 ties in  2005 (-29.8 per cent). Furthermore, the average  number of board relations focal top-100 listed  companies have with the top-3 listed banks  (ABN Amro, ING, Fortis) through ties at the  supervisory board level decreased from 0.56  ties in 1997 to 0.28 ties in 2005 (-50.0 per cent).  Interestingly, the largest drops in average  numbers of finance-related board relationships  Table 5: The changing external service task of non-executive directors within top-100 listed companies – evidence from the Netherlands  (1997–2005)  Board Mechanisms 1997 2005 % change 1997–2005  1) Average number of ties with top-100 listed firms through supervisory  board ties  7.49a) 4.92a) -34.3*  2) Average number of ties with top-100 financial services providers through  supervisory board ties  0.94a) 0.66a) -29.8*  3) Average number of ties with top-3 listed banks (ING, ABN, Fortis)  through supervisory board ties  0.56a) 0.28a) -50.0*  *T-tests show that the difference is statistically significant at the 0.05-level.  a)Number of cases is 100.  INVESTIGATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SERVICE TASKS 1125  Volume 15 Number 6 November 2007© 2007 The Authors  Journal compilation © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2007  are again observable right after the Tabaksblat  Code became effective.  Developments in the internal service  task of non-executive directors  As noted earlier, the attention paid to the  monitoring task and the independence of non-  executive directors has prevailed in the Neth-  erlands. Corporate policy makers have been  relatively silent about the internal service task  of non-executive directors. Table 6 portrays  the developments of two board mechanisms  that facilitate the internal service task of non-  executive directors: (1) joint board meetings  with executive and non-executive directors,  and (2) board committees (the average num-  ber, number of meetings and size). As shown,  the average number of joint board meetings  increased from 5.9 to 7.0 meetings between  1997 and 2005 (+18.6 per cent). During this  period, the average number of board commit-  tees per company increased as well from 0.67  board committees in 1997 to 1.04 and 1.94  board committees in 2001 and 2005 (+189.6 per  cent). Interestingly, most corporations seem to  have established board committees in anticipa-  tion of the Tabaksblat Code, as the largest  growth in the number of board committees is  observable during the period 2001–2003 and  the trend increasingly flattens thereafter. The  average number of meetings of these board  committees increased from 2.3 to 3.5 times  annually (+36.2 per cent). The average size of  board committees developed differently. Until  2002, the average size decreased from 3.3 to  3.0, while it subsequently increased to 3.5 in  2005 (+4.9 per cent over the period). However,  the change in average committee size  appeared to be not significant.  Conclusions and discussion  Several self-regulatory and legislative corpo-  rate governance initiatives were introduced to  financial markets during the last decade. These  initiatives are important reflections of corpo-  rate governance developments, societal norms  and values and expectations of key stakehold-  ers. Seen from an agency perspective, these  reform initiatives have emphasised the control  task of non-executive directors, while non-  executive directors’ service tasks have not  been in the center of policy makers’ attention.  Archival data of the top-100 listed companies  in the Netherlands between 1997 and 2005  reveal that the two Dutch corporate gover-  nance codes have affected non-executive  directors’ external and internal service tasks.  Non-executive directors in the Netherlands  have become less involved in their external  service task between 1997 and 2005 as:  • the average number of ties with top-100  listed firms through supervisory board ties  decreased significantly (-34 per cent),  • the average number of ties with top-100  listed financial firms through supervisory  board ties decreased significantly (-30 per  cent),  • the average number of ties with top-3 listed  banks (ING, ABN Amro and Fortis) through  supervisory board ties decreased signifi-  cantly (-50 per cent).  At the same time non-executive directors in  the Netherlands have become more involved  in their internal service task between 1997 and  2005 as:  • the number of joint board meetings  increased significantly (+19 per cent),  • the average number of board committees  per company (+190 per cent) and the inten-  sity of their involvement increased signifi-  cantly (+36 per cent).  The changing involvement of non-executive  directors in their external and internal service  tasks in response to corporate governance  reform initiatives has three major implications  Table 6: The changing internal service task of non-executive directors within top-100 listed companies – evidence from the Netherlands  (1997–2005)  Board Mechanisms 1997 2005 % change 1997–2005  1) Average number of joint board meetings per listed company 5.90a) 7.00a) +18.6*  2) Average number of board committees used per listed company 0.67b) 1.94b) +189.6*  3) Average number of board committee meetings of listed companies  that have at least one board committee  2.32c) 3.51c) +36.2*  4) Average size of board committees of listed companies that have at  least one board committee  3.29d) 3.45d) +4.9  *T-tests show that the difference is statistically significant at the 0.05-level.  a)Number of cases is 70 (1997) and 96 (2005); b)Number of cases is 85 (1997) and 100 (2005);c)Number of cases is 14 (1997) and 70 (2005);  36 (1997) and 74 (2005) firms had committees; d)Number of cases is 21 (1997) and 74 (2005); 36 (1997) and 74 (2005) firms had committees.  1126 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  Volume 15 Number 6 November 2007 © 2007 The Authors  Journal compilation © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2007  for non-executive directors and corporations.  First, as the task of providing advice and coun-  selling to executive directors grows in impor-  tance, the scope of board’s responsibilities  broadens and non-executive directors increas-  ingly spent more time and effort on fulfilling  their internal service task adequately. Together  with increasing board liabilities, more pres-  sure is put on the non-executive function  and therefore the pool of willing and well-  qualified non-executive directors becomes  more limited.According to Peij (2005), this will  increasingly lead to a professionalisation of the  non-executive directors’ function in the Neth-  erlands. Second, the changing service position  of non-executives has implications for the  selection of non-executive directors. Instead of  mainly selecting non-executives on the basis of  their external board network position, other  qualifications may become more important.  This suggests that selection criteria such as  the cognitive fit with other board members,  industry experience and decision-making  capabilities will grow in importance in  the near future (Rindova, 1999). Third, the  declining importance of interlocking director-  ates may adversely affect the strategic and  financial performance of listed companies. As  learning opportunities become more scarce  and the management of resource dependen-  cies through board ties becomes more difficult,  corporations have to search for alternative  information means to secure their overall  external network position.  The study has several limitations, but pro-  vides avenues for future research also. First, in  the study we have solely focused on formal  board communication mechanisms associated  with the internal and external service tasks of  supervisory boards. This raises for example  the question how informal board communi-  cation mechanisms relate to these formal  mechanisms. Scholars have for instance noted  that informal board network relations may be  more influential and insular than formal  board network relations (Ghoshal et al., 1994;  Tsai, 2002). Future studies could investigate  whether the development of these informal  board communication mechanisms follows  the same pattern as the development of  formal board mechanisms (see for example  Heemskerk, 2007) and what both develop-  ments jointly imply for board task perfor-  mance and corporate performance.  Second, the board network measures we  used provide no direct evidence on the quality  and importance of board relationships. Com-  panies may have reacted to corporate gover-  nance pressures by disposing non-vital board  relations only. Furthermore, the board network  measures used only take into account board  relationships between top-100 listed corpora-  tions. Increasing levels of internationalisation  at the supervisory board level may have made  the international board network more impor-  tant (the number of foreign non-executive  directors grew from 16.0 per cent in 1997 to  24.6 per cent in 2005 (Spencer Stuart, 2006)),  while board network ties with non-listed cor-  porations may provide valuable alternatives  as well. Future research should take these  issues into consideration when assessing  developments in the board network in the  Netherlands.  Third, the described board developments  might be contingent on the specifics of the cor-  porate governance context in the Netherlands.  Future cross-country research studies could  investigate to which extent the same patterns  are observable in other countries with two-tier  board systems (for instance Germany and  Austria) and in countries with one-tier board  systems (for instance Great Britain and the  United States).  Fourth, the study is silent about the dynamic  processes by which listed companies have  reacted to corporate governance reform initia-  tives and have adapted the external and inter-  nal service tasks. Interestingly, the indicators  show that in the case of board network ties  (Table 5), companies appear to react to code  recommendations afterwards. In the case of  internal communication mechanisms (Table 6),  companies appear to have anticipated the  codes’ recommendations. Future studies app-  lying institutional theory (e.g. Dacin et al.,  2002; Ocasio, 1999) would be valuable to inves-  tigate how corporations in different institu-  tional contexts have responded to corporate  governance reforms. And whether the differ-  ent legal groundings of the Peters Code (self-  regulation) and the Tabaksblat Code (“comply  or explain”) led to different changes and pat-  terns in board practices discussed.  The study indicates that although corporate  governance reforms have mainly emphasised  the control task and independence of non-  executive directors, they seem to have  changed as unintended consequences the  involvement in the external and internal  service tasks of non-executive directors also.  Corporate policy makers should take these  unanticipated effects into account prior to the  introduction of corporate governance reform  initiatives.

The Influence of Top Management Team’s Corporate  Governance Orientation on Strategic Renewal  Trajectories: A Longitudinal Analysis of Royal  Dutch Shell plc, 1907–2004joms_961 984..1014  Zenlin Kwee, Frans A. J. Van Den Bosch and  Henk W. Volberda  Delft University of Technology; Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University; Rotterdam School of  Management, Erasmus University  abstract Using the upper echelons perspective together with corporate governance and  strategic renewal literature, this paper investigates how top managers’ corporate governance  orientation influences a firm’s strategic renewal trajectories over time. Through both a  qualitative analysis (1907–2004) and a quantitative analysis (1959–2004), we investigate this  under-researched question within the context of a large incumbent firm: Royal Dutch Shell  plc. Our results indicate that top managers having an Anglo-Saxon corporate governance  orientation are more likely to pursue exploitative and external-growth strategic renewal  trajectories, while those having a Rhine corporate governance orientation are more likely to  pursue exploratory and internal-growth strategic renewal trajectories. We also found a positive  moderating effect of the proportion of shareholders from the Anglo-Saxon countries on  exploitative and external-growth strategic renewal trajectories. Our findings indicate that top  managers’ corporate governance orientation can be an important antecedent of strategic  renewal and of organizational ambidexterity, both of which influence corporate longevity.  INTRODUCTION  Research on strategic renewal has focused mainly on processes and outcomes of strategic  renewal in large established firms (e.g. Agarwal and Helfat, 2009; Baden-Fuller and  Volberda, 1997; Capron and Mitchell, 2009; Flier et al., 2003; Kim and Pennings, 2009;  Volberda et al., 2001a, 2001b). However, previous research also suggests that current  literature on strategic renewal could benefit from studying the underlying organizational  antecedents of strategic renewal using a longitudinal approach.

Journal of Management Studies 48:5 July 2011  doi: 10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00961.x  This paper intends to contribute to the following two research gaps. First, the role of  top managers and their corporate governance orientation are an underexplored orga-  nizational antecedent of strategic renewal (e.g. Filatotchev et al., 2006; Floyd and Lane,  2000; Hurst et al., 2007; Volberda et al., 2001a). Upper echelons literature pinpoints  that compositional and background characteristics of top managers play a crucial role in  recognizing and pursuing strategic choices (Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Wiersema and  Bantel, 1992). In this research stream, Johnson et al. (2005, p. 171) put forward a  much-neglected question: ‘What is the purpose of a board and their deliberations on  strategy?’ While most studies have focused on linking top managers’ characteristics with  financial performance (e.g. Buyl et al., in press; Certo et al., 2006), few have examined  how these characteristics affect strategic choices and actions (Goodstein and Boeker,  1991; Hambrick, 2007). Carter (2006) and Hambrick (2007) encourage scholars to  explore this research area, particularly factors that influence the way managers interpret  strategic choices they face. We contribute to this research gap by exploring top manag-  ers’ corporate governance orientation as an antecedent of strategic renewal trajectories.  Second, strategic renewal trajectories develop over time (Agarwal and Helfat, 2009;  Chakravarthy and Doz, 1992). This implies that research on strategic renewal requires  a longitudinal approach to investigate successive strategic renewal trajectories of a firm  over the years (Volberda and Lewin, 2003). The number of such empirical studies is  limited (e.g. Burgelman and Grove, 2007; Flier et al., 2003; Jenkins and Floyd, 2001;  Kwee et al., 2008; Uotila et al., 2009; Volberda et al., 2001b). Our study answers this call  for more longitudinal research by investigating strategic renewal trajectories for a period  of almost a century, i.e. 1907–2004.  To address the aforementioned two research gaps, we use the upper echelons  perspective together with corporate governance and strategic renewal literature to  address the research question of how top managers’ corporate governance orientation influences a  firm’s strategic renewal trajectories. To this end, we conducted a longitudinal study of a large  incumbent firm: Royal Dutch Shell plc (Shell).  Shell is an interesting case for studying the evolvement of successive strategic  renewal trajectories for two main reasons. First, during the period 1959–2004, Shell had  a governance structure called ‘Committee of Managing Directors’ (CMD). Under this  structure, Shell was governed by chairmen from either the Dutch (Rhine corporate  governance orientation) or the British (Anglo-Saxon corporate governance orientation)  side of the company. Prior to this period (1907–58), Shell comprised two separate  companies with two separate management boards, i.e. Royal Dutch and Shell Transport  and Trading. It was under the CMD structure that Anglo-Saxon and Rhine corporate  governance orientations were combined and institutionalized. Although these two cor-  porate governance orientations coexisted in the CMD structure, we can determine which  orientation was more dominant at a particular point in time by studying the composition  of top managers in the CMD at that time. This unique governance structure of the CMD  allows us to investigate variation in top managers’ corporate governance orientation  within one firm over time and how such alternating orientation influences the firm’s  strategic renewal trajectories (Filatotchev et al., 2006). A previous study about Shell  by Stadler et al. (2006) has indicated that chief executive officers (CEOs) have their  own preferred governance orientation with British CEOs favouring the Anglo-Saxon  TMT and Strategic Renewal 985  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  corporate governance orientation and European CEOs favouring the Rhine orientation.  However, it remains to be investigated how the variation in governance orientation due  to changes in top managers may influence successive strategic renewal trajectories.  Additionally, while Stadler et al. (2006) focus on CEO level of analysis only and build on  a qualitative case study approach for a much shorter period (in the 1990s), our study is  based on different data by employing both qualitative and quantitative longitudinal  designs with the focus beyond the CEO level of analysis. More specifically, regarding top  managers’ corporate governance orientation as an independent variable, we focus on  two levels of analysis: CEO (i.e. CMD chairmen) and top management team (i.e. CMD members).  Additionally, we incorporate a firm-level measure of the proportion of shareholders based  on geographical distribution as a moderating factor of the relationships between the top  managers’ corporate governance orientation and strategic renewal. Here, the dependent  variables of our study relate to firm-level measures of strategic renewal actions. Through  these multilevel measures, we investigate multilevel interaction effects of top managers’  corporate governance orientation on strategic renewal trajectories.  Second, the long history of Shell’s company records provides a rich dataset of publicly  available data to investigate the firm’s longitudinal strategic renewal trajectories (e.g.  Cummins and Beasant, 2005; Gabriëls and Jongmans, 1990; Gerretson, 1959; Howarth,  1992, 1998; Howarth and Jonker, 2007; Jones, 1977; Jonker and Van Zanden, 2007;  Sluyterman, 2007; Van Zanden, 2007; Yergin, 1993). These public data are enriched  and triangulated by supplementary internal data and by in-depth interviews with both  active and retired top managers of Shell. While the CMD governance structure enables  us to conduct a quantitative study (1959–2004), the rich company records of Shell enable us  to conduct also a qualitative study of the firm’s successive strategic renewal trajectories for  the whole period (1907–2004).  In sum, our research design enables us to make three contributions. First, through  multilevel measures, this paper contributes to both strategic renewal and upper echelons  literature by examining multilevel interaction effects of top managers’ corporate gover-  nance orientation on strategic renewal trajectories. The focus on a single firm in this  paper enables us to investigate these effects, which may be difficult to observe with  comparative case studies or cross-sectional studies involving different firms from different  countries. Second, we contribute to the organizational antecedents of strategic renewal  literature by exploring the role of top managers in regulating the speed, direction, and  trajectory of a firm’s strategic renewal actions (Volberda et al., 2001a). The length of the  period investigated (1907–2004) enables us to contribute to this research stream by  providing a more encompassing investigation of successive strategic renewal trajectories.  Finally, our findings contribute to empirical evidence of the extant corporate governance  literature on the Anglo-Saxon and the Rhine models (e.g. Albert, 1993, 1995; Letza  et al., 2004; O’Sullivan, 2000; Smith, 2003; Tylecote and Conesa, 1999). In particular,  we provide evidence regarding the effects of top managers’ alternating corporate  governance orientations on a single firm’s strategic renewal trajectories.  The paper is structured as follows. First, we provide an overview of the literature on  strategic renewal, upper echelons, and corporate governance models. Subsequently, we  develop our research framework and hypotheses. Next, we describe our research meth-  odology and present our findings. Finally, we conclude by discussing theoretical and  Z. Kwee et al.986  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  managerial implications of our findings and outlining potential directions for future  research.  THEORETICAL OVERVIEW  Theory and Dimensions of Strategic Renewal  Broadly defined, strategic renewal relates to ‘the activities a firm undertakes to alter its  path dependence’ (Volberda et al., 2001a, p. 160) to achieve a fit between the firm and  its environment (Lamberg et al., 2008; Miller, 1992). More recently, Agarwal and Helfat  (2009, p. 282) propose that strategic renewal ‘includes the process, content, and outcome  of refreshment or replacement of attributes of an organization that have the potential to  substantially affect its long-term prospects’.  Key aspects of the definitions of strategic renewal relate to patterns that emerge over a  long period of time resulting from strategic actions that a firm undertakes towards path  dependence or path creation (Garud and Karnøe, 2001; Garud et al., 2010). While path  dependence is associated with exploitation, path creation is associated with explora-  tion (March, 1991). Like organizational ambidexterity, strategic renewal requires both  exploiting existing competencies and exploring new ones (Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004;  Jansen et al., 2009; March, 1991). In this line of inquiry, we study exploitation and  exploration by identifying and analysing realized strategic renewal actions rather than  perceived or planned actions (Mintzberg, 1978; Mintzberg and Waters, 1985). This is  consistent with Volberda et al. (2001a) who investigated strategic renewal trajectories  based on realized strategic renewal actions.  Like other recent studies of a firm’s exploitation and exploration actions (e.g.  Uotila et al., 2009), we build upon the studies of Volberda et al. (2001b) and Flier et al.  (2003) by investigating strategic renewal as a three-dimensional construct, consisting of  content, context and process dimensions. The exploitation and exploration constructs  are related to the content dimension of strategic renewal. Exploratory strategic renewal  actions, indicating initiatives for long-term strategic renewal, are actions such as starting  up new business; launching new products/services, technologies and activities; and  entering new markets or new geographic regions (Cao et al., in press; He and Wong,  2004; Lubatkin et al., 2006; Uotila et al., 2009). Such actions add new activities to the  current repertoire of the organization’s range of activities and competencies or increase  the geographic scope of the firm. In this respect, exploratory strategic renewal actions  create a new path or alter existing paths and are considered to be relatively radical  or discontinuous strategic transformations (Agarwal and Helfat, 2009; March, 1991).  Exploitative strategic renewal actions, however, denote a shorter-term orientation and  consist of actions that focus on the current range of activities within the current geo-  graphic scope of a firm. For instance, exploitative actions include expanding existing  markets, improving existing competencies, and initiating rationalized activities such  as closure, consolidation, or downscoping (Cao et al., in press; He and Wong, 2004;  Lubatkin et al., 2006; Uotila et al., 2009). In this respect, exploitative strategic renewal  actions are path-dependent and associated with incremental renewal (Agarwal and  Helfat, 2009; March, 1991).  TMT and Strategic Renewal 987  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  The context dimension of strategic renewal reflects the interaction of a firm with its  external environment when initiating strategic renewal actions. Do firms originate stra-  tegic renewal actions based on their internal resources or based on external resources and  cooperation with external parties? Here we query the internal- versus external-growth  strategic renewal trajectories (Capron and Mitchell, 2009; Flier et al., 2003; Galunic  and Eisenhardt, 1996). Examples of external-growth strategic renewal actions include  mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures. Internal-growth strategic renewal actions  include internal corporate venturing, launching new products or new services, and  closing product lines or offices.  Finally, the process dimension deals with the temporal processes of strategic renewal  actions and includes the speed and volatility of strategic renewal actions (Flier et al.,  2003). In this respect, a longitudinal research design of sufficient duration is required to  provide process explanations of strategic renewal trajectories (Chakravarthy and Doz,  1992; Pettigrew, 1990).  Top Management as Organizational Antecedent of Strategic Renewal  Recent studies (e.g. Eggers and Kaplan, 2009; Tripsas, 2009) show that the question of  how top management teams of large incumbent firms manage their strategic renewal is  central to both strategy and organizational fields. As mediators between external envi-  ronmental demands and internal organizational dynamics (Keck and Tushman, 1993),  top managers are considered to have latitude of action in making strategic choices  (Hambrick, 2007). Upper echelons literature has emphasized the role of top managers  in strategy formation and the resulting organizational outcomes (Hambrick, 2007;  Hambrick and Mason, 1984). For example, by engaging in external and internal  advice-seeking, top management teams (TMTs) are able to signal internal and external  environmental developments and to influence strategic renewal actions (Alexiev et al.,  in press). At its core, the upper echelons literature is based on the premise that top  managers’ compositional and background characteristics, such as nationality (e.g. Ham-  brick et al., 1998) and functional background (e.g. Carpenter, 2002; Hambrick et al.,  1996), determine their orientation in making strategic choices. Research in this stream  focuses either on CEO- or TMT-level characteristics. Scholars who focus on TMTs  rather than CEOs argue that it is the combined capacity of the members of TMTs that  influences long-term success (Carpenter et al., 2004). However, the interaction between  CEO and TMT is also widely recognized as important (Peterson et al., 2003). TMTs of  large incumbent firms are often not created from scratch, but evolve over time through  replacement of members (Shen and Cannella, 2002). New chairmen may appoint new  members which, in turn, may change the shared context and norms of interaction of a  TMT (Chatman and Flynn, 2001; Harrison et al., 2002). Therefore, in this paper, we  incorporate both TMT- (i.e. Shell’s CMD members) and CEO-level (i.e. the chairman  of the CMD) characteristics.  An important feature of the upper echelons theory is that strategic renewal trajectories  are viewed as reflections of the values and cognitive bases of powerful actors in the  organization. The mix of backgrounds and expertise represented in TMTs relate to their  propensity to pursue certain strategic renewal trajectories. Hambrick and Mason (1984)  Z. Kwee et al.988  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  argue that managers with differing histories of functional experiences are likely to differ  in their attitudes, knowledge, and perspectives. Furthermore, Floyd and Lane (2000)  describe strategic renewal as an intensely social process, involving certain crucial inter-  actions among top management. They contend that given the importance of social  interactions between an organization (through its managers) and its environment,  strategic renewal ‘can be understood best as a system of relational or social exchanges’  (Floyd and Lane, 2000, p. 160).  Top managers need to use their social skills in and around their firms in order to  pursue a strategy effectively. The expectations from society and the values of the man-  agers’ socioeconomic roots may influence their perspectives on how their firms should be  governed, which strategies they should pursue, and how their performance should be  evaluated. Methods of such evaluation vary according to the national systems of cor-  porate governance, i.e. the systems of corporate ownership and control (La Porta et al.,  1997, 1998; Moerland, 1995).  Two types of corporate governance orientation can be distinguished: market-oriented  systems and network-oriented systems (Moerland, 1995). Market-oriented systems are char-  acterized by the so-called Anglo-Saxon model which is prevalent in countries like the United  States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Network-oriented systems are char-  acterized by the continental European models consisting of the Rhine and Latin models  (Albert, 1993; Letza et al., 2004; Moerland, 1995; Smith, 2003). The Rhine model is  prevalent in Germanic countries of continental Europe such as Germany, The Nether-  lands, Switzerland, and Austria; while the Latin model is prevalent in Latinic countries of  the European Community such as Italy, Spain, France, and Belgium (Moerland, 1995).  In this paper, we focus on the Anglo-Saxon and the Rhine models considering that  during the period 1959–2004, these two models were prevalent in Shell’s CMD structure  as an Anglo-Dutch firm operating under English and Dutch law.  These two corporate governance models tend to prioritize key issues differently. The  Anglo-Saxon model is characterized by a one-tier board comprised of both executives  and non-executives. Controlling shareholders appoint directors, executives, and non-  executives (Moerland, 1995). The short-termism of the Anglo-Saxon model directs the  board to focus on shareholder value through dynamic market orientation and a fluid  capital investment system (Lazonick and O’Sullivan, 2000; O’Sullivan, 2000). Such  attributes are related to the common law system, majoritarian electoral system, and a  liberal market economy that tend to offer strong investor/shareholder protection but less  strong employment protection (Bebchuk and Roe, 1999; Hall and Gingerich, 2009; La  Porta et al., 1997, 1998; Pagano and Volpin, 2005). Moerland (1995, p. 29) points out  the danger of the Anglo-Saxon short-termism that ‘managers may bother so much about  presenting favourable financial results in the short run that they overlook the importance  of basic investments to sustain the firm’s performance in the long run’. This short-  termism may influence managers to neglect long-term investments (Stein, 1988). In this  model, financial performance indicators are mainly based on property or other tangible  assets rather than firm-specific intangible assets such as employee knowledge.  By contrast, the Rhine model is characterized by a two-tier board structure con-  sisting of an executive board and a supervisory board (Maassen and Bosch, 2002;  Moerland, 1995). The executive board consists of the top-level management team, while  TMT and Strategic Renewal 989  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  the supervisory board comprises outside non-executives, such as bankers, executives  from other corporations (e.g. interlocking directorship), and employee representatives.  Boards operating under this model are expected to focus on stakeholder value in the  context of a dedicated capital investment system. The Rhine model adopts the civil law  system, proportional electoral system, and a coordinated market economy that tends  to offer strong employment protection and less strong shareholder protection compared  to the Anglo-Saxon model (Bebchuk and Roe, 1999; Hall and Gingerich, 2009; La  Porta et al., 1997, 1998; Pagano and Volpin, 2005). Unlike the short-termism of the  Anglo-Saxon model, the Rhine model is associated with a more long-term orientation  (Albert, 1995; Freeman, 1984). Besides tangible assets, Rhine managers tend to use  intangible assets such as employee knowledge to gauge firm performance. Table I sum-  marizes the main differences between these two models.  In an international setting, corporate governance varies among countries with respect  to their historical origins, their methods of capital mobilization, and their structures  of ownership and control (La Porta et al., 1997; Moerland, 1995). Those varying insti-  tutional settings raise a number of interesting questions concerning the relationships  between institutional differences and corporate behaviour, like strategic renewal and  firm performance (Pugliese et al., 2009).

Kwee et al.990  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  During the period investigated (1907–2004), Shell had two parent companies: Royal  Dutch (RD) and Shell Transport and Trading (STT). Legally, the company was embed-  ded in two countries: The Netherlands (associated with the Rhine model), and the UK  (associated with the Anglo-Saxon model). Prior to the firm’s unification in 2005, Shell  had no American-style CEO (Sluyterman, 2007). The unique leadership structure of  Shell can be distinguished in two periods: the period before the introduction of Com-  mittee of Managing Directors (CMD) (i.e. 1907–58), and the period from the start of the  CMD until the unification (i.e. 1959–2004).  RESEARCH FRAMEWORK AND HYPOTHESES  We conducted two studies: (1) a qualitative study of the exploitative and external-growth  strategic renewal trajectories of Shell for the whole period of 1907–2004; and (2) a  quantitative study of the influence of top managers’ governance orientation on strategic  renewal trajectories during Shell’s CMD period (1959–2004). For the quantitative study,  we developed a research framework as depicted in Figure 1. This research framework  comprises three main constructs: top managers’ corporate governance orientation as an  organizational antecedent of strategic renewal; the moderating role of the geographical  distribution of shareholders; and the resulting strategic renewal trajectories. With respect  to top managers’ governance orientation, we develop measures at two levels: CEO (i.e.  CMD chairman) and top management team (i.e. CMD members). These measures  include top managers’ background characteristics, i.e. nationality and functional back-  ground. Next, with regard to the moderating variable, we incorporate a firm-level  measure by using the proportion of the geographical distribution of Shell’s shareholders  from Anglo-Saxon countries. The methodology section elaborates the measures in more  detail.  Figure 1. Research framework for examining the influence of top managers’ corporate governance orien-  tation on strategic renewal trajectories during the period of Shell’s CMD (1959–2004)  TMT and Strategic Renewal 991  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  Note that for the quantitative study, we focus on one of the two discerned models of  corporate governance orientation, i.e. the Anglo-Saxon and Rhine models. However, as  the Anglo-Saxon and the Rhine models are effectively opposites for the purposes of  this study (see Table I), the results of the Anglo-Saxon corporate governance orientation  also reflect the opposite results regarding the Rhine orientation. Therefore, to limit the  number of hypotheses, we test the hypotheses only for the Anglo-Saxon corporate  governance orientation.  One of the critical TMT background characteristics is the nationality of top managers.  Hambrick et al. (1998) observe that nationality affects a person’s underlying values and  cognitive schema which, in turn, affect one’s behaviour as well as how the person is  perceived in a multinational group. Top managers’ deeply-rooted values and cognitions  influence their perceptions during the decision-making process ‘because their values  frame how they make sense of the organizational environment and their ensuing actions’  (Clark and Soulsby, 2007, p. 948). These values are expected to vary on a continuum  anchored, at one end, by the Anglo-Saxon corporate governance orientation and, at the  other end, by the Rhine corporate governance orientation (Wood, 1994). In Shell’s  context, although both models of corporate governance orientation coexisted in the  CMD, the two orientations tended to wax and wane in dominance over time as com-  position of top managers in the CMD evolved. CMD chairmen or members from  countries associated with the Anglo-Saxon corporate governance orientation (e.g. UK,  USA) are more likely to exert the influence of the short-termism corporate governance  orientation than those from countries associated with the Rhine orientation (e.g. The  Netherlands, Germany). For instance, Aguilera and Jackson (2003, pp. 460–1) note that  ‘whereas the dominance of functional orientations among German managers helps  balance financial and strategic interests, U.S. managers are mostly aligned with share-  holders’ financial interests’. The more dominant Anglo-Saxon corporate governance  orientation may, in turn, make managers more myopic and likely to sacrifice long-term  investments to boost short-term profits for shareholders (Stein, 1988). For example,  managers may sell off productive assets that have an immediate impact on the firm’s  profit and stock values. Such a focus on financial performance may result in managers  cutting research and development expenditures or investments in employee knowledge.  This reflects exploitative strategic renewal trajectories. As such, we hypothesize that:  Hypothesis 1a: Top managers from countries associated with the Anglo-Saxon corpo-  rate governance orientation are more likely to pursue exploitative strategic renewal  trajectories than those from countries associated with the Rhine corporate governance  orientation.  Additionally, under the common law marked by strong investor protection, managers  from the Anglo-Saxon countries are more familiar with equity finance than those from  the civil law (Rhine) countries (La Porta et al., 1997, 1998). With larger equity markets,  fluid capital markets are more tolerant of mergers and acquisitions, including hostile  takeovers, than the more dedicated capital markets that characterize the Rhine model  (see Table I). As such, managers from the Anglo-Saxon countries tend to be more  familiar with mergers and acquisitions than those from the Rhine countries, allowing  Z. Kwee et al.992  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  them to more easily access different technologies by acquiring other firms or engaging  in short-term strategic collaboration with other firms (Hall and Gingerich, 2009). Such  activities are associated with external-growth strategic renewal trajectories. Based on this  line of reasoning, we hypothesize that:  Hypothesis 1b: Top managers from countries associated with the Anglo-Saxon cor-  porate governance orientation are more likely to pursue external-growth strategic  renewal trajectories than those from countries associated with the Rhine corporate  governance orientation.  Previous studies have shown that functional backgrounds affect managers’ percep-  tions, attitudes, and knowledge (Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Waller et al., 1995), which  in turn influence their strategic choices. In this connection, Bouwman (2009) argues  that due to social network effects, directors may exert influence on a firm’s governance  practices causing such practices to be propagated across the firm. The direction of this  influence depends on the previous experience of the individual TMT member. As such,  we adopt Canella et al.’s (2008, p. 769) definition of dominant functional background:  ‘the functional area in which each TMT member has spent the most time’.  Hambrick and Mason (1984, p. 199) identify three functional categories: output  functions (e.g. marketing, sales, and product R&D), throughput functions (e.g.  production/operation, finance and accounting), and peripheral/non-core functions (e.g.  law). Considering that during the period of investigation, Shell’s top managers consis-  tently had functional backgrounds associated with the firm’s core activities, we focus only  on two of these functional categories: output and throughput functions. Output-function  managers tend to have higher levels of corporate social performance and tend to be more  sensitive to stakeholders than throughput-function managers (Simerly, 2003). In contrast,  since throughput-function managers face more intense pressure related to financial issues  than output-function ones, throughput-function managers tend to be more attuned to  efficiency and profitability and tend to focus more on short-term rather than long-term  performance measures (Hall and Gingerich, 2009; Hayes and Abernathy, 1980). This  suggests that throughput-function managers are likely to be associated with the Anglo-  Saxon corporate governance orientation, while output-function managers with their  focus on stakeholders and long-term performance measures are likely to be associated  with the Rhine corporate governance orientation. Therefore, we hypothesize that:  Hypothesis 2a: Top managers with functional backgrounds associated with the Anglo-  Saxon corporate governance orientation (i.e. throughput functions) are more likely  to pursue exploitative strategic renewal trajectories than those with functional  backgrounds associated with the Rhine corporate governance orientation (i.e. output  functions).  Furthermore, influenced by the fluid capital system of the Anglo-Saxon model,  throughput-function managers are more familiar with and tend to rely more heavily on  extensive equity markets for their investments than output-function managers (La Porta  et al., 1997). As such, in comparison with output-function managers, throughput-function  TMT and Strategic Renewal 993  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  managers tend to engage in activities such as mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers to  promote rapid achievement of high profitability (Hall and Gingerich, 2009). Related  to this argument, Finkelstein (1992) has found that the greater the proportion of TMT  members with finance backgrounds, which is a throughput function, the more acquisitions  firms make. Accordingly, we hypothesize that:  Hypothesis 2b: Top managers with functional backgrounds associated with the Anglo-  Saxon corporate governance orientation (i.e. throughput functions) are more likely  to pursue external-growth strategic renewal trajectories than those with functional  backgrounds associated with the Rhine corporate governance orientation (i.e. output  functions).  The proportion of the geographical distribution of shareholders from the Anglo-Saxon  countries is likely to moderate the direct effect of the TMT’s corporate governance  orientation on a firm’s strategic renewal actions. Since this moderating variable focuses  on shareholders by country, we investigate the interaction effect between this variable  and top managers’ nationalities. The argument here is that the larger the proportion of  shareholders from the Anglo-Saxon countries, the stronger the focus on shareholder  values which, in turn, may increase pressure on managers to pursue short-term profit-  ability (Bebchuk and Roe, 1999; Pagano and Volpin, 2005). In this respect, top managers  from countries associated with the Anglo-Saxon corporate governance orientation tend  to be more willing to cater to shareholders’ demands for greater profits as compared to  top managers from countries associated with the Rhine orientation. Based on these  arguments, we hypothesize that:  Hypothesis 3a: The proportion of shareholders from Anglo-Saxon countries positively  moderates the relationship between top managers from countries associated with the  Anglo-Saxon corporate governance orientation and the likelihood of them pursuing  exploitative strategic renewal trajectories.  Likewise, the larger the proportion of shareholders from the Anglo-Saxon countries,  the stronger the tendency to encourage managers to engage in activities such as mergers  and acquisitions. In comparison with Rhine managers, Anglo-Saxon managers tend to  be more responsive to this propensity for external alliances. As such, we hypothesize that:  Hypothesis 3b: The proportion of shareholders from the Anglo-Saxon countries posi-  tively moderates the relationship between top managers from countries associated  with the Anglo-Saxon corporate governance orientation and the likelihood of them  pursuing external-growth strategic renewal trajectories.  RESEARCH SETTING  A Brief Overview of Shell’s History and Management Structure, 1907–2004  Royal Dutch Shell plc was formed in 1907 after a well-documented Anglo-Dutch  alliance between the UK-based ‘Shell’ Transport and Trading Company plc and The  Z. Kwee et al.994  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  Netherlands-based Royal Dutch Petroleum Company (Howarth, 1998; Jonker and Van  Zanden, 2007). Instead of forming one company with one set of shareholders, the Royal  Dutch/Shell Group was established as a joint venture between two companies and two  groups of shareholders. The Royal Dutch Petroleum Company (RD), based in The  Hague and listed on the Dutch stock exchange, owned a 60 per cent interest in the  Group. Shell Transport and Trading plc (STT), headquartered in London and listed on  the London stock exchange, owned a 40 per cent interest in the Group.  In the period 1907–58, preceding the introduction of the CMD governance structure,  RD and STT were legally two separate companies with separate boards, operating under  Dutch and English law, respectively (Howarth and Jonker, 2007; Jonker and Van  Zanden, 2007). Under Dutch law, RD had a two-tier structure with both a supervisory  board and a management board, consistent with the Rhine model. Operating under the  British corporate system, STT had a unitary board with a non-executive chairman, a  majority of non-executives, and a minority of executives, consistent with the Anglo-  Saxon model. During this period, both RD and STT had their own leaders: the president  of the management board of RD and the chairman of the board of STT, respectively.  Due to the World War II, in particular during 1941–46, no president of RD was  appointed. Instead, managing directors were in charge of RD. Note that the separate  management boards make it difficult to investigate the influence of a ‘collective’ board on  Shell’s strategic renewal trajectories during this period. Therefore, we test our research  hypotheses only for the period 1959–2004, when Shell’s joint Committee of Managing  Directors (CMD) was in existence.  In 1959, Shell introduced the CMD governance structure. This was due to a profound  reorganization initiated by RD president, John Hugo Loudon, who approached an  external consultant in July 1957 to review the firm’s management structure (Howarth  and Jonker, 2007). The review was presented in August 1958 and led to a remodelling of  the organization introduced on 15 January 1959 (Howarth and Jonker, 2007). That  reorganization profoundly changed both the positions of the top managers and the  relations between Shell and its operating companies (Howarth and Jonker, 2007).  Although both RD and STT maintained their own president/chairman and boards, the  CMD acted as a joint top management team drawn from both RD and STT. The  chairman of the CMD could either be the president of the management board of RD or  the chairman of the board of STT. The division in time between Dutch and British  leadership more or less reflected the 60–40 per cent shares in the Group (Sluyterman,  2007). Nevertheless, the proportion of the CMD members from RD and from STT  varied over time. Table II lists Shell’s CMD chairmen from 1959 to 2004 with their  background characteristics.  During the 1980s and 1990s, when competition intensified and the environment  changed, Shell stepped back from its diversified and decentralized strategy (Sluyterman,  2007). For example, in 1997, the Shell Oil Company in the USA was integrated into the  group. In 2004, Shell’s reputation suffered from the overestimation of oil reserves  (Cummins and Beasant, 2005). Ultimately, this major event and other internal distur-  bances led to the unification of Shell. At two shareholder meetings on 28 June 2005,  a large majority of shareholders voted for the unification proposal of Royal Dutch  and Shell Transport. Incorporated in England and Wales, and headquartered in The  TMT and Strategic Renewal 995  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  Netherlands (The Hague), Royal Dutch Shell plc was born (Sluyterman, 2007). Follow-  ing the incorporation of Royal Dutch Shell plc in 2005, Shell merged the Group’s  dual-ownership structure (Sluyterman, 2007). Under this new structure, the CMD struc-  ture was abolished and the company now operates with a unitary board and the  leadership of a CEO.  RESEARCH METHODS  Data Collection and Coding Technique  Our data was collected from Shell’s public sources comprising the annual reports of the  board and company documents chronicling the history of Shell, publications on the  history of Shell, industry publications, and other written materials from the period  1907–2004. In addition to the archival data collection, we conducted a series of retro-  spective interviews from December 2006 to December 2007 with 16 active senior and  top managers of Shell from different divisions and with four retired top managers. The  longest tenure of the top managers we interviewed is around 40 years, enabling us to  obtain qualitative historical evidence about the early years of the CMD structure in the  1960s. The duration of the interviews ranges from one hour to two hours. All interviews  were taped and were then transcribed, resulting in 118 double-spaced pages of text. We  used the insights from these interviews, in addition to records from secondary data  sources, to triangulate our initial coding.  We employed a structured content analysis technique ( Jauch et al., 1980; Weber,  1990) to code Shell’s strategic renewal actions reported in the company’s annual reports.  Table II.

Z. Kwee et al.996  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  According to Kimberley and Miles (1980), historical records of actions actually taken by  an organization are often the most accurate source of their strategic decisions. To analyse  the content of strategic renewal actions, we developed a manual describing key coding  rules (see Appendix). The manual provides a systematic procedure to analyse strategic  renewal actions of Shell and to consistently categorize each of the relevant strategic  action based on the defined coding rules. To perform this procedure, we electronically  scanned 4594 pages of Shell’s annual reports. We cross-checked a random subset of the  reported strategic renewal actions with external sources such as books, journals, and  other publicly accessible documents.  The coding was performed by a team of three researchers. Researcher 1 read and  coded strategic renewal actions in the annual reports for the whole period of study  (1907–2004). Using the same coding manual, two other researchers, respectively, coded  20 years of the annual reports, divided in two periods, i.e. 1976–85 and 1995–2004. The  coders coded realized strategic renewal actions and categorized each action into two  (content and context) dimensions: exploration versus exploitation and external versus  internal growth action (see Table III). The three coders agreed on 439 of the 491  strategic renewal actions (89.4 per cent) identified from the selected 20 years of annual  reports. This resulted in a Cohen’s kappa of 0.82, which indicates high inter-coder  reliability (Weber, 1990). The different coding results among the coders were primarily  due to the coder overlooking some of the realized strategic renewal actions. These  discrepancies were then discussed and resolved using the coding rules in the manual as  a guideline. Table III shows three illustrative examples of the coding results. We specified  the year, paragraph, and page number of the annual report in which a strategic renewal  action was reported. In some cases, there were cross-page references found. For instance,  the general description of the realized strategic renewal actions reported in the Executive  Summary page of the annual report was mentioned in more detail in the later page(s)  of the annual report.  Measures  Dependent variables. Regarding the content dimension, we calculated the exploitation ratio  by dividing the number of exploitative strategic renewal actions by the total number of  exploitative and exploratory strategic renewal actions. As for the context dimension, we  calculated the external ratio by dividing the number of external-growth strategic renewal  actions by the total number of internal- and external-growth strategic renewal actions.  The two dependent variables relate to the exploitative and external-growth strategic  renewal trajectories, respectively. These variables are quantified for the whole period,  1907–2004.  Independent variables. Independent variables are indicators of the overall corporate  governance orientation of Shell’s CMD chairmen and members. These indicators  represent top managers’ background characteristics as described in upper echelons  theory (e.g. Carpenter, 2002; Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Wiersema and Bantel,  1992). We obtained this data from various sources: Shell’s Annual Reports, Howarth  and Jonker (2007), Sluyterman (2007), and Shell’s Who’s Who system.

Z. Kwee et al.998  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  Hambrick’s (2007) suggestion to incorporate temporal lags, we lagged all indepen-  dent, moderating and control variables by one year to take into account the lagged  effect of realized strategic renewal actions initiated by top managers. Two indepen-  dent variables are used. The first independent variable relates to nationality. For the  CEO-level measures, we categorize the chairmen of the CMD with respect to nation-  ality by using a binary code. For the TMT-level measures, we calculate the propor-  tion of the CMD members (excluding the chairmen) from Anglo-Saxon countries.  The second independent variable relates to functional backgrounds. At the CEO  level, i.e. the chairmen of the CMD, we use the measure of the dominant functional  backgrounds of CMD chairmen. According to Howarth and Jonker (2007) and  Sluyterman (2007, p. 279), Shell’s CMD chairmen can be divided into five functio-  nal background categories: (1) general management and administration, (2) personnel,  (3) finance, (4) upstream, and (5) downstream. The first three functions fall into the  category of throughput functions consisting of operation, finance, and accounting  (Hambrick and Mason, 1984). Since upstream function relies heavily on research  and development activities and downstream function relates to sales and market-  ing activities, upstream and downstream can be categorized as output functions con-  sisting of R&D, sales, and marketing (Hambrick and Mason, 1984). Based on this  breakdown, we categorize the CMD chairmen according to functional backgrounds  associated with either the Anglo-Saxon corporate governance orientation (i.e. through-  put functions) or the Rhine corporate governance orientation (i.e. output functions). At  the TMT level, we calculate the proportion of CMD members with Anglo-Saxon  functional backgrounds by dividing the number of CMD members (excluding the  chairmen) with the throughput-oriented functional backgrounds by the total number  of CMD members.  Moderating variable. Using data obtained from Shell’s annual reports of the period 1959–  2004, triangulated with the data collected by Sluyterman (2007), we calculated the  proportion of Shell shareholders from Anglo-Saxon countries. We use this proportion  as a moderating variable, lagged by one year. As the moderating variable focuses on  shareholders by country, we investigate the interaction effect between this variable and  top managers’ nationalities at the level of CMD members.  Control variables. We use control variables specific to the oil industry. The control vari-  ables are lagged by one year. First, oil prices are used to control for environmental  dynamism in the oil industry. We use oil prices adjusted for inflation based on $2007  prices, as reported in BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy 2008. Second, we follow  Matusik and Hill (1998), defining environmental competitiveness as the extent to which  external environments are characterized by intense competition. To this end, we used  competitive diversity (Ferrier et al., 1999) which is the inverse of the concentration ratio  computed as the percentage of market share held by the four largest firms in the oil  industry (C4). The market share data is based on work by Van Zanden (2007) and the  Thomson One Banker database.  TMT and Strategic Renewal 999  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  ANALYSES AND RESULTS  Qualitative Study: 1907–2004  To structure the analysis of strategic renewal actions for the whole period 1907–2004, we  divided the total 98-year period into five meaningful periods: (1) the early period of Shell,  World War I, and the post-war period (1907–26); (2) the pre-war period and World War  II (1927–46); (3) the post-war period until the mid-1960s, including the reorganization  that led to the creation of Shell’s CMD (1947–66); (4) the period of staying competitive  and dealing with OPEC pricing policy (1967–86); and (5) the turbulent period that led to  the incorporation of Royal Dutch Shell plc (1987–2004).  Table IV presents the average of strategic renewal actions for the five successive  periods. For the content and context dimensions, we computed the exploitation ratio,  exploration ratio, external ratio, and internal ratio. For the process dimension, we  computed the frequency/speed (average strategic renewal actions in 20-year periods)  and volatility (standard deviation) of strategic renewal actions. Three main long-term  trends in strategic renewal appear in Table IV. First, the exploration ratio increased until  the mid-1960s and subsequently decreased, i.e. a long-run change occurred from an  exploratory strategic renewal trajectory towards an exploitative strategic renewal trajec-  tory. Second, the internal ratio was high until World War II, and thereafter lower and  relatively stable. Third, the frequency of strategic renewal actions increased over time;  the volatility was highest in the period after World War II until the mid-1980s, before  slightly decreasing in the period 1987–2004. Below, we highlight interesting develop-  ments for a few periods and relate these to indicators of top managers’ corporate  governance orientation.  Regarding external-growth strategic renewal trajectories, Table IV shows that Shell’s  external ratio generally decreased during the period 1927–46. This could be attributed  to the environmental turbulence due to the Great Depression in the 1930s and World  War II. During these turbulent times, the firm was relatively cautious in initiating or  forming external alliances. The period 1967–86 shows the highest external ratio, indi-  cating that Shell was focused on growth through externally-oriented initiatives such as  mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, and alliances. In the period 1987–2004, there was  a slight drop in the external ratio due to intensified competition in the oil industry, which  prompted Shell reduce to its diversification through external growth (Sluyterman, 2007).  The most explorative period of strategic renewal appears to have been the period  1947–66. Although World War II was an important environmental shock in the corpo-  rate landscape of the oil and gas industry, Shell appeared to grasp opportunities in the  wake of the war through numerous diversified initiatives outside its core business in oil  (Howarth, 1998; Howarth and Jonker, 2007; Yergin, 1993). This historical evidence is  corroborated by the insight from one of our interviews. During the interview, a retired  top manager indicated that in the 1960s, Shell’s focus on stakeholders (associated with  the Rhine corporate governance orientation; see Table I) was stronger than its focus on  shareholders, encouraging the firm to focus on long-term explorations.  In my early years at Shell that was in the 1960s, I remember that the top managers had  a view of employees come first then shareholders. Shell highly valued the contribution  Z.

Of course, as a profit-oriented company, focusing on profit maximiza-  tion or shareholder values was also an important agenda for managers but not their  first and foremost priority. (Interview with a former top manager of Shell, 4 August  2007)  We found support for this statement from the historical archive at Shell, i.e. in the  CMD Minutes of Meeting dated 4 May 1971: ‘In the late 1960s, shareholders did not  necessarily come first’ (Shell’s CMD files, DCS, S65). The CMD chairmen during the  1960s were presidents of RD, J. H. Loudon and L. E. J. Brouwer; both were Dutchmen  with upstream (output-function) backgrounds (see Table II).  In the period 1967–86, Shell’s exploitative strategic renewal trajectory demonstrated  an increasing trend. This trend reflected the environmental turbulence of the time, due  to the energy crisis in 1973 and OPEC pricing policy from 1973 to 1986, which increased  the firm’s propensity to pursue exploitative strategic renewal actions. The decreasing  trend of Shell’s exploratory strategic renewal trajectories in the period 1987–2004  indicates a tendency of the company to focus more on improving existing competencies  rather than building new competencies. This coincides with the shift towards a stronger  emphasis on shareholder values.  In the annual reports, the shift towards paying more explicit attention to shareholders  was noticeable. For instance, the report of 1988 mentioned ‘the endeavour to maintain  profitability to provide value to shareholders’ (p. 3), followed by the view in 1993 that  ‘return on capital employed is our key profitability criterion’ (p. 1). This signifies a strong  orientation towards the Anglo-Saxon model. The following interview quotes reflect  this shift:  I think if we look back until, say 1990s, the shareholders were there and they were very  much respected. But the shareholders didn’t have a lot of influence before they got a  lot more influence in the mid-1990s. (Interview with a current top manager of Shell,  14 May 2007)  In my view, the shareholder orientation was particularly very strong in the mid 90s. We  became more Anglo-Saxon. The peak of this orientation occurred at the integration of  Shell Oil in 1997. (Interview with a former top manager of Shell, 29 March 2007)  Additionally, one of the top managers of Shell shared with us his experience of  the difference between being led by a British chairman and by a Dutch chairman. He  pointed out that he could see there was a shift towards a stronger shareholder emphasis  when the chairman of CMD was a Briton:  When the Dutch was in charge, there was a strong commitment to long-term tech-  nological excellence in the Shell culture. But when the Briton was in charge, the rising  demands and pressures of shareholders were emphasized. The system of performance-  related payment was created. But this transformation process did not go smoothly as  it did not fit with the previous Dutchman values which were so pervasive in the Shell  culture. (Interview with a current top manager of Shell, 3 April 2007)  Z. Kwee et al.1002  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  For the period of the 1960s until the unification, the triangulation of the above  qualitative historical evidence with our hypotheses indicates that top managers with the  Anglo-Saxon corporate governance orientation are more likely to pursue exploitative  and external-growth strategic renewal trajectories than those with the Rhine orientation.  This qualitative inference will be tested in the following quantitative study.  Quantitative Study: 1959–2004  Descriptive statistics are shown in Table V. To examine the issue of multicollinearity,  we calculated variance inflation factors (VIF) for each of the regression equations. The  calculated VIF values range from 2.3 to 2.9, thus well below the rule-of-thumb cut-off  of 10 (Hair et al., 1998). Table VI provides the results of our hierarchical regression  analyses.  The baseline models (Models 1 and 4) contain the control variables. Models 2 and 5  incorporate the CEO- and TMT-level variables of top managers’ Anglo-Saxon corpo-  rate governance orientation regarding exploitative and external-growth strategic renewal  trajectories, respectively. Models 3 and 6 examine the moderating effect of shareholders  from Anglo-Saxon countries on exploitative and external-growth strategic renewal  trajectories.  Model 2 investigates the effect of top managers’ Anglo-Saxon corporate governance  orientation on exploitative strategic renewal trajectories. First, regarding top managers’  nationality, Model 2 shows that the coefficients of the CMD members and chairmen for  exploitative strategic renewal trajectories are positive and significant (b of CMD = 0.142,  p < 0.01; b of chairman = 0.136, p < 0.05). Thus, Hypothesis 1a, which relates top  managers from countries associated with the Anglo-Saxon corporate governance orien-  tation to exploitative strategic renewal trajectories, is supported. Second, regarding  functional backgrounds, the coefficients of the CMD members and chairmen for exploit-  ative strategic renewal trajectories are positive and significant (b of CMD = 0.143,  p < 0.01; b of chairman = 0.135, p < 0.05). Thus, Hypothesis 2a, which relates top  managers with throughput-oriented functional backgrounds to exploitative strategic  renewal trajectories, is also supported. Overall, these findings suggest that top managers’  Anglo-Saxon corporate governance orientation by nationality and functional back-  grounds relate positively to the extent to which managers pursue exploitative strategic  renewal trajectories.  Model 5 investigates the effect of top managers’ Anglo-Saxon corporate governance  orientation on external-growth strategic renewal trajectories. Regarding the nationality  of top managers, the coefficients for external-growth strategic renewal trajectories are  positive and significant both for the CMD- and the chairman-level variables (b of  CMD = 0.153, p < 0.001; b of chairman = 0.156, p < 0.001). Thus, Hypothesis 1b,  regarding external-growth strategic renewal trajectories for top managers of Anglo-  Saxon nationality, is supported. Regarding functional backgrounds, the coefficients  for external-growth strategic renewal trajectories are positive and significant for both  the CMD- and the chairman-level variables (b of CMD = 0.140, p < 0.05; b of chair-  man = 0.138, p < 0.05). This supports Hypothesis 2b that top managers with throughput  functional backgrounds are more likely to pursue external-growth strategic renewal  TMT and Strategic Renewal 1003  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  T  ab  le  V  .

In sum, our findings indicate that by nationality and functional backgrounds,  managers with an Anglo-Saxon corporate governance orientation are more likely to  pursue external-growth strategic renewal trajectories than those with a Rhine corporate  governance orientation.  Model 3 examines the moderating effect of proportion of shareholders from Anglo-  Saxon countries on exploitative strategic renewal trajectories. The interaction between  this variable and the Anglo-Saxon CMD variable increases the extent to which top  managers pursue exploitative strategic renewal trajectories, as the coefficient is positive  and significant (b = 0.147, p < 0.01). Hypothesis 3a is thus supported. Model 6 investi-  gates the moderating effect of the proportion of shareholders from Anglo-Saxon coun-  tries on external-growth strategic renewal trajectories. The interaction between this  variable and the Anglo-Saxon CMD variable strengthens the extent to which top  managers pursue external growth as the coefficient is positive and significant (b = 0.143,  p < 0.01). This result supports Hypothesis 3b.  For further analysis, we perform an equal-period comparison. Specifically, we focus on  the period 1985–92 during the chairmanship of the CMD by a Royal Dutch executive  (Lo van Wachem) and on the periods 1992–93 and 1998–2002 during the chairmanship  of Shell Transport & Trading executives (Peter Holmes, Mark Moody-Stuart, and Phil  Watts). See Table II for a chronology of the Shell chairmanship. In selecting these years,  we also take into account the period following 1997 when Shell Oil Company in the  USA was integrated into the group. This integration understandably increased the  Anglo-Saxon orientation of Shell. Table VII shows the results of the computed average  exploitation and external ratios during the two different leaderships of the CMD at Shell  and the associated corporate governance orientation.  As shown, the extent to which Shell’s managers pursued exploitative strategic renewal  was higher during the STT chairmanship (average exploitation ratio = 0.65) than during  RD chairmanship (average exploitation ratio = 0.51). The difference of the average  exploitation ratio between the two chairmanships is significant (t-value = 2.35, p < 0.05).  This finding concurs with our previous findings in support of Hypotheses 1a and 2a.  However, with this smaller sample size, the difference between the external ratios under  RD versus STT chairmanship is not significant.  Table VII.

Kwee et al.1006  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  While most research on strategic renewal focuses on processes and outcomes of strategic  renewal with fairly short durations, little attention has been paid to (1) organizational  antecedents of strategic renewal, and (2) taking a longitudinal approach. This paper  intends to address these two research gaps by investigating top managers’ corporate  governance orientation as an antecedent of strategic renewal over an extended period  of time.  To this end, we conducted two studies. First, we undertook a qualitative study of  Shell’s strategic renewal trajectories from 1907 until 2004. This resulted in a longitudinal  analysis of strategic renewal actions, including qualitative evidence regarding the influ-  ence of corporate governance orientation on strategic renewal. Second, we conducted a  quantitative study to investigate the influence of top managers’ corporate governance  orientation on strategic renewal by focusing on the unique governance structure of  Shell’s Committee of Managing Directors (CMD) that existed from 1959 to 2004. The  CMD structure provides a unique opportunity to investigate how alternating corporate  governance orientation of top managers within one firm can result in different strategic  choices that alter the firm’s strategic renewal trajectories (Filatotchev et al., 2006). To  analyse this phenomenon, we investigated multilevel interaction effects of top managers’  corporate governance orientation on strategic renewal using multilevel measures.  We developed and tested three hypotheses resulting in the following empirical find-  ings. First, we found support for our hypothesis that top managers with an Anglo-Saxon  corporate governance orientation are more likely to pursue exploitative strategic renewal  trajectories than those with a Rhine corporate governance orientation due to their  greater emphasis on short-term shareholder values. Our results by top managers’ nation-  ality (Hypothesis 1a) and functional backgrounds (Hypothesis 2a) support this hypothesis.  Second, our findings by top managers’ nationality (Hypothesis 1b) and functional back-  grounds (Hypothesis 2b) indicate that top managers with an Anglo-Saxon corporate  governance orientation are more likely to pursue external-growth strategic renewal  trajectories than those with a Rhine corporate governance orientation. Finally, we  examined the moderating effects of the proportion of shareholders from Anglo-Saxon  countries on exploitative and external-growth strategic renewal trajectories. The results  show that this moderating variable strengthens the relationship between top managers’  Anglo-Saxon corporate governance orientation and the extent to which they pursue  exploitative (Hypothesis 3a) and external-growth (Hypothesis 3b) strategic renewal  trajectories.  In sum, the extensive scope of the longitudinal analysis of Shell’s strategic renewal  trajectories provides three main contributions. First, we contribute to the upper echelon  research by examining multilevel interaction effects of top managers’ corporate gover-  nance orientation on strategic renewal trajectories (Pelled et al., 1999). Second, we  contribute to the longitudinal study of organizational antecedents of strategic renewal by  studying the role of top managers’ corporate governance orientation in shaping strategic  renewal trajectories (Filatotchev et al., 2006; Volberda et al., 2001a). This finding also  has implications for the organizational ambidexterity literature (Raisch et al., 2009) and  for sustained strategic renewal research, i.e. corporate longevity (Kwee et al., 2008), by  TMT and Strategic Renewal 1007  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  highlighting a new antecedent. Finally, we contribute to new empirical evidence regard-  ing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon and the Rhine models of corporate governance by  studying the effects of top managers within one firm alternating between these two  models over time ( Albert, 1993; Judge, 2010). This new evidence may also contribute to  the societal debate regarding the advantages and disadvantages of focusing on share-  holder value versus stakeholder value by highlighting the implications of each for firms’  strategic renewal.  Overall, our results illustrate that top managers’ Anglo-Saxon corporate governance  orientation is positively related to the extent to which they pursue exploitative and  external-growth strategic renewal trajectories. This implies that the Rhine corporate  governance orientation is positively related to the extent to which top managers pursue  exploratory and internal-growth strategic renewal trajectories. These findings provide  complementary empirical evidence to the upper-echelon perspective (Hambrick and  Mason, 1984), particularly to the understanding of the dynamic impact of top manage-  ment teams and their corporate governance orientations on a firm’s strategic renewal  over time. These findings are also relevant for the organizational ambidexterity literature  in which longitudinal research of ‘sequential ambidexterity’ (Raisch et al., 2009) is still  under-researched. In sum, regarding research implications, our study shows that top  managers’ corporate governance orientation appears to be an important antecedent  of strategic renewal and of organizational ambidexterity, both of which influence  corporate longevity.  Limitations and Future Research  Our study has several limitations, suggesting an agenda for future research. First, as our  study focuses on a single-firm context, care should be taken about generalizing our  findings. In this sense, a potential issue for future research is to incorporate varying  industry contexts for a further understanding of the influence of top management team  corporate governance orientation on strategic renewal (Filatotchev, 2007). As Malerba  (2004, 2005) and Teece et al. (1997) propound that a strategic path depends on a specific  industry in which it takes place, studying the industry context may prove useful. It is  possible that due to differences among industries regarding resources such as managers,  knowledge, and technology (Malerba, 2004, 2005), the effect of top managers’ corporate  governance orientation on how firms in different industries conduct strategic renewal  may differ. For instance, science-intensive industries (e.g. pharmaceuticals) that require  a lot of high risk capital for research and development may encourage exploratory  strategic renewal actions even when the top management teams have an Anglo-Saxon  corporate governance orientation. It should also be noted that typically top managers in  these sectors have functional backgrounds that make them more sensitive to new  technology development and advancement.  Second, our analysis of the strategic renewal actions of a firm focuses on the mana-  gerial intentionality perspective (Hutzschenreuter et al., 2007; Volberda and Lewin,  2003). It will be useful in future research to investigate the interaction between contextual  factors from the external environment and internal firm strategies (Pettigrew, 1987).  Such an approach will contribute to the understanding of ‘the effectiveness of corporate  Z. Kwee et al.1008  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  governance practices in terms of alignment of organizations with a more contextual-  ized view of organizational environments’ (Filatotchev, 2007, p. 1056). Taking a  co-evolutionary perspective would also be interesting. For instance, it may be interesting  to investigate how higher exploration ratios in strategic renewal, indicating a higher level  of absorptive capacity, enable a firm’s proactiveness to cope with environmental change  (Van Den Bosch et al., 1999).  Third, our focus is on top managers. Future research may investigate the impact of  other management levels, i.e. middle-level and operational-level managers, on strategic  renewal actions, particularly regarding exploitation and exploration (Mom et al., 2007).  It may also be interesting to study how managers across hierarchical levels deal with  strategic role conflict in managing strategic renewal trajectories (Floyd and Lane, 2000).  Fourth, our study was limited by a lack of data to take into account the size of strategic  renewal actions. As in other recent research based on content analysis (e.g. Uotila et al.,  2009), we assume that each strategic action has the same weight (Flier et al., 2003;  Volberda et al., 2001b). Finally, more longitudinal research is needed (Helfat, 2000;  Kieser, 1994). By combining a historical analysis of a long-lived firm with theory-driven  constructs, such as strategic renewal and exploitation/exploration in this paper, new and  interesting long-term developments and relationships between these constructs became  accessible for further investigation, such as the impact of alternating TMT’s corporate  governance orientation on a firm’s strategic renewal trajectories. In this way, historical  analysis in management research is important for informing theory development  (O’Sullivan and Graham, 2010).  To conclude, drawing on an extensive body of historical data from Royal Dutch Shell  plc, we have provided both qualitative and quantitative empirical evidence that top  managers’ corporate governance orientation plays an important role in guiding a firm’s  strategic renewal trajectories. This role appears to be an important organizational  antecedent that needs to be embedded in the study of strategic renewal.

APPENDIX: KEY CODING RULES  1. Exploratory strategic renewal actions are actions such as starting up new business,  launching new products/services, entering new technology fields, and entering  new markets/geographic regions; these actions are associated among others with  search, variation, and risk-taking (March, 1991). Exploitative strategic renewal  TMT and Strategic Renewal 1009  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  actions are actions such as improving existing product quality, expanding existing  markets, improving existing competencies, and reducing operational costs, e.g.  closure, consolidation, downscoping; these actions are associated among others  with refinement and efficiency (March, 1991). See also Cao et al. (in press), Flier  et al. (2003), He and Wong (2004), Lubatkin et al. (2006), Uotila et al. (2009), and  Volberda et al. (2001b).  2. External-growth strategic renewal actions include mergers, acquisitions, and joint  ventures; internal-growth strategic renewal actions are actions such as initiating  internal corporate venturing, launching new products or new services, and closing  product lines or offices (Capron and Mitchell, 2009; Flier et al., 2003; Galunic  and Eisenhardt, 1996).  3. Accept and code a strategic renewal action only if it is explicitly mentioned that  the action is materialized or implemented in the year under review; otherwise do  not code it.  4. Deciding on dates: look for the date of implementation. If not available, look  for the date of agreement/signing of contract in the annual report. Check other  sources for triangulation.  5. Actions that do not relate to strategic renewal, but that are part of daily operations  (e.g. extension of production capacity), are not considered as strategic renewal  actions and should thus not be coded.  6. Strategic renewal actions that are complementary should be coded as a single  action, e.g. the establishment of a research consortium/joint venture and the  subsequent start of production are coded as one strategic action.  7. Strategic projects started up in a joint venture, production-sharing agreement,  research consortia, strategic alliances are coded as external-growth strategic  actions.  8. Strategic renewal actions taken by subsidiary companies in which the parent has  majority control (more than or equal to 50%), are considered as actions of the  parent and should be coded. Actions of minority holdings (less than 50%) are not  coded.  9. Pure financial actions such as bonds and warrants issues are not coded as strategic  renewal actions.  10. Joint ventures that are established for the purpose of experimenting with new  technologies or operating in new markets should be coded as exploration. If it is  not clear for what purpose a joint venture is established, it should be coded as  exploitation.  11. Drilling a new oilfield in a new unexploited country is coded as exploration, each  additional oilfield in that same country is considered as exploitation.  12. Acquisitions of interests/territories are coded as external strategic actions since  they imply participation of parties outside Shell.  REFERENCES  Agarwal, R. and Helfat, C. E.

Incidence of disability by sector of industry:   An explanation   By Frans A. J. van den Bosch   and Carel Petersen   Assistant Professors. Faculty of Economics, Erasmus University Rottedam, The Netherlands.   Introduction   The increasing number of disability awards is a widespread cause for   concern. In a number of countries, among them the Netherlands, this esca-   lation has led in recent years to a sharp increase in disability benefit costs.'   At the same time there is stagnation in economic development. To what   extent can the growth in the number of disabled persons be accounted for by   the deteriorating economic situation?   Research at a macro level has indicated that a relationship exists between   the deteriorating situation of the labour market, which finds expression in   increasing unemployment, and the sharp increase in the disability incidence   rate, i.e. the number of disability awards per annum as a percentage of the   total number of insured persons (hereafter referred to as the disability inci-   dence rate).*   The question being studied here is: which factors are responsible at a   meso level (sectors of industry) for the variation in the annual number of   disability awards in the private sector? In order to gain some insight into the   matter, an analysis was made of the disability incidence rate by sector of   industry for the period 1968 to 1979. Table 1 shows that for 1968 various   sectors of industry showed considerable variation in the disability incidence   rate and that, moreover, there was a sharp divergence in increases in the   period 1968 to 1979.   The problem is approached by posing two questions. Firstly, which fac-   tors explain the considerable differences in the disability incidence rate   between the different sectors of industry in 1968? Secondly, to which factors   can be attributed the widely diverging development of the disability inci-   dence rate in the various sectors of industry in the period 1968 to 1979?   TKe legal structure   The structure of the Dutch disability insurance system will first be   described briefly.'   In the event of illness or accidents, workers in the private sector are   granted a sickness benefit on the basis of the Sickness Benefit Act for a 196   Table 1.

Three sectors of industry which do   meet this criterion have not been taken into a m u n t  in view of the very specific group of insured persons in   these sectors which would complicate comparison with other sectors of industry.   (b) The over-all disability percentage, i.e. the total number of disability beneficiaries. irrespective of year of   award, expressed as a percentage of the total number of insured, increased from 5.3 per cent in 1968 to 13.

If the disability in the performance of one's work   persists longer than one year, and also exists with regard to other "appropri-   ate" work, irrespective of the cause of disability the worker is granted a   benefit on the basis of the Disability Security Act (DSA), which came into   being in mid-1967. Depending on the degree of disability, the maximum   benefit amounts to 80 per cent of the last wage earned.   The minimum degree of disability required is only 15 per cent. There is   no maximum duration of the benefit. In addition, when determining the   amount of the benefit, no account is taken of the length of time a person has   worked. The benefit is terminated either in the case of death, or when the   worker attains the age of 65, or on recovery.   Workers in the public sector (government and non-profit making organ-   isations) are insured under a separate disability benefit system. If a worker in   the public sector is unable to work on account of illness, his salary continues   to be paid by his employer. Only when it has been established that the   disability is permanent does the worker retire ; he then receives a disability   benefit from the General Public Pension Fund. The criteria for establishing   the amount of the benefit are the same as those adhered to in the private   sector.   The influence of the economic situation   The following factors make it possible that the deteriorating economic   situation exerts an influence on the ability to obtain a disability benefit in the   private sector. 197   In the first place, the minimum required degree of disability to become   eligible for a benefit is 15 per cent; this is very low. In view of the fairly well   established relationship between increasing age and deterioration in health,   older workers are especially likely to meet this criterion. In the second place,   the lessened chance of finding work as a consequence of a disability is also   taken into account when determining the degree of disability on which the   amount of the benefit is based. In combination with the deteriorating econ-   omic situation, this has meant that approximately 84 per cent of disabled   persons receive a benefit which is equivalent to 80 per cent of the last wage   earned. Consequently, in the Netherlands many persons who are entitled to   a benefit for maximum disability are in fact quite likely to be in possession   of a considerable capacity for work4   This implies that the development of the number of disabled persons is   to some degree influenced by economic factors.   The degree to which these factors exert an influence by sector of industry   will be analysed in this article. To this end, a disability incidence rate model   is presented below. On the basis of this model an analysis is then made of the   factors which can explain the diverging levels of disability incidence rates in   1968, the first year of the period being studied. An explanation is then sought   for the differences in the increase in the disability incidence rate by sector of   industry in the period 1968 to 1979. Finally, a summary and conclusions are   presented.   The disability incidence rate model   In the literature, the importance of economic factors, often brought into   play by an unfavourable labour market situation (unemployment) or a   deterioration in capital returns in industry, has already been stressed as an   explanation for the number of disability awards5 However, in addition to the   influence of these factors, the model which we have designed also contains   non-economic factors. For instance, it seems obvious that variables such as   state of health and type of work performed will affect the likelihood of dis-   ability, independently of the influence of economic factors.   DR = f (H, PH, 0, E, LS, S)   where DR = disability incidence rate, H = state of health, PH = perceived   health, 0 = type of work, E = economic factors, LS = legal structure, and S   = distribution according to sex. The following comments will serve to eluci-   date the model.   The dependent variable is the disability incidence rate (DR). A   deteriorating state of health (H) of the insured population will result in an   increase in the disability incidence rate. Data relating to state of health are   scarce. Often, however, the mortality rate is employed as an objective indi-   cator of state of health.   The second independent variable is perception of health (PH). By this is   understood the pattern of norms and values, which is subject to change, and   concerns the personal and social definition of health. This concept is difficult   The specification of the model is as follows:   I98   to operationalise. However, a concept of illness, which under the influence of   social trends is expanded increasingly to recognise as illness psychological   impairments in addition to physical handicaps, will exert a positive influence   on the disability incidence rate. It would appear reasonable to assume that   the altered perception of health is an over-all social phenomenon and that   this trend does not differ significantly by sector of industry.   The third independent variable (0) has been included to show the   influence of type of work on the disability incidence rate. Since some jobs are   more demanding physically (e.g. in the construction sector) or psychologi-   cally than other jobs, the importance of this factor should definitely be recog-   nised.   The economic factors (E) represent the influence of the labour market   situation (unemployment) and depending on this, the employer’s assessment   of the profit and loss resulting from the employment of a worker. In view of   downward wage rigidity, in those sectors of industry where profits show signs   of deterioration, employers will be inclined to shed the least productive   workers (among whom are mostly older workers with or without a handi-   cap).6 In view of the possibilities offered by the DSA, as explained in the   introduction, the deterioration of the labour market and of the economic   situation consequently exert a positive influence on the disability incidence   rate.   The legal structure (LS), (especially the criteria for granting disability   awards and the factors which determine the amount of these awards), is also   a determining factor in the explanation of the disability incidence rate by   sector of industry although the same legal structure applies in all sectors of   industry. Besides, since the disability incidence rate for men, corrected for   age, is on average lower than for women, a correction for distribution accord-   ing to sex (S) should be made by sector of industry.   The variables discussed above represent the most important determi-   nants of the disability incidence rate according to sector of industry.   Disability by sector of industry in 1968   The disability incidence rate model serves as a frame of reference when   analysing the factors accounting for the considerable differences in the dis-   ability incidence rates between sectors of industry in 1968. We shall analyse   the extent to which the variables which explain the disability incidence rate   by sector of industry have exerted an equal or a diverging degree of influence.   Factors which exert the same degree of influence on the disability incidence   rate cannot be held responsible for differences in disability incidence rate by   sector of industry. For this reason, we shall first take a closer look at this group   of factors.   As we remarked earlier, it seems reasonable to assume that the variables   of perceived health (PH) and legal structure (LS) exert an equal influence on   the disability incidence rate in all sectors of industry.   Analysis of the state of health (H) focuses on the average age of insured   persons by sector of industry. With increasing age, health deteriorates and the 199   Table 2.

For instance, in 1979 the number   of disability awards per 100 insured persons for all persons insured under the   DSA in the age groups 20-24 and 60-64 was 0.9 and 9.5 respectively. In   addition, in view of the increasing risk of death which accompanies increas-   ing years, age has been chosen as a proxy for (somatic) state of health.’   Elimination of differences in distribution according to sex and age by sector   of industry has been achieved by standardisation of the disability incidence   rates. It was found that, taking the period as a whole, on average the disability   incidence rates standardised for age and sex did not differ significantly from   the non-standardised disability incidence rates. From this may be drawn the I   important conclusion that state of health (H) and distribution according to   sex (S) do not provide an explanation for the differences in disability inci-   dence rates by sector of industry in the period under study.R   However, it would seem reasonable to assume that the influence of the   variable (0). which represents the type of work or occupation, can vary   according to sector of industry. In the absence of a more reliable indicator,   the disability incidence rate as a consequence of occupational accidents and   occupational diseases has been employed to test this assumption. Table 2   (column 2) shows that this indicator does vary according to sector of industry,   but makes no significant contribution to the explanation of the differences in   disability incidence rates.   The final independent variable is the influence of economic factors (E)   on the disability incidence rate. In table 2, developments in employment and   the unemployment rate by sector of industry have been employed as proxies   for economic factors. It  has been assumed that a declining share of profits in   net output, declining employment and an increasing unemployment rate are   proxy variables for a deteriorating economic situation which, other things   being equal, exerts a positive influence on the disability incidence rate.9   Table 2 shows that the highest disability incidence rate is found in the   construction sector where the economic situation has deteriorated by com- 200   parison with developments as a whole. Banks and insurance companies as   well as the retail trade and the crafts industry show the lowest disability   incidence rate, a circumstance which may be explained by favourable econ-   omic developments. The relationship between the development of econ-   omic factors (here developments in employment and the unemployment   rate) and the disability incidence rate is thus clear.   Summarising, it may be concluded that on the basis of the model the   differences in disability incidence rates in 1968 can be explained by the differ-   ences in types of work, but especially by diverging economic developments   in the years prior to 1968.   Development of the number of disability awards by sector   of industry during the period 1968 to 1979   In this section we shall deal with the diverging development presented   by disability incidence rates by sector of industry. For the sake of brevity, in   table 3 only those sectors of industry have been included in which the abso-   lute increase in the disability incidence rate varies sigtllficantly from the   average increase. The categories of food, beverages and tobacco as well as the   metal and electrical industry show the largest absolute increase, while the   category banks and insurance companies shows the smallest absolute   increase. In order to explain these striking differences, we shall examine the   extent to which the influence of the independent variables on the disability   incidence rate has altered during the period 1968-1979.   As explained above, the disability incidence rate corrected for age and   sex by sector of industry does not differ significantly from noncorrected   disability incidence rates in the period under study. On the basis of this   finding, we conclude that state of health (H) and sex distribution (S) do not   furnish an explanation for the diverging increases of disability incidence   rates.   Table 3.

Source; As in table 1, plus data provided by the Central Planning Office, The Hague.   cornparues 0.6 136 103   by the DSA 0.9 114 40   20 1   This finding also applies with respect to the variables type of work (0)   and legal structure (LS). We have assumed that the influence of type of work   on disability incidence rates is constant Consequently, this variable provides   no explanation for the diverging increasesto Moreover, the legal structure   regarding criteria for the granting of disability awards and determination of   the amount of the award has in essence remained unchanged.ll   The remaining independent variables are thus: influence of economic   factors (E), which may differ according to the sector of industry, and the   altered perception of health, which is assumed to exert an equal influence on   the disability incidence rate in all sectors of industry. The influence of econ-   omic factors is clear from table 3. Both sectors of industry which show the   greatest increase in disability incidence rates are characterised by a sharp   decline in the share of profits in net output and, coupled with this, a clear   decline in employment. I *    By contrast with macroeconomic developments, the sector of industry   with the smallest increase retained high profits, while employment has   expanded considerably.   Earlier studies would appear to indicate that the increase in the disability   incidence rate in the public sector can only be explained by the vanable   perception of health.!) By contrast with the private sector, it is assumed that   in the public sector economic factors exert no influence on the disability   incidence rate. This is plausible, since in the public sector profit-making is not   a goal, and consequently it is difficult to assess the costs of labour as against   monetary yield.   Since the altered perception of health is an over-all social phenomenon,   this variable exerts an equal influence on the disability incidence rate in both   private and public sectors. From this it follows that the increase in the dis-   ability incidence rate in the public sector from 0.5 per cent in 1968 to 1.1 per   cent in 1979 (+O.6%), is a proxy variable for the influence of the altered   perception of health on the disability incidence rate in various sectors of   industry.   On the basis of this assumption, it may be concluded that the increase   in the disability incidence rate by sector of industry consists of two com-   ponents. The first of these is an increase in all sectors of industry of approxi-   mately 0.6 per cent as a consequence of the altered perception of health   (PH). The second component is the influence of economic factors (E) which   varies considerably by sector of industry, so that the net increase in the   disability incidence rate by sector of industry shows wide variations." For   instance, the influence of economic factors on the disability incidence rate   of banks and insurance companies was nil in the period under review. On   the other hand, deteriorating economic developments have exerted a   strongly positive influence on the disability incidence rates of the other two   sectors of industry mentioned in table 3.   202   Summary and conclusions   In this article, with the aid of a disability incidence rate model, we have   analysed which factors can explain the diverging development trends in dis-   ability awards per 100 insured persons (the disability incidence rate) by   sector of industry in the Netherlands in the period 1968 to 1979. It has been   established that differences in state of health by sector of industry cannot   provide a suitable explanation. Neither can an explanation be found in the   legal criteria for determining awards, which have not basically altered in the   period under review. It has, however, been found that differences in the   disability incidence rates in 1968 may be attributed to differences in type of   work between the sectors of industry, as well as to the influence of diverging   trends of economic development in the various sectors of industry in the   period prior to 1968.   The diverging pattern of increase in disability incidence rates in the   period 1968 to 1979 can be explained by an altered perception of health   which leads to an over-all increase in all sectors of industry, as well as by   the influence of economic developments which vary according to the sector   of industry, and which finds expression in the share of profits in net output   and in employment. The conclusion may thus also be drawn that the   growth in the number of disabled persons may to a large degree be   attributed to the deteriorating economic situation.   Consequently, the success of a policy aimed at applying a brake to the   rapid growth in the number of disabled persons is dependent on economic   developments to a great extent.

Management Innovation and Leadership:  The Moderating Role of Organizational Sizejoms_976 28..51  Ignacio G. Vaccaro, Justin J. P. Jansen,  Frans A. J. Van Den Bosch and Henk W. Volberda  Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University  abstract Recent research on management innovation, i.e. new managerial processes,  practices, or structures that change the nature of managerial work, suggests it can be an  important source of competitive advantage. In this study, we focus on management innovation  at the organization level and investigate the role of leadership behaviour as a key antecedent.  Due to its prominent role within organizations, top management has the ability to greatly  influence management innovation. In particular, we focus on leadership behaviour and  examine transformational and transactional leadership. Additionally, as contextual variables  like organizational size may influence the impact of leadership, we investigate its moderating  role. Findings show that both leadership behaviours contribute to management innovation.  Interestingly, our study indicates that smaller, less complex, organizations benefit more from  transactional leadership in realizing management innovation. On the other hand, larger  organizations need to draw on transformational leaders to compensate for their complexity  and allow management innovation to flourish.  Keywords: innovation, management innovation, organizational size, transactional leadership,  transformational leadership  INTRODUCTION  As competition intensifies and the pace of technological change accelerates, firms need  to renew themselves. The challenge is not only offering new products and services, but  also changing the nature of management within organizations. This can take place by,  for instance, adapting organizational structures, processes, and practices to generate a  valuable source of competitive advantage (Teece, 2007). Early studies such as Chandler  (1962) and, more recently, Mol and Birkinshaw (2008) clearly show how management  innovation may not only change an organization and bring potential benefits to it, but  also redefine an industry by influencing the spread of new ideas.

Birkinshaw et al. (2008, p. 829) define management innovation as  ‘the generation and implementation of a management practice, process, structure, or  technique that is new to the state of the art and is intended to further organizational  goals’. Accordingly, in this definition ‘newness’ is related to management innovation at  large, in other words, new to the world. Well known examples of management innova-  tion are lean production (introduced by Toyota) and brand management (developed by  Procter & Gamble) (Mol and Birkinshaw, 2008).  Given its importance for organizational performance (Birkinshaw and Mol, 2006;  Hamel, 2006), surprisingly little research has gone into explaining antecedents of man-  agement innovation. Management innovation entails an encompassing and complex  kind of change to the way in which management work is performed. For instance,  management innovations typically emerge without a dedicated infrastructure (such  as research labs – which aid technical innovation), and are relatively abstract and  intangible, which makes them potentially complex and ambiguous (Birkinshaw et al.,  2008). This underscores the relevant role of individuals within the organization, or as  Birkinshaw et al. (2008) put it, ‘the critical role of human agency’ (p. 826), which makes  the role of leadership especially relevant to management innovation.  This study contributes to the emergent dialogue on management innovation in at least  two ways. First, we investigate management innovation at the organizational level of  analysis by focusing on the pursuit of management innovation that is new to the firm, and  investigate CEO leadership behaviour as a key antecedent of management innovation.  This resonates with the rational perspective on management innovation (Birkinshaw  et al., 2008) which sees the actions of key individuals, such as leaders, as a crucial factor  driving the pursuit of management innovation. Scholars have proposed that leadership  can effectively stimulate innovative thinking (Zhou and George, 2003), and have shown  that it significantly impacts organizational choice (Finkelstein, 1992). Because manage-  ment innovation represents a rather encompassing change in the way management work  is performed, we see leadership as a preeminent issue in understanding how organiza-  tions introduce such a (potentially) complex type of innovation. In this study we draw on  the distinction between transformational and transactional leadership (Bass, 1985) and  uncover how each type of leadership behaviour affects the pursuit of management  innovation in organizations. Hence, this study deepens our understanding of the role  of human agency by studying how different leadership styles influence the pursuit of  management innovation within organizations.  Second, we investigate whether the role of human agency is related to organizational  complexity. For this, we consider the moderating role of organizational size. Prior studies  such as Nahavandi and Malekzadeh (1993) and Koene et al. (2002) have suggested  that the impact of leadership behaviour may decrease as organizational size increases.  Leaders in larger organizations may encounter more difficulty in initiating change in the  way management work is performed due to more complex organizational contexts and  increased spatial separation. In addition, increased bureaucratic formalization within  larger organizations may have a neutralizing effect on the impact of direct leadership  behaviour (Koene et al., 2002). Building on previous studies which asserted that the  Management Innovation and Leadership 29  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  impact of leadership behaviour is dependent on organizational size, we study different  types of leadership behaviour in relation to both larger, more complex organizations as  well as smaller, arguably simpler, ones.  This paper is organized as follows. In the next section we present a review of the  relevant literature and develop our hypotheses. Subsequently, we present the findings  obtained from the empirical analysis carried out using a sample of organizations span-  ning different industries. We conclude with a discussion of our findings, implications,  limitations, and issues for further research.  LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESES  Management Innovation: Definition and Level of Analysis  Management innovation has been defined as the ‘generation and implementation of a  management practice, process, structure or technique that is new to the state of the art  and is intended to further organizational goals’ (Birkinshaw et al., 2008, p. 829). It  addresses changes in what managers do and how they do it (Hamel, 2006), which have  been argued to be very ambiguous and hard to replicate, hence more likely to lead to  sustainable competitive advantage and increased competitiveness (Birkinshaw and Mol,  2006; Hamel, 2007; Teece, 2007). Management innovation, then, relates to changes in  how managers set directions, make decisions, coordinate activities, and motivate people  (Hamel, 2006). These changes become part of the organization as management inno-  vation manifests itself through new management practices, processes, or structures.  In describing management innovation, Birkinshaw et al. (2008) identify four different  perspectives on management innovation: institutional, fashion, cultural, and rational  perspective. In line with Birkinshaw et al. (2008), our treatment of management inno-  vation throughout this paper remains close to the rational perspective. This perspective  assumes that new practices, processes, or structures are deliberately introduced by key  individuals within organizations in order to improve the organization’s performance.  Birkinshaw et al. (2008) reflect upon ‘two equally valid points of view’ (p. 828) regard-  ing the novelty of management innovation, namely, ‘new to the state of the art’ and ‘new  to the organization’. In the first instance, ‘new to the state of the art’ or new to the world,  the level of analysis is management at large, or indeed the world, as this definition implies  no known precedents. In the case of ‘new to the organization’, the level of analysis is the  firm. Focusing on this level of analysis enables us to empirically test a series of hypotheses  at the firm level of analysis and draw on a potentially much more sizable sample of  management innovations. While the development of management innovation that is new  to the world involves a greater degree of uncertainty, the introduction of management  innovation that is new to the firm is not without uncertainty. Firms, for instance, may be  able to draw on the practices that have previously been implemented elsewhere, but the  success of new practices may also depend on their adaptation to their idiosyncratic  context within the organization in which they are introduced (Ansari et al., 2010).  While a requirement for innovation, change in itself does not constitute management  innovation (West and Farr, 1990). For instance, downsizing may bring about change  to an organization, but is not related to management innovation if it represents a  I. G. Vaccaro et al.30  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  unchanged continuation of managerial work. For management innovation to occur, the  implemented change should include novelty in the way the organization is managed by  means of new practices, processes, or structures, including their associated techniques.  An example of management innovation is self-managed teams, which involves the intro-  duction of teams responsible for their own internal functioning, setting of priorities, and  decision making within an organization (Bunderson and Boumgarden, 2010). The imple-  mentation of self-managed teams at Procter & Gamble (Lawler, 1990; Waterman, 1994)  exemplifies change in three facets of management innovation, i.e. practices, processes,  and structures. Management practices refers to what managers do as part of their job on  a day-to-day basis – setting objectives and associated procedures, arranging tasks and  functions, developing talent, and meeting different demands from stakeholders, for  example (Birkinshaw et al., 2008; Mol and Birkinshaw, 2009). The introduction of  self-managed teams at Procter & Gamble changed the work of managers as employees  became in charge of setting their own goals and deciding when and how tasks were going  to be performed. Management processes refers to the routines that govern the work of  managers, drawing from abstract ideas and turning them into actionable tools, which  typically include strategic planning, project management, and performance assessment  among others (Birkinshaw et al., 2008; Hamel, 2006, 2007). Following the introduction  of self-managed teams at Procter & Gamble, reward and promotion systems were  overhauled. Pay was determined in relation to skill, which in turn served as the basis  for promotion, as evaluated by fellow team members. Organizational structure, that is, how  organizations arrange communication, and align and harness effort from their members  (Birkinshaw et al., 2008; Hamel, 2007), was also altered at Procter & Gamble as hierar-  chical layers were removed following the adoption of self-managed teams.  Leadership and Management Innovation  Following Birkinshaw et al.’s (2008) focus on the role of human agency in management  innovation, we centre on the specific actions from individuals inside the organization by  focusing on leaders and associated behaviours. Due to their prominent role within  organizations, leaders affect organizational conditions under which management inno-  vation may be generated and implemented (Crossan and Apaydin, 2010; Hambrick and  Mason, 1984). Management innovation may not necessarily be developed by the CEO  or other executives within the top management team, however their role may be  instrumental in creating an organizational context conducive to experimentation with  and introduction of new processes, practices, or structures. For instance, leaders have  been shown to impact organizational outcomes such as performance (Haleblian and  Finkelstein, 1993) and choice (Finkelstein, 1992). Various studies have considered lead-  ership as one of the organizational attributes underlying change and innovation (cf.  Chandler, 1962; Kanter, 1984; Peters and Waterman, 1984). Elenkov et al. (2005)  described alternative ways in which leaders can influence innovation within the organi-  zation by means of their prominent position. Similarly, leaders may also impact man-  agement innovation by reducing uncertainty and complexity associated with its pursuit  (Birkinshaw et al., 2008) by communicating a shared vision, supporting change, and  developing a certain type of organizational culture. For instance, Marion and Uhl-Bien  Management Innovation and Leadership 31  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  (2001) suggest that leaders may have a significant role in simplifying complex dynamics  within organizations. That is, leaders may be able to help subordinates make sense of the  changes, and provide guidance and support when changes may seem ambiguous.  Birkinshaw et al. (2008) point to ‘internal change agents’ as key individuals driving  management innovation which underscores the critical role of human agency in the  deliberate pursuit of management innovation. These key individuals within organiza-  tions are instrumental in identifying new trends in the environment and needs within the  organization for which management innovation may be desirable. They would also be  particularly important in supporting initiatives related to changing practices, processes,  or structures. By virtue of their position CEOs, and their associated type of leadership  behaviour, relate to this type of key individual. This has not gone unnoticed by either  academic or managerial authors, who have presented CEOs as key change agents within  the organizations they lead. An example of this is Lars Kolind who led the introduction  of the ‘spaghetti’ organization at Oticon, a Danish hearing aid manufacturer (Foss, 2003;  Larsen, 2002). This management innovation involved organizing around project teams  as opposed to departments, which led to a very flat organization which consisted of only  two layers: the CEO and ten other managers were the management team, while all other  employees were organized into projects. Kolind’s leadership was in many ways crucial  in the pursuit of this management innovation. He understood where the company was  and what the environment demanded, and articulated a compelling vision of where  Oticon should go. Moreover, he committed to personal development, responsibility, and  freedom among employees in order to foster intrinsic motivation. This resulted in a very  dynamic environment within Oticon in which employees were part of different projects,  and projects competed for resources in a market-like environment within the organiza-  tion (Foss, 2003).  The role of leadership has also been found to be relevant in employee willingness to  voice ideas aimed at improving the organization and the way in which it functions  (Detert and Burris, 2007). To address how specific leadership behaviours affect the  pursuit of new management practices, processes, or structures, we focus on transforma-  tional and transactional leadership. Drawing on the work of Burns (1978) and Bass (1985)  on leadership behaviours, transformational and transactional leadership have featured in  various studies in order to capture the extent to which leaders engage their subordinates  by instilling in them the organization’s goals, or clarifying the rewards that will follow  from the attainment of such goals (Rubin et al., 2005; Yammarino et al., 1997, 1998).  Building on this and other literatures on the topic (Atwater and Bass, 1994; Bass, 1990;  Howell and Avolio, 1993; Podsakoff et al., 2006), we develop hypotheses about how  transformational and transactional leadership influence management innovation.  Transformational leadership. Transformational leadership is aimed at the followers’ identi-  fication with its purpose and common goals. It stimulates employees to attain to organi-  zational goals by appealing to high-level needs for self-actualization (Bass, 1985; Burns,  1978; Lindebaum and Cartwright, 2010). Transformational leadership consists of four  dimensions: (1) idealized influence; (2) inspirational motivation; (3) intellectual stimula-  tion; and (4) individual consideration (Avolio et al., 1999). Idealized influence represents  the degree to which leaders are admired, respected, and trusted. This dimension includes  I. G. Vaccaro et al.32  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  charismatic behaviour that causes followers to identify with the leader and fosters a sense  of intrinsic motivation to achieve goals. Inspirational motivation provides meaning and  challenge to their followers, fostering team spirit and encouraging them to envision  attractive future states. Intellectual stimulation prompts followers to question assumptions  and be creative. Transformational leaders ensure that creativity and innovation is part of  the problem solving processes. Individualized consideration includes the extent to which  followers’ potential is developed by attending to their individual needs, as well as creating  learning opportunities and a supportive environment for growth (Bass et al., 2003).  Through idealized influence, transformational leaders may stimulate management  innovation by sharing the risk of innovative actions with followers (Bass et al., 2003),  thereby enabling and empowering followers to challenge existing management pro-  cesses, practices, or structures (Bass, 1994). Such leaders may also contribute to reducing  complexity by getting others to rally around them in the pursuit of management inno-  vation (Marion and Uhl-Bien, 2001), underscoring their credentials as change agents.  Through inspirational motivation, transformational leaders emphasize the relevance of  looking for new ways of doing things and encouraging synergies by working together  (Sosik, 1997), also giving the task a meaning and followers the challenge to thrive (Bass  et al., 2003). Inspirational motivation contributes towards followers’ intrinsic motivation,  a powerful drive to search for creative ways of addressing changes in managerial  processes, practices, or structures (Amabile, 1996, 1998).  Through intellectual stimulation, transformational leaders encourage followers to  question the effectiveness of the organization’s current management practices (Sosik,  1997). Transformational leaders show high expectations and confidence in followers’  ability to deliver progressive solutions rather than merely appropriate ones (Bass, 1994;  Jung et al., 2003), strengthening the stimuli for innovative thinking in the way work is  approached or structures set up. In this sense, intellectual stimulation challenges current  work practices and encourages followers to consider different angles as they perform  their jobs (Hunt, 1991). In so doing, it also serves the purpose of challenging followers by,  for instance, assigning them to the tasks they are best suited for according to their skills,  and encourages followers to look for creative solutions (Amabile, 1998). By means of  individualized consideration, transformational leaders are expected to display apprecia-  tion for each of the followers and their ideas (Sosik, 1997). Individualized consideration  also fosters attention and distributed participation in changing management practices  and processes (Bass, 1994) by letting followers know that their work matters and is valued  by organizational leaders (Amabile, 1998). Hence, we argue that transformational  leadership contributes to the advancement of novel managerial processes, practices, or  organizational structures.  Transformational leadership behaviour can affect all three facets of management  innovation, i.e. management practices, processes, and structures. Interviews carried out  at Royal DSM, a Dutch life sciences and material sciences company, provide anecdotal  evidence concerning the link between transformational leadership behaviour and the  management practices, processes, and structures. During the adoption of self-managed  teams at Royal DSM, transformational leadership behaviour from top management  stimulated changes in practices by giving teams of operators the freedom to take on roles  other than those included in their job descriptions. By removing the position of team  Management Innovation and Leadership 33  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  supervisor, senior management reinforced the teams’ ability to make their own decisions.  This intellectual challenge resulted in teams orchestrating their work differently. Simi-  larly, processes associated with the management of projects saw changes in the way they  were organized as teams were now expected to decide how projects were to be carried  out. Meanwhile, the organizational structure of the plant was altered by the removal of  the team supervisor layer, yet teams could draw on a clear vision from senior manage-  ment to align their efforts with the company’s objectives.  Hypothesis 1: Transformational leadership will be positively related to management  innovation within an organization.  Transactional leadership. Transactional leaders engage in a transaction in order to satisfy  their respective wants (Burns, 1978), and provide extrinsic motivation to their subordi-  nates. Transactional leaders are primarily concerned with gaining compliance from  subordinates – which they will do by targeting their self interest – by agreeing upon the  conditions and rewards that will follow the fulfilment of certain requirements (Bass,  1990; Bass and Avolio, 1993; Yammarino and Bass, 1990).  The role of transactional leaders has also been argued to be closely related to the  reinforcement and refinement of institutionalized learning (Vera and Crossan, 2004),  which suggests that this type of leadership behaviour may be conducive to the pursuit of  management innovation as it may contribute to reducing organizational complexity  (Damanpour, 1996) and ambiguity through setting clear goals and rewards that under-  pin underlying changes in processes, practices, or structures.  Transactional leadership consists of two dimensions: contingent reward and active  management by exception (Den Hartog et al., 1997). Contingent reward entails the  clarification and specification of what is expected of organizational members and the  assessment of goals and subsequent reward for its accomplishment. Through contingent  reward, leaders build commitment to the fulfilment of ‘contracts’ with followers (Avolio  et al., 1999; Bass and Avolio, 1993). While the establishment of such contracts has been  argued to hamper creativity and result in less initiatives to address new ways of facing  work (Amabile, 1996, 1998), we maintain that the impact of contingent reward on  management innovation can be positive (Elenkov and Manev, 2005). This may be the  case through, for instance, an increased sense of fairness and justice in the workplace in  which unmet standards and objectives do not go unnoticed, while success is dutifully  rewarded (Podsakoff et al., 2006; Walumbwa et al., 2008). Furthermore, active manage-  ment by exception, on the other hand, involves the leader’s active involvement and  intervention to monitor and rectify any divergence from an agreed standard in the  follower’s work. Such involvement underscores the way in which change agents, i.e.  leaders, can drive the process of management innovation within the organization.  The introduction of self-managed teams at Royal DSM also illustrates how transactional  leadership affects management practices, processes, and structures. New management  practices, such as the loose definition of tasks and functions for individual team members,  were assessed against clear key performance indicators established by senior management.  Processes associated with themanagement of projects were run by self-managed teams, with  senior management stepping in to intervene when key performance indicators seemed  I. G. Vaccaro et al.34  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  compromised. Some of these key performance indicators were set at the team level, which  ultimately affected the compensation structure of team members. Placing reward and  accountability at the team level, and changes in the organizational structure such as orga-  nizing the plant round self-managed teams, prompt teams to seek for better decision-making  in order to meet their goals. In doing so, teams began establishing new communication lines  with other teams, as well as with different internal stakeholders, such as technical and  maintenance staff, in order to look for new ways of improving efficiency.  Hypothesis 2: Transactional leadership will be positively related to management  innovation within an organization.  Leadership and Management Innovation: The Moderating Role of  Organizational Size  Prior studies have argued that the effectiveness of leadership behaviour depends on  contextual conditions, such as the stage of organizational growth, top management team  homogeneity (Alexiev et al., 2010; Nahavandi and Malekzadeh, 1993), organizational  climate (Shalley and Gilson, 2004), and mode of governance (Egri and Herman, 2000;  Pawar and Eastman, 1997). We focus on organizational size as contextual variable, as  size has been considered to capture the scope of operations differentiation and increased  bureaucratic complexity (Pawar and Eastman, 1997). Previous studies have offered  conflicting evidence regarding larger, more complex, organizations and innovation.  Some have suggested that larger organizations may be better suited to pursue innovation  (e.g. Baldridge and Burnham, 1975), yet evidence of the opposite has also been put  forward (e.g. Blau and McKinley, 1979). We argue that organizational size is a key  contextual variable in the study of management innovation as it relates to the underlying  added complexity of pursuing management innovation in organizations of different sizes.  The effectiveness of leadership has long been argued to be dependent on organiza-  tional size (Hambrick, 1989; Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Mintzberg, 1973). Nahavandi  and Malekzadeh (1993) propose that the impact of leaders decreases in larger organiza-  tions. Similarly, Koene et al. (2002) find that in smaller organizations, leadership has a  stronger impact than in larger ones. While direct and regular contact between leaders  and followers may suffice to set goals and effectively influence members’ behaviour while  organizations are small, as organizational size increases leaders may find it increasingly  hard to achieve the desired level of commitment (Atwater and Bass, 1994). First, the  complexity of communication increases in larger organizations and the difficulty of  members’ ability to express their opinions may diminish the effect of the leader’s impact  (Bantel and Jackson, 1989; Bass, 1994). In addition, scholars have studied the notion of  receptivity, which refers to how receptive members of an organization are to processes of  change (Hunt, 1991), and can vary according to the contextual factors such as organi-  zational size (Koene et al., 2002; Pawar and Eastman, 1997). Pawar and Eastman (1997)  argue that, while simple organizational structures will be more receptive to transforma-  tional leadership, larger, more specialized, and complex organizations will prove less  receptive. Accordingly, we expect organizational size to influence the effectiveness of  transformational and transactional leadership in the pursuit of management innovation.  Management Innovation and Leadership 35  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  Transformational leadership and organizational size. Previous studies have argued that organi-  zational size plays an important role in how receptive members of an organization  will be to transformational leadership behaviour (Egri and Herman, 2000; Pawar and  Eastman, 1997; Yang et al., 2010). For instance, Egri and Herman (2000, p. 596)  conclude that ‘. . . smaller . . . organizations were more likely to have organizational  structures . . . that were highly receptive to transformational leadership’. In smaller orga-  nizations transformational leaders are expected to reach and interact more frequently  with followers, thereby increasing the level of commitment to management innovation  even more (Atwater and Bass, 1994). With regard to inspirational motivation, we expect  transformational leaders to be better able to convey their vision and arise individual and  team spirit to generate management innovation in smaller organizations. Berson et al.  (2001), for instance, reported that the content of the vision conveyed by the leader is  affected by organizational size. In their study, the authors propose that inspiring follow-  ers in larger organizations may be particularly challenging for the efficiency of leaders, as  ‘larger organizations are likely to be composed of a broader range of interests that a  leader may need to take into consideration when formulating a vision’ (Berson et al.,  2001, p. 68). In this way, conveying an unambiguous message becomes more difficult in  larger organizations. Similarly, we expect intellectual stimulation to be weaker in larger  organizations where transformational leaders may encounter difficulties in encouraging  followers to challenge the status quo and foster changes in management practices and  processes (Hunt, 1991; Pawar and Eastman, 1997). Finally, we expect transformational  leaders in larger organizations to be less able to provide followers with individual  consideration, thus displaying less appreciation for their ideas and creativity ( Jung et al.,  2003; Sosik, 1997), than in smaller organizations.  Hypothesis 3: Organizational size moderates the relationship between transformational  leadership and management innovation such that increased organizational size  weakens the positive effect of transformational leadership upon management  innovation.  Transactional leadership and organizational size. Similarly, we expect transactional leaders’  influence to be stronger in smaller organizations where transactions can be efficiently  established, monitored, and assessed. As organizational size increases, the direct impact  of transactional leadership and its receptivity may diffuse due to increased complexity  and difficulties to reach all members of the organization (Atwater and Bass, 1994; Hunt,  1991). The proliferation of formal structures and procedures in large organizations  changes the context in which leadership is exercised (Hunt, 1991). As mentioned earlier,  this type of leadership centres upon the completion of ‘contracts’ between leaders and  followers (Bass and Avolio, 1993). The larger an organization becomes, the more ‘con-  tracts’ (and associated control mechanisms) it needs in order to operate. This could give  rise to several levels of bureaucracy in which divergence from known management  processes, practices, structures, or techniques is discouraged. Hence, we expect transac-  tional leaders in small organizations to be better able to efficiently monitor their follow-  ers’ performance and be able to reward or reprimand such performance accordingly.  Similarly, we expect management by exemption to be most efficient in small organiza-  I. G. Vaccaro et al.36  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  tions where transactional leaders would be able to monitor and timely correct deviances  from managerial processes, practices, structures, or techniques.  Hypothesis 4: Organizational size moderates the relationship between transactional  leadership and management innovation such that increased organizational size  weakens the positive effect of transactional leadership upon management innovation.  METHODS  Research Setting and Data Collection  We drew a random sample of 1000 Dutch firms from the REACH database, which  contains corporate information of all companies registered at the Chamber of Com-  merce in the Netherlands. The sample covered a broad range of industries and was  restricted to privately held firms with at least 25 employees. In 2006, we administered a  survey to one (non-CEO) respondent within the top management team (TMT) of each  organization. We addressed members of the TMT based on the information available  in our database. In line with upper echelons literature, due to the level at which they  operate we expected respondents at this level to be well informed about changes in  management practices, processes, and structures. Members of the TMT were also well  equipped to rate their CEO’s leadership style since, as direct reports, their relationship  and interaction with the CEO would be more regular. Targeting members of the TMT  also relates to the role of human agency in management innovation, particularly internal  change agents, as they will be key in driving, championing, and pursuing changes in  practices, processes, and structures (Birkinshaw et al., 2008). Because of this, we believe  these respondents were well suited to be part of our study and sufficiently knowledgeable  to provide adequate responses. Respondents were ensured confidentiality and offered a  summary of the results. Following the initial mailing of surveys, a second copy was sent  after a month, and follow-up calls were made two months after the first mailing. TMT  members from 151 companies returned usable questionnaires, corresponding to a 15.1  per cent response rate in our measurement sample. The respondents had an average  company tenure of 7.78 years (S.D. = 3.10), and the average size of the companies  measured in full-time employees was 103.46 (S.D. = 5.14). The firms were operating in  a wide range of industries: manufacturing 51.6 per cent, construction 20.5 per cent,  services 8.6 per cent, and others 19.3 per cent. To test for non-response bias, we  examined differences between respondents and non-respondents. T-tests showed no  significant difference based on the number of full-time employees. Additionally, we  compared early and late respondents in terms of demographic characteristics and model  variables. These comparisons did not reveal any significant differences (p < 0.05). Aside  from the risk of differences that there may be between respondents and non-respondents  in our dependent and independent variables, the data indicates no problems related to  non-response bias.  Assessment of common method bias. We took several steps to reduce the risk of this bias. These  steps spanned the design and administration of the survey, as well as statistical controls  Management Innovation and Leadership 37  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  after the questionnaires were returned. During the design and administration of the  survey we explicitly assured respondent confidentiality, which serves the purpose of  reducing common method bias by making respondents less likely to modify their answers  due to social desirability or how they think others may expect them to answer. In  addition, we improved the scale items by using them in interviews with industry repre-  sentatives of a rank similar to that of respondents in this study (i.e. members of the TMT).  This helped us to use clear grammar and keep the survey concise.  Having received the questionnaires we performed several statistical analyses. First, we  carried out Harman’s one-factor test using the items included in our model. Should  common method bias be present, we would expect a single factor to be extracted and  account for most of the variance in the variables included in our study (Podsakoff and  Organ, 1986). Following our analysis we did not obtain such a single factor. Second, we  controlled for the effect of a single unmeasured latent method factor (Podsakoff et al.,  2003), a test used in numerous studies which employ single respondents. In this test, a  confirmatory factor analysis model is constructed such that all items are allowed to load  on their theoretical factors (theoretical model), and another in which they are also  allowed to load on a latent common factor. A comparison between the models is used to  assess the presence of common method bias. While a comparison between our theoreti-  cal model (c2 = 1208.09, d.f. = 492) and the model with the additional latent common  factor (c2 = 1020, d.f. = 459) indicates a better fit in the latter, less parsimonious model  (Dc2 = 187.75, D d.f. = 33, p < 0.001), the latent common factor accounted for a very  small portion (4.0 per cent) of the total variance compared with management innovation,  which accounted for 36.6 per cent of the variance explained. Taken together, the results  of our tests suggest that common method bias is not a pervasive problem in this study.  Measures and Validation of Constructs  Dependent variable. As a scale of management innovation at the organizational level is not  yet available, the following steps were taken to develop a new measure for this construct.  First, we reviewed relevant literatures on management innovation (Birkinshaw and Mol,  2006; Hamel, 2006; Kimberly, 1981; Mol and Birkinshaw, 2006) and generated a pool  of items to tap into the different facets of management innovation (i.e. management  practices, processes, or structures). From this pool of items, unique items were selected to  be included in the initial survey. During subsequent interviews, various industry repre-  sentatives were invited to suggest improvements to the survey items. Finally, the phrasing  of the items was further enhanced by the authors and peers, a process that resulted in a  final version of the measurement.  The resulting six-item measure for management innovation (a = 0.76) reflects the  manifestation of management innovation in new practices, processes, and structures.  Items 1 and 2 (management practices) tap into changes in what managers do as part of  their job in the organization, which includes setting new rules and associated procedures.  This may also result from the assignment of work to someone (i.e. task) and the duty to  perform such piece of work (i.e. function). Items 3 and 4 (management processes) relate  to how work is performed and include changes articulated in routines that govern the  work of people as well as how compensation is set up. This may be illustrated by changes  I. G. Vaccaro et al.38  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  in management systems or changes in what is expected of people, which outcomes and  behaviour are rewarded and which are not, which relate to the way people are com-  pensated. Items 5 and 6 (structures) tap into the way in which organizations arrange  communication, align and harness their members’ efforts, which provides the context in  which work is performed. These items relate to changes in communication structure as  a sign of different ways of doing things, for instance by allowing different constituencies  to exchange information. Additionally, the formal structure of the organization could be  changed to bring about changes in communication, autonomy, and discretion. Overall,  our scale of management innovation reflects all three facets of management innovation,  focusing on what managers do, how they do it, as well as the organizational context in  which work is performed. An overview of the items used in this scale is provided in the  Appendix.  As opposed to measuring changes that belong to a particular example of management  innovation, we purposely chose to focus on new practices, processes, and structures  for two reasons. First, to tap into a larger pool of management innovations which may  have been labelled, e.g. a group of practices and processes developed at Toyota that has  been labelled ‘Lean Manufacturing’, or not. Second, to avoid problems associated with  different interpretations and delimitations of what constitutes a certain management  innovation. Lean Manufacturing, for instance, is described by Mol and Birkinshaw  (2008) as one of the top 50 management innovations since the industrial revolution, and  spans production, supply chain, design, and engineering (Karlsson and Åhlström, 1996;  Womack et al., 1990). It also includes other innovative practices, processes, and struc-  tures such as kanban (which is crucial for just-in-time systems), and the organization of  suppliers into functional tiers, which may affect, for instance, product development and  supply chain management.  In order to establish construct validity for our measure, we assessed the reliability and  validity of our measure of management innovation using a separate sample collected  through a survey administered in 2008. We obtained a random sample of 3,000 Dutch  firms from the REACH database and mailed questionnaires to a TMT member (non-  CEO) within each organization. From this sample, 863 surveys were returned, for a  response rate of 28.86 per cent. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) among the items  included in our scale of management innovation yielded a one-factor solution with an  eigenvalue of 3.25 and item loadings above 0.65, indicating evidence of convergent  validity in our measure. In order to test the discriminant validity of our measure we  included a four-item scale of innovativeness (adapted from Bell, 2005) which captured  the extent to which companies actively seek to be ahead of their competitors in imple-  menting new and innovative processes in their operation or releasing new products or  services into their markets. This measure of innovativeness was positively associated  (r = 0.29; p < 0.01) with our scale of management innovation. We first tested a Confir-  matory factor analysis (CFA) model in which each measurement item was constrained to  load on the scales they were associated with, i.e. management innovation and innova-  tiveness. The overall results showed acceptable fit (c2 = 315.72, d.f. = 34, GFI = 0.93,  CFI = 0.93, RMSEA = 0.098). All items loaded significantly (p < 0.01) on their res-  pective scales, providing evidence of convergent validity (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988).  We also computed an alternative one-factor CFA model which showed poorer fit  Management Innovation and Leadership 39  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  (c2 = 1,644.67, d.f. = 35, GFI = 0.64, CFI = 0.58, RMSEA = 0.231), showing evidence of  discriminant validity (Bagozzi and Phillips, 1982).  Independent and moderating variables. Transformational leadership was assessed by a senior team  member response to items of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ-5X; Bass  and Avolio, 1995). Respondents rated the items on transformational leadership for his or  her executive director on a 7-point scale with 1 = ‘strongly disagree’ and 7 = ‘strongly  agree’. The four dimensions of transformational leadership consist of five items for  idealized influence, inspirational motivation, and intellectual stimulation, and four items  for individualized consideration. Because the dimensions are highly correlated (average  r = 0.75; p < 0.01) and past research has shown that the dimensions of transformational  leadership failed to exhibit discriminant validity in predicting outcomes, we averaged  the items to create a single index for transformational leadership (a = 0.94). Similar to  previous studies (Bono and Judge, 2003; Jung et al., 2003), we conducted subsequent  analyses using the composite index. Transactional leadership was measured with eight items  from the MLQ (Bass and Avolio, 1995). Following previous practice (e.g. Ensley et al.,  2006; Epitropaki and Martin, 2005; Lowe et al., 1996; Waldman et al., 2001) we used  the four-item scale of contingent reward and the four-item scale for active management  by exception to measure transactional leadership. We averaged the items to create a  composite index for transactional leadership (a = 0.70). To account for the moderating  effect of organizational size, we included the logarithm of the number of full-time employ-  ees (adapted from secondary sources) in our analysis.  Control variables. In order to account for potential alternative explanations, we included  several control variables. Following studies in which it is suggested that the age of senior  managers within organizations affects the extent to which such organizations engage in  change and innovation (Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Wiersema and Bantel, 1992), we  included in our model the logarithm of the CEO age. Previous studies have also suggested  CEO tenure to be negatively related to experimentation and change (Finkelstein and  Hambrick, 1990). In view of this we included in our analysis the logarithm of the number  of years the CEO had been active within the organization. Because top management team  size can affect the diversity and variety of the TMT (Siegel and Hambrick, 2005), we  included in our analysis the logarithm of the number of TMT members. Finally, to  account for potential industry-specific effects, we included four dummy variables for com-  panies active in manufacturing, construction, service, and other sectors.  ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  Table I presents the descriptive statistics and correlations between the study variables.  Table II shows the results of the regression analyses with management innovation as the  dependent variable. Four models were specified in this analysis (see Table II). The first  one (model 1) includes only the control variables. Subsequently the two leadership  constructs were introduced (model 2), then the moderating variable (model 3), and  lastly the interaction terms were added (models 4). To reduce the potential for multicol-  linearity, we followed Aiken and West (1991), and mean-centred the individual variables  I. G.

Finally, we computed variance inflation  factors (VIF) to further assess whether multicollinearity was a concern in our sample. All  values were well below the cut-off value of 10 (Netter et al., 1990), indicating no risk of  multicollinearity.  The results show that our hypothesized positive relationship between transformational  leadership and management innovation (Hypothesis 1) was supported (b = 0.30;  p < 0.01). Hypothesis 2, in which we proposed a positive relationship between transac-  tional leadership and management innovation, was also supported (b = 0.25; p < 0.05).  In addition to these direct effects, we also hypothesized that the relationship between  leadership behaviours and management innovation would be less pronounced in larger  organizations. Although we found organizational size to have a moderating role upon  the relationship between transformational leadership and management innovation, it did  not support our hypothesized relationship (Hypothesis 3). In fact, we found that the  effectiveness of transformational leadership increases with organizational size (b = 0.28;  p < 0.05). To plot this interaction, transformational leadership and organizational size  took the values of one standard deviation below (i.e. low level) and above (i.e. high level)  their respected means. The plot of this interaction (Figure 1) shows a positive effect of  transformational leadership on management innovation in large organizations. More-  over, it also reveals that transformational leadership hardly affects the pursuit of man-  agement innovation in small organizations.

By applying management innovation to the organizational level of analysis, and focusing  on transformational and transactional leadership behaviours, this study reflects top  management’s impact on management innovation (Birkinshaw and Mol, 2006;  Birkinshaw et al., 2008). Our study contributes to new insights regarding the relative  influence of transformational and transactional leadership behaviours on management  innovation. Moreover, we show that the effectiveness of these leadership behaviours is  dependent upon organizational size. In this sense, as proposed by Hambrick and Mason  (1984) and Finkelstein (1992), we find that leaders are important internal actors within  organizations, and the kind of internal change agents (Birkinshaw et al., 2008) who  impact the implementation of new practices, processes, and structures. In addition to  Elenkov and Manev (2005), who provided evidence showing that leadership explained  top management’s influence on both product and organizational innovation, we provide  evidence of the direct association of transformational and transactional leadership  on management innovation, including the moderating effect of organizational size. Our  study also departs from others which, having centred on technical innovation, focus  solely on the positive association with transformational leadership (Howell and Higgins,  1990), or find transactional leadership to be negatively related (Lee et al., 2003). Our  findings reflect the role of human agency in the pursuit of management innovation as  they relate to the actions of key individuals within the organization who may initiate and  drive changes in practices, processes, or structures (Birkinshaw et al., 2008).  Our research findings provide evidence that transformational leadership contributes  to management innovation. Transformational leaders who inspire team success and  develop trusting and respecting relationships based on common goals enable organiza-  tions to pursue changes in management practices, processes, or structures. They consider  organizational members individually and generate greater predisposition to experiment  with changing organizational tasks, functions, and procedures. Moreover, they may even  promote organizational members to rethink existing structures and task specialization,  and reconsider new ways for the organization to ‘get things done’. Their leadership may  also be conducive to making sense of an otherwise ambiguous type of innovation where  goals and outcomes may not be as clear as in the case of, for instance, the development  of a new product through technical innovation. With this prominent role of transforma-  tional leaders, our study contributes to prior studies relating transformational leadership  to performance (Koene et al., 2002; Waldman et al., 2001), creativity (Mumford et al.,  2002), and technical innovation (Jung et al., 2003). We go beyond these previous findings  by providing evidence that transformational leadership is conducive to pursuing man-  agement innovation.  Although prior studies (e.g. Lee et al., 2003) have suggested that transactional lead-  ership may reduce the ability of organizational members to suggest new ways for  management and facilitate efforts for changing management practices (Amabile, 1998;  Lee, 2008), our study shows that transactional leaders do contribute to lowering potential  barriers associated with management innovation. This suggests, in line with Vera and  I. G. Vaccaro et al.44  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  Crossan (2004), that transactional leadership may be helpful in the implementation  phase of management innovation – inducing organizational members to attempt to meet  targets not only by means of tried and trusted management methods, but also by setting  targets and rewarding organizational members contingent upon the attainment of goals  associated with management innovation. In this sense, management innovation may be  generated and directed from the upper-echelon in organizations while the implementa-  tion of certain management innovations may be monitored and rewarded accordingly to  pre-established goals. Alternatively, the relationship between transactional leadership  and management innovation may also be mediated by trust, which may help employees  cope with the potential uncertainty and complexity of new processes, practices, or  structures. As Avolio et al. (1999) suggested, contingent reward may be the basis through  which expectations by both leaders and followers evolve, and trust is generated as parties  honour their ‘contracts’ over time. The more ‘contracts’ are fulfilled over time, the more  organizational members are rewarded and the more transactional leaders may display  trust in their followers’ ambition to generate and implement management innovations.  In this sense, trust mediates the relationship between transactional leadership and  management innovation as trust may be translated into increased ‘freedom’ to diverge  from current management and engage in management innovation. Future research is  necessary to understand the emergence and implementation of management innovations  within organizations and uncover the relationship of leadership behaviour, trust, and  management innovation.  Regarding the potential moderating role of organizational size on the association  between transformational and transactional leadership and management innovation,  our study contributes to prior studies concerning the importance of incorporating  organizational contingencies when studying leadership attributes (i.e. Pawar and  Eastman, 1997; Shalley and Gilson, 2004). By influencing the complexity of commu-  nication structures and lowering the potential receptivity of organizational members,  our study argued that organizational size would decrease the effectiveness of transfor-  mational and transactional leadership. Surprisingly, however, we found that transfor-  mational leadership becomes more important for generating and implementing  management innovation in larger organizations. A potential explanation for this is  that in large organizations transformational leadership may mitigate the negative  impact of increased hierarchies and bureaucracies on members who may fail to make  sense of their role within the organization’s complex system of goals (Sarros et al.,  2002). Transformational leadership may complement an organization’s increasing  rigidity and bureaucracy by maintaining a sense of meaningfulness in members of  the organization, which may be more conducive to management innovation. An alter-  native explanation is that transformational leadership can cascade from upper echelons  through lower echelons such that in large organizations the message and intended  effect of transformational leaders can be observed throughout the organization as a  result of repetition of patterns across the different management layers (Bass et al.,  1987; Waldman and Yammarino, 1999). In this way transformational leaders may be  able to exercise not only direct leadership among those in contact with them, but also  distant leadership as their message cascades down the different management layers  (Vera and Crossan, 2004).  Management Innovation and Leadership 45  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  Our study reveals that transactional leadership is more important in smaller organi-  zations when they want to pursue management innovation. In smaller organizations  ‘contracts’ may be more easily established and monitored, which may presuppose less  room for divergence from the managerial status quo (Bass, 1985). However, this may also  lead to repeated face-to-face interaction between transactional leaders and organiza-  tional members, which can lead to increased trust between the parties and extra effort  in their work (Ehrlich et al., 1990; Shamir, 1995). These arguments could help to explain  why under transactional leadership organizational members find the flexibility to  introduce changes conducive to management innovation. Our findings can also be  interpreted in light of different phases in the life of organizations. While organizations are  small, they may be under greater pressure to achieve short term goals, which would  emphasize transactions required by management (which offers a reward) from followers  (who offer their work). As organizations become larger, leaders may become more  transformational in order to instil in members of the organization that sense of urgency  to deliver.  Overall, our findings reflect Birkinshaw et al.’s (2008) rational perspective on man-  agement innovation, while underscoring the role of human agency. The role of leaders  in the pursuit of management innovation is relevant through both transactional and  transformational leadership behaviours, though this behaviour needs to be adapted  according to the complexity of the organization, operationalized in this paper as  organizational size.  This first effort towards operationalizing management innovation at the firm level and  uncovering the role of leadership is constrained by at least three limitations, which also  represent fertile ground for future research in this area. First, in this paper we have begun  to investigate how leadership can affect management innovation. Building on this, a  broader perspective may provide interesting avenues for further research. Multilevel  research into the interaction between firms, industry, and external environment may be  useful in order to better understand how management innovation is adopted and diffused  within and across industries, as well as the influence that is exerted by external factors  upon firms (Dijksterhuis et al., 1999). Past research in the financial sector ( Jansen et al.,  2006) has looked at the effects of environmental dynamism and competitiveness upon  innovation. Insights of this kind could contribute to investigating how environmental  characteristics influence the relationship between leadership behaviour and manage-  ment innovation.  Second, in measuring management innovation at the organizational level we con-  structed a new scale. While we took steps to assess the validity and reliability of our  measure, other studies may seek to enhance this measurement and test its viability by  applying it to different datasets. Moreover, the data we used were cross-sectional. Further  longitudinal research could contribute to this area by empirically testing the causal  relationships established in our model. Additionally, we relied on one member of the  TMT per organization who may have responded based on aspirations of change rather  than change itself. Multilevel analysis combining the view from the TMT with that of  other levels may contribute to our understanding of management innovation. Finally, we  have not investigated the impact of management innovation on organizational perfor-  mance. Therefore, future research could also focus on the outcomes of management  I. G. Vaccaro et al.46  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  innovation. Management innovation has been explicitly defined as intended to further  the organization’s goals (Mol and Birkinshaw, 2006), and called upon in order to  overcome adverse performance (Volberda and Bosch, 2005). An increased understand-  ing of how and to what extent management innovation can add to an organization’s  performance is not only appealing for research, but necessary if this concept is to  gain acceptance as a key instrument to improve competitive advantage in the corporate  world.  Through this study we have contributed to the emerging literature on management  innovation in several ways. We have introduced a complementary construct of manage-  ment innovation that spans processes, practices, or structures that are new at the level  of analysis of the organization. Additionally, we have introduced a new scale at the  organizational level for this management innovation construct. Lastly, we have studied  the influence of human agency, that is, the role of two types of leadership behaviour and  their impact upon management innovation, as well as the moderating effect of organi-  zational size. Concluding, our paper illustrates the role of human agency in the pursuit  of management innovation by studying both transformational and transactional leader-  ship. While both types of leadership behaviour are relevant for management innovation,  smaller, less complex, organizations benefit more from transactional leadership while  larger organizations need to draw on transformational leaders to compensate for their  complexity and allow management innovation to flourish.

This   represents a great challenge when there are no   obvious external threats, and no obvious reasons for   having a concerted action. Floris Maljers, Charles   Baden-Fuller and Frans van den Bosch explore the   inherent tensions which exist between stability and   change. Change is necessary to maintain success,   but too much change is disastrous. The authors   argue that there are several possible solutions to   this paradox, including that of generating periods of   intense activity followed by periods of comparative   stability and incremental improvement. Using the   introspection of one of the CEOs of Unilever, who   held office from 1984 to 1994, the authors examine   how these tensions were played out and resolved.   Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd   Introduction   In this article we wish to examine the CEO's task of   leading the large complex multinational organisation   strategically. The basis for our analysis is a combination   of introspection from one of the CEOs of Unilever and an   appreciation of the contribution of past strategy research.   Unilever is a company which employs more than 280,000   people in more than 80 countries, and is high on   Fortune's 500 list (see Exhibit 1). It has been fortunate in   having a sustained record of profitability for more than a   decade, reflecting a combination of good fortune and   hard work from all its management and workforce.   Our article touches on only one key issue, that of how to   maintain momentum when there are no obvious crises   and threats. As many others have pointed out, a clear   internal crisis is an excellent rigger for action. The   enemy need not be within, it can be without, and   environmental change can be a powerful motivator.   Hannibal ante Portas rnobilised the Romans two thousand   years ago. More recently, the success of Asian com-   panies has mobilised American and European industries.   When an organisation is seriously lagging, the challenge   is clear, it must move forward. There are possibilities of   mobilisation from an external threat, even where there is   no profits crisis. This has been most evident among firms   which have experienced deregulation. In the UK, British   Telecom, British Gas, and the water utilities, among   others, have been undergoing major change in the face   of real or threatened entry and new regulatory regimes.   We are concerned with the different, and arguably more   difficult, problem, that of maintaining success when there   are no obvious threats, internally or externally. Cyert   and March have argued that the successful organisation   has both the financial and human resources to undertake   the investments needed to maintain success; in their   words, there is 'slack'. Slack resources, although elpful,   are not sufficient. The spur for action must also be   present, and it requires something special to enlist the   support of many layers of management when there is no   obvious crisis, no clear enemy, and no compelling reason   why the company should change dramatically. Unilever   has been lucky in being able to rise to such occasions,   not just once, but repeatedly.   In this article we examine the role of the chief executive   (in our case three people) as leaders and stimulators of   repeated changes. As Exhibit 1 shows, the changing   membership of the CEO team has been evolutionary   rather than revolutionary, especially when one appre-   ciates the equality of the triumvirate. Yet, as we suggest   below, the CEO team appears to have been a critical part   of the change process.   European Management Journal Vo114 No 6 December 1996 5 5 5   MAINTAINING STRATEGIC MOMENTUM: THE CEO'S AGENDA   Exhibit  1   Sketch of Uni lever    In 1995, net after tax, Unilever had a turnover of $49 billion, and a net profit of $2.3 billion before special items, giving a   margin of nearly five per cent. It had four product divisions: three of which were in fast moving consumer goods-food,   detergents, and personal care products. The fourth division was speciality chemicals. It employed 280,000 people, and   had manufacturing operations in more than 80 countries. It was in the top 40 of the Fortune 500 by turnover and   profitabil ity.   It has an unusual governance structure. It does not use the continental system of a supervisory board, nor does it have a   division of chairperson and chief executive. Rather it has several CEOs, usually three men. The table below shows how   changes in the CEO structure have been evolutionary rather than revolutionary. One CEO is chairman of the Dutch   holding company, one is chairman of the British company, and there is usually a 'third man' who is equal to the other   two.

Tabaksblat M. Perry   1995 M. Tabaksblat M. Perry N. Fitzgerald   In any large organisation, the chief executive team has to   be subtle yet firm in its use of power. Too many   upheavals provoke chaos, too few may invite paralysis   and decline. Getting the balance right is difficult and   there are many ways to achieve this end. In Unilever,   during the last decade or so, there have been periods of   sharp upheaval followed by periods of comparative   stability. During the upheavals, the strategy has been   reassessed and a new direction forged. In the intervening   years, the new strategy was bedded own by means of   acquisitions and disposals, new investments, and the   building of skills in people and ideas. The concept of   oscillation is a key theme.   We will try to illustrate these points in the following   pages. However, we must first explain why we think the   environment has been benign to Unilever as a whole in   the last decade, and why it has been true that mobilising   the corporate body has involved more careful   preparation and effort. This is not to say that in   particular business units there have been no dangers nor   even crises. But a crisis in a small part of the overall   corporation is not a crisis for the whole.   Unilever and its Environment   In the early 1980s, according to many, Unilever's   performance was satisfactory, but rather unexciting. As a   group, it formulated a strategy which had clear   geographic ambitions maintaining its traditional, mostly   European, base, and expanding mainly in the North   American continent. The geographic strategy was   evident in a major US acquisition made in 1978. The   purchase of the National Starch and Chemicals Company   did not just add a geographic dimension, it also added a   new product group to Unilever's chemical's business.   With the benefit of hindsight, the acquisition revealed   that Unilever was less explicit about its product portfolio   strategy. At that time, the portfolio was considerably   more diverse than it is now. It included the United   African Company, a trading company with a strong   presence in West Africa, with a proud and profitable   history. There were also large remnants of the vertical   integration policies of the past such as carton making,   printing and packaging, oil milling, advertising agencies,   a market research group and a fast growing transport   division.   At this time there was a weak threat to the group;   organisations which were not performing well could be   taken over. The RJR-Nabisco deal proved this threat was   real in the food industry a few years later. However, it   would be hard to argue, even with the benefit of   hindsight, hat this was a mobilising factor for change. In   the early part of the 1980s, Unilever was profitable and   cash rich. The concept of the conglomerate was still   fashionable during this period. The messages of the   556 European Management JournalVo114 No 6 December 1996   MAINTAINING STRATEGIC MOMENTUM: THE CEO'S AGENDA   gurus of the day were that if you had good management,   you could manage virtually anything and everything.   Yet, despite the absence of threats, Unilever underwent a   major change programme in 1984, which involved   reshaping the enterprise's product portfolio to a slimmer,   more focused core, and disposing of some 20 per cent of   the company.   In the late 1980s, the general environment was more   turbulent and hostile. This hostility was muted for   Unilever, where the core of foods and personal care   products was not suffering the same kinds of   competition as car manufacturing plants, chemicals or   high technology companies. More significantly, because   by this time the group as a whole had a more focused   look, having concentrated its portfolio into four product   divisions, and because it had sold many 'peripheral' but   often profitable businesses, the threat of takeover was   even weaker than before. Yet, in 1988 Unilever went   about another major change, that of refocusing even   more sharply its product portfolio following on from the   efforts of 1984.   In the early 1990s, the environment was different again.   Here the turbulence was one equally balanced between   opportunity and threat. The threat came from slow   growth rates and changes in consumer spending patterns   in the major domestic markets in Europe and North   America. The opportunities were in the development of   emerging markets in the former bloc of Eastern Europe,   and the high rates of growth in the Asian arena. These   opportunities uggested, but did not require, major   adjustments. Once again, there was no obvious enemy,   but even so Unilever took the opportunity to adjust its   geographic strategy in 1992, and these changes are still   being driven through.   In conclusion, over the last ten years, Unilever has faced   no obvious crisis, yet it has initiated at the group level   three major change initiatives or waves of change. To   outsiders, it has been trying to ride the waves of   environmental change forces, attempting to shape its   environment by choices of where and how to compete.   Of course, it has not always been wholly successful in   this unstated aim, but even the ability to attempt to do   this differentiates it from many other organisations   which have operated in a mainly reactive mode.   These observations beg as many questions as they   answer. For example, how did the strategy waves get   formed and carried out? Was there any evidence of   cumulative building between the waves? And, can we   learn from the Unilever experience? It is to these issues   we now turn.    Mobilising the Organisation in 1983   As said earlier, in the mid-seventies, the company had   formulated a strategy which had clear geographical   ambitions, mainly strengthening the position in North   America, but much less explicit in stating the objectives   for the product portfolio. The activities were grouped in   product coordinations, which usually reported irectly to   a member of the Parent Board. The absence of product   priorities meant that the rate of growth of a group   depended to a large extent on the energy and creativity   of the responsible director and his team. Or, to put it   another way, there was a large bottom-up element in the   way in which the activities proliferated. For the sake of   completeness, we add that growth was seen as a   corporate necessity.   What were the triggers which persuaded the CEO group   that the strategy was inadequate, and that it would be   necessary toadd a product dimension to the geography?   One strong argument for a review was certainly that the   peripheral groups, as we will call them for the sake of   convenience, in many cases showed isappointing profit   performance, usually well below the 'orthodox' Unilever   core groups. In addition, there was generally an uneasy   feeling at the top that the understanding of the   periphery was rather limited. The amount of time and   effort required to control and give guidance to these   businesses was more than their size and complexity   necessitated. Or, to put it differently, the Head Office   costs which their existence generated, was seen as   disproportional to their profit contribution.   But these were not the only factors. There were also   some triggers caused by capital requests. For example,   one of the more successful parts of the transport group   was a company called the Norfolk Line, which   specialised in 'roll-on roll-off' transport between the   UK and Continental Europe. In 1983, the management of   this company felt it needed to invest a large sum in   Chatham, England, to improve its facilities. The director   responsible agreed, and the proposal was brought o the   CEO group of three. In the discussion it became   increasingly clear that there was no-one else in Unilever   with sufficient expertise to evaluate the proposal of this   subsidiary. In a group where large investment decisions   are taken with great care and where a high degree of   expertise ispresent in many fields, this created an uneasy   feeling to the extent hat the question was raised: 'what   are we doing in transport anyway?' Looking back, it was   like throwing a crystal in under-cooled water, suddenly   the doubts about many of the peripheral activities   solidified, and that was the starting point for a complete   review of Unilever's trategic position. In due course,   this resulted in a complete reformulation f the Unilever   strategy, adding a clear and well defined product   dimension to the geographic objectives. This became   known as the 'core' strategy because it identified four   core product groups: foods, detergents, personal   products and chemicals.   How were these groups identified? The principle was   that the top team wanted to concentrate onproducts and   markets where Unilever had most expertise in   technology, marketing, sales and customer service. Or,   to put it in the words of the military strategist Clauswitz,   the top decided to concentrate on those areas where the   European Management JournalVo114 No 6 December 1996 557   MAINTAINING STRATEGIC MOMENTUM: THE CEO'S AGENDA   company could set the rules, rather than those where it   had to follow them. It is necessary to emphasise that at   this time, in 1984, the product groups were selected in   very broad terms only. Despite this obvious limitation,   the move was seen to be a considerable improvement on   Unilever's past, and it formed the start of later   definitions of product priorities. It is also worth pointing   out this idea of forming a core product strategy was   rather under-developed among European companies.   Now we all know that formulating strategy is easy; as   the German military commander von Moltke observed   in the war of 1870, everybody with common sense can   do it. It is far more difficult to implement he new   strategy, certainly in a company the size of Unilever. It   was clear that the new strategy would have major   consequences for those managers who were not working   in the newly defined core groups. As was Unilever's   tradition, the first step was to communicate the new   strategy to as many members of the management as   possible, and obtain their support. Because this was done   with great care, it turned out to be less difficult than   expected. It was helped by the fact that Unilever has   always had a good communications system, which had a   number of facets. For important corporate decisions,   there was (and still is) a tradition that the top 100 to I20   and twenty most senior people are involved. This takes   the form of a meeting where proposals of the CEO are   freely discussed in working groups and a plenary   session. To the surprise of the CEO group, the special   meeting to discuss the core-strategy ended in an   overwhelming acceptance of the new concept. This   demonstrated that many in the organisation were   waiting for some change, or as put earlier, the water   was really under-cooled, and that a large group of the   top executives were all co-owners of the new strategy.   Apart from ad hoc meetings, there was, and still is, a   regular communication flow which starts at the top.   Every year in March, the CEO team addresses a group of   400 senior executives, mostly from the operating   companies and explains the progress and plans of the   corporation, emphasising the new elements. The senior   managers who attend this event in turn have meetings in   their units and give the same basic message, adapted to   their audiences. In this way, the information cascades   quickly from the top down to the required level. In   addition, the company has a strong informal network of   contacts between managers. In 1984, the acceptance of   the new strategy was the more surprising as a number of   aspects went against the corporate tradition. Selling   companies which were part of Unilever had been done in   the past, but only rarely. The same can be said for   restructuring and cost cutting - it was certainly not   unknown - but the examples were few and far between.   The group which felt most threatened by change was   probably older middle management. The most senior   people realised the need for change, the younger people   saw it generally as an opportunity. However, the new   direction was usually, though certainly not unanimously,   well received. In addition, to many of the company's   employees it came as a shock. If one had joined Unilever,   it was considered to be a lifelong tenure, almost like   being a civil servant. Unilever was essentially a European   company, and this sense of the employment contract   was still quite common in Europe 10-15 years ago, in   contrast o North America then and Europe now.   At this point it is worth emphasising that there was at   the time no financial corporate crisis, not even an   indication that one might come. Top management were   not aware of any immediate threat of an unfriendly   takeover by a raider or financial wizard. The company   was profitable, had ample cash and a triple A credit   rating. Second, it was clear that Unilever had a   considerable amount of underpefforming assets in the   peripheral activities, probably one of the reasons for a   relatively low rating in the stock market. When it started   its disposal programme, it turned out that it could sell   some of the non-core subsidiaries for very good prices,   enabling investment in those areas Unilever knew well   and where it could achieve high returns.   Implementing the new strategy meant more than   acquiring, disposing and restructuring. It also required   a concerted effort to improve the quality of the   marketing and sales functions. There was also a need   to strengthen research and technology. Fortunately, the   speed of innovation increased notably. Company   structures became slimmer, and the number of layers in   the organisation were reduced. In short, the new   strategy brought not only a change in focus of the   company in product terms, it was accompanied by a   number of efforts to improve performance in practice.   In evaluating the results of the strategy, we must be   aware that the economy in the second half of the   eighties grew, the business cycle was in a positive phase.   However, even taking all this into account, the financial   indicators used by the outside world improved very   considerably. Not only did profitability and return on   investment improve, but the stock exchange rating of   Unilever compared to its peer group went up. Even more   importantly, the company culture began to move, and   viewed from the somewhat restrictive lens of one of the   CEOs, the management became more enterprising, less   risk averse and more creative.   The Second Change and a Move to   Greater Corporate Entrepreneurship in   1988   It took quite some time to implement the major elements   of the 1983-4 strategy. To the outsider, it is notable that   seeing the bedding down of the changes initiated in   1984 was perceived to be important and that no   comparable change programme was initiated until 1988.   By 1988, after the completion of the larger disposals and   the purchase of some sizeable and many smaller   acquisitions, the CEO group were asking themselves   again, 'is the present product portfolio as defined in 1984   .558 European Management JournalVo114 No 6 December 1996   MAINTAINING STRATEGIC MOMENTUM: THE CEO'S AGENDA   sufficient to give the company the growth it wanted?   Are we not missing out in major markets?' Or, to put it   differently, having cut off so much in the past few years,   'does the company need a new leg?' This led to a   reappraisal of the strategic position, a second phase after   the formulation of the core strategy. For this, the   company used the code name Starfish, an animal which   can grow a new leg after it has lost one.   The groundwork of collecting information and formu-   lating alternatives was undertaken by Unilever's own   small corporate development s aff with the help of an   outside consultant. It would be interesting to discuss the   role of outsiders in formulating strategies, but this is   outside the scope of this paper. We note here that the   CEO's perspective is that Unilever has used outsiders   more as extra pairs of hands than as generators of ideas.   The conclusion of this phase II study was discussed in   the Board and the outcome was, in hindsight,   surprisingly simple.   The consensus was that Unilever's four chosen areas   offered more than enough opportunities for growth. The   existing strategy was reconfirmed, but there were a few   new elements. First, the phase II discussions emphasised   the need to give new impetus to certain elements of the   earlier change and disposal programme which had not   always been implemented fully, notably where   nationalistic reasons were felt to make speedy action   undesirable. Secondly, a few small up-and-coming areas   were identified, where Unilever would invest in a   modest way to see whether it would be able to enter   those fields. But other than that, the existing activities   offered more than enough scope.   At this point it may be interesting to summarise some of   the differences between the Starfish approach and the   1984 phase described earlier. The first phase was entirely   an initiative of the CEO and was therefore basically top-   down. The CEO group had identified the problem, had   developed the basic concepts, and had proposed the new   strategy to the Board. It had also presented it to the   management in various meetings and taken a direct   interest in the implementation. This went relatively far,   certainly for a corporation as decentralised asUnilever.   An important matter was the precise interpretation of   the core concept where many emotional and rational   aspects came together. In an organisation where   consultation and consensus had always been, and still   were, considered the basic manner in decision-making,   the relatively large top-down element was not always   easily accepted. In 1988 the traditional mixture of top-   down and bottom-up was partly restored. The manage-   ment groups in the centre, who have profit respon-   sibility, were more fully involved in the process. They in   turn consulted the major operating companies in the   other countries. Or, to put it differently, top-down and   bottom-up met somewhere halfway and this made   involvement and communication easier. Having said   that, however, the process still had a major top-down   element by Unilever's normal standard.   A second ifference was that this time there was a much   more focused effort to combine a product strategy with   a geographical strategy. The teams identified Latin   America as a priority, notably Mexico and Brazil where   Unilever was virtually absent. In addition, like everyone   else, the teams pointed out the opportunities in East   Asia, especially South East Asia. Unilever was fortunate   to have some strong positions in a number of markets. In   Europe, the review concluded that it could not expect   much growth in the North, where markets were   saturated for most - though certainly not all - of the   products. However, the company were clearly under-   represented in the Mediterranean. The Berlin Wall was   still standing at the time and opportunities in Eastern   Europe were considered limited. In all, what was   achieved was a much more sophisticated strategic matrix   than it had before. To give just one example, Unilever   became more convinced that it had to expand its foods   business more aggressively in developing countries,   where it was clearly under-represented.   A third difference was that the company began to realise   that the four core areas were each composed of a number   of sub-groups, and that some of these were more   interesting for their future development than others. This   not very revolutionary observation was hard to address.   How far should one go in splitting a core group into   components? On what level does it still make strategic   sense and when would they reach the stage of empty   definitions/ To give a practical example of what the   teams did, take personal care products, which they had   treated as one group but which they now split between   mass market products, such as toothpaste and shampoo   on the one hand and prestige products on the other.   That required a clear view of the mechanism of the   markets and the behaviour of the consumer and the   retailer. Icecream was another area, where the impulse   market needs outlet control and has different economics   from the take-home product. In giving the examples, it  sounds easy, but this is an area in which the crux was in   the detail.   Communicating the outcome of the Starfish project   throughout he company was much easier than the   earlier exercise. Many managers had been involved in   the preparations and there was a generally felt need to   update the existing strategy. This was an interesting   development in corporate culture compared to phase I.   At least, from the CEO perspective, it seemed that   strategic change had become an accepted part of   corporate life and that the management welcomed   strategic direction.   Looking back, the implementation f the 1988 changes   were generally in line with expectations. A major search   for acquisition candidates in food companies in Latin   America had good results and Unilever could strengthen   its position in Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Argentina.   Another core group where it increased its investments   was detergents for industrial use, especially in Europe.   However, the main success was in personal products,   notably the prestige segment.

This made the company a major   participant in a market where so far it was hardly   represented. Would things have been different without   such a review? This is perhaps hard to say, and certainly   the CEO is likely to say that the results would not have   been as good.   Changes for a Greater Product Focus   and a New Geographic Emphasis in   1992   This brings us to phase III of the strategic process of the   last decade. It was initiated in 1991-92, about 4 years   after the Starfish project. The work on phase III was   started because many in the organisation, including the   CEO group, perceived that the business environment   had changed dramatically, and there was a need to   review the strategic priority. New geopolitics, together   with emerging innovations in production technology,   including informatica, led to the conviction that a more   explicit strategy for allocating scarce resources was   required. This desire for change came from the plethora   of opportunities, but it would be hard to call it a forced   change. Many other large organisations saw the same   environment, but did not react similarly.   We can see the forces for change if we look at the   consequences of some of the new economic groupings   such as the expanded European Union, and to a lesser   extent, NAFTA. Events had shown that existing   production structures were in a number of cases ineffi-   cient. For example, where in the past, every European   country produced a full range of icecream products for   the local market, the abolition of the last vestiges of the   internal borders opened up interesting opportunities to   improve conomies by reducing the number of locations   and increasingly specialising the production lines in the   remaining ones. This necessitated major investments in   restructuring programmes, which required ahigh level of   managerial involvement and financial commitment. It   also meant hat gradually more central guidance became   unavoidable. This was an important cultural change in an   organisation where decentralisation had been a   traditional basic organising principle.   A unique historical event, the fall of Marxism and the   (partial) acceptance of a free market economy created a  second set of opportunities. The opening up of the   markets in Central and Eastern Europe led to an almost   gold-rush struggle, when all the major international   players tried to enter countries uch as Poland, Hungary   and the Czech Republic. Similarly, the markets of the CIS   countries could not be ignored. In addition there were   opportunities in China, where the possibility of estab-   lishing Western brands and quality standards tempted   many consumer-goods companies to invest. In all these   cases, investment decisions were, to an unusual degree,   based on intuition, because the absence of reliable   information made a scientific approach impossible.   In the light of all this, it was clear that the company had   to establish priorities, notably in allocating scarce   management. It was also obvious that many decisions   had a considerable 'top-down' element, because it was   impossible to have all products introduced in every new   market, or to undertake all restructuring at the same   time. The CEO team therefore set out and agreed   strategic priorities with the full Board and took upon   itself to monitor the implementation with more than   normal care.   While changes in the environment led to a new approach   to geographical decision-making, the product strategies   were also reviewed. This meant further important   refinement of the work done in phase II. Let us illustrate   this with an example. In the past, beverages had been   identified as one of the groups which should be   emphasised within the foods division. On the basis of   a further analysis, it was decided that the company   should further concentrate on tea where it was already   world leader. Given its competitive structure, the coffee   market was not seen as a priority because the nature and   power of Unilever's competitors made the opportunities   less attractive and the risks seemingly greater. In   contrast, within tea, it was felt that large opportunities   existed, notably in promoting tea as a cold drink. This   was a successful product in the US which had been   recently introduced into Europe. This type of refinement   of focus, based on an assessment of the available   technology, and supported by a strong research and   marketing programme was seen to be key to future   Success .    In short, although there was no crisis, nor any burning   imperative, the entrepreneurial spirit of the organisation   saw many new opportunities which made phase III easily   implemented.   Conclusions   It has become fashionable to suggest that organisations   should be in a constant state of change. In our view, this   is a fallacy. Successful change has to be anchored in   stability, else it runs the danger of provoking chaos. In   Gorbachev's Soviet Union, the simultaneous changes   unleashed after the fall of the Berlin wall were   tumultuous, and eventually uncontrolled and destructive.   There were few anchor points which could be used to   create stability. The upheavals have been so profound   and complete that change has gone out of control.   Arguably, many are worse off than they were under the   Communists. Whilst this may have been necessary and   inevitable in Russia after such a long period of   Communist hinking, it is surely not a model for   orchestrated change in a large Western firm. Inaction,   however, is not possible. The readers of this journal do   not need to be told that too much stability is dangerous.   If organisations are to survive, they need to orchestrate   change, else the world will overcome them, and they will   be 'selected out'.   560 European Management JournalVo114 No 6 December 1996   MAINTAINING STRATEGIC MOMENTUM: THE CEO'S AGENDA   The three waves of change at Unilever have been   remarkable, because they were energised from within,   without an obvious external threat. The first wave,   arguably, had been the consequence of the arrival of a   new person in the CEO team, who had a new   perspective. But in a large organisation, such a new   perspective is not enough to trigger changes, there must   be other factors which are favourable too. In our case,   these were also apparent. The second and third waves of   change were as remarkable, if not more remarkable than   the first. They represented repeated, successful attempts   to engineer upheaval in waves. The way that the   organisation responded to these upheavals was typical.   At the start the process was mainly top-down, but as   time passed there was a greater sense of bottom-up (or   more properly middle-up). In the eyes of the CEO, this   suggests that over a decade the organisation was   becoming significantly more entrepreneurial and recep-   tive to new ideas. It also suggests the bridging of that   difficult gap between different levels of management. For   those who believe that corporate ntrepreneurship is a  valuable but hard-to-create asset, this case study should   give hope.   Implementation f strategy has had a deliberate element   and an emergent one. On the deliberate side, there has   been a significant use of acquisitions and disposals, and   more recently the forming of alliances. Investments have   also been planned and carried out. But to suggest that all   was deliberate would be quite wrong. There was a large   element of the unforeseen and 'emergent'. As in all   companies, one never quite knows how things will turn   out, and the unexpected often arose. Morever, within   Unilever, the emergent was encouraged. There was a   strong sense of change flowing down from the top in a   cascading fashion, like water down the mountain stream,   gathering pace and energy as it moves.   Finally we note that the resolution of the paradox of   change and stability can be achieved in many different   ways. We have no evidence that the four-year cycles of   change are the best, and it is certainly not the only   mechanism. But we suggest that the idea may be   valuable for others facing similar challenges.

Management Innovation and Leadership:  The Moderating Role of Organizational Sizejoms_976 1..24  Ignacio G. Vaccaro, Justin J. P. Jansen,  Frans A. J. Van Den Bosch and Henk W. Volberda  Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University  abstract Recent research on management innovation, i.e. new managerial processes,  practices, or structures that change the nature of managerial work, suggests it can be an  important source of competitive advantage. In this study, we focus on management innovation  at the organization level and investigate the role of leadership behaviour as a key antecedent.  Due to its prominent role within organizations, top management has the ability to greatly  influence management innovation. In particular, we focus on leadership behaviour and  examine transformational and transactional leadership. Additionally, as contextual variables  like organizational size may influence the impact of leadership, we investigate its moderating  role. Findings show that both leadership behaviours contribute to management innovation.  Interestingly, our study indicates that smaller, less complex, organizations benefit more from  transactional leadership in realizing management innovation. On the other hand, larger  organizations need to draw on transformational leaders to compensate for their complexity  and allow management innovation to flourish.  INTRODUCTION  As competition intensifies and the pace of technological change accelerates, firms need  to renew themselves. The challenge is not only offering new products and services, but  also changing the nature of management within organizations. This can take place by,  for instance, adapting organizational structures, processes, and practices to generate a  valuable source of competitive advantage (Teece, 2007). Early studies such as Chandler  (1962) and, more recently, Mol and Birkinshaw (2008) clearly show how management  innovation may not only change an organization and bring potential benefits to it, but  also redefine an industry by influencing the spread of new ideas. Hence, scholars  have directed their attention towards management as a fertile ground for innovation  (Birkinshaw and Mol, 2006; Birkinshaw et al., 2008; Hamel, 2006, 2007; Mol and  Birkinshaw, 2006). Birkinshaw et al. (2008, p. 829) define management innovation as  Address for reprints: Ignacio G.

Accordingly, in this definition ‘newness’ is related to management innovation at  large, in other words, new to the world. Well known examples of management innova-  tion are lean production (introduced by Toyota) and brand management (developed by  Procter & Gamble) (Mol and Birkinshaw, 2008).  Given its importance for organizational performance (Birkinshaw and Mol, 2006;  Hamel, 2006), surprisingly little research has gone into explaining antecedents of man-  agement innovation. Management innovation entails an encompassing and complex  kind of change to the way in which management work is performed. For instance,  management innovations typically emerge without a dedicated infrastructure (such  as research labs – which aid technical innovation), and are relatively abstract and  intangible, which makes them potentially complex and ambiguous (Birkinshaw et al.,  2008). This underscores the relevant role of individuals within the organization, or as  Birkinshaw et al. (2008) put it, ‘the critical role of human agency’ (p. 826), which makes  the role of leadership especially relevant to management innovation.  This study contributes to the emergent dialogue on management innovation in at least  two ways. First, we investigate management innovation at the organizational level of  analysis by focusing on the pursuit of management innovation that is new to the firm, and  investigate CEO leadership behaviour as a key antecedent of management innovation.  This resonates with the rational perspective on management innovation (Birkinshaw  et al., 2008) which sees the actions of key individuals, such as leaders, as a crucial factor  driving the pursuit of management innovation. Scholars have proposed that leadership  can effectively stimulate innovative thinking (Zhou and George, 2003), and have shown  that it significantly impacts organizational choice (Finkelstein, 1992). Because manage-  ment innovation represents a rather encompassing change in the way management work  is performed, we see leadership as a preeminent issue in understanding how organiza-  tions introduce such a (potentially) complex type of innovation. In this study we draw on  the distinction between transformational and transactional leadership (Bass, 1985) and  uncover how each type of leadership behaviour affects the pursuit of management  innovation in organizations. Hence, this study deepens our understanding of the role  of human agency by studying how different leadership styles influence the pursuit of  management innovation within organizations.  Second, we investigate whether the role of human agency is related to organizational  complexity. For this, we consider the moderating role of organizational size. Prior studies  such as Nahavandi and Malekzadeh (1993) and Koene et al. (2002) have suggested  that the impact of leadership behaviour may decrease as organizational size increases.  Leaders in larger organizations may encounter more difficulty in initiating change in the  way management work is performed due to more complex organizational contexts and  increased spatial separation. In addition, increased bureaucratic formalization within  larger organizations may have a neutralizing effect on the impact of direct leadership  behaviour (Koene et al., 2002). Building on previous studies which asserted that the  impact of leadership behaviour is dependent on organizational size, we study different  types of leadership behaviour in relation to both larger, more complex organizations as  well as smaller, arguably simpler, ones.  I. G. Vaccaro et al.2  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  This paper is organized as follows. In the next section we present a review of the  relevant literature and develop our hypotheses. Subsequently, we present the findings  obtained from the empirical analysis carried out using a sample of organizations span-  ning different industries. We conclude with a discussion of our findings, implications,  limitations, and issues for further research.  LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESES  Management Innovation: Definition and Level of Analysis  Management innovation has been defined as the ‘generation and implementation of a  management practice, process, structure or technique that is new to the state of the art  and is intended to further organizational goals’ (Birkinshaw et al., 2008, p. 829). It  addresses changes in what managers do and how they do it (Hamel, 2006), which have  been argued to be very ambiguous and hard to replicate, hence more likely to lead to  sustainable competitive advantage and increased competitiveness (Birkinshaw and Mol,  2006; Hamel, 2007; Teece, 2007). Management innovation, then, relates to changes in  how managers set directions, make decisions, coordinate activities, and motivate people  (Hamel, 2006). These changes become part of the organization as management inno-  vation manifests itself through new management practices, processes, or structures.  In describing management innovation, Birkinshaw et al. (2008) identify four different  perspectives on management innovation: institutional, fashion, cultural, and rational  perspective. In line with Birkinshaw et al. (2008), our treatment of management inno-  vation throughout this paper remains close to the rational perspective. This perspective  assumes that new practices, processes, or structures are deliberately introduced by key  individuals within organizations in order to improve the organization’s performance.  Birkinshaw et al. (2008) reflect upon ‘two equally valid points of view’ (p. 828) regard-  ing the novelty of management innovation, namely, ‘new to the state of the art’ and ‘new  to the organization’. In the first instance, ‘new to the state of the art’ or new to the world,  the level of analysis is management at large, or indeed the world, as this definition implies  no known precedents. In the case of ‘new to the organization’, the level of analysis is the  firm. Focusing on this level of analysis enables us to empirically test a series of hypotheses  at the firm level of analysis and draw on a potentially much more sizable sample of  management innovations. While the development of management innovation that is new  to the world involves a greater degree of uncertainty, the introduction of management  innovation that is new to the firm is not without uncertainty. Firms, for instance, may be  able to draw on the practices that have previously been implemented elsewhere, but the  success of new practices may also depend on their adaptation to their idiosyncratic  context within the organization in which they are introduced (Ansari et al., 2010).  While a requirement for innovation, change in itself does not constitute management  innovation (West and Farr, 1990). For instance, downsizing may bring about change  to an organization, but is not related to management innovation if it represents a  unchanged continuation of managerial work. For management innovation to occur, the  implemented change should include novelty in the way the organization is managed by  means of new practices, processes, or structures, including their associated techniques.  Management Innovation and Leadership 3  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  An example of management innovation is self-managed teams, which involves the intro-  duction of teams responsible for their own internal functioning, setting of priorities, and  decision making within an organization (Bunderson and Boumgarden, 2010). The imple-  mentation of self-managed teams at Procter & Gamble (Lawler, 1990; Waterman, 1994)  exemplifies change in three facets of management innovation, i.e. practices, processes,  and structures. Management practices refers to what managers do as part of their job on  a day-to-day basis – setting objectives and associated procedures, arranging tasks and  functions, developing talent, and meeting different demands from stakeholders, for  example (Birkinshaw et al., 2008; Mol and Birkinshaw, 2009). The introduction of  self-managed teams at Procter & Gamble changed the work of managers as employees  became in charge of setting their own goals and deciding when and how tasks were going  to be performed. Management processes refers to the routines that govern the work of  managers, drawing from abstract ideas and turning them into actionable tools, which  typically include strategic planning, project management, and performance assessment  among others (Birkinshaw et al., 2008; Hamel, 2006, 2007). Following the introduction  of self-managed teams at Procter & Gamble, reward and promotion systems were  overhauled. Pay was determined in relation to skill, which in turn served as the basis  for promotion, as evaluated by fellow team members. Organizational structure, that is, how  organizations arrange communication, and align and harness effort from their members  (Birkinshaw et al., 2008; Hamel, 2007), was also altered at Procter & Gamble as hierar-  chical layers were removed following the adoption of self-managed teams.  Leadership and Management Innovation  Following Birkinshaw et al.’s (2008) focus on the role of human agency in management  innovation, we centre on the specific actions from individuals inside the organization by  focusing on leaders and associated behaviours. Due to their prominent role within  organizations, leaders affect organizational conditions under which management inno-  vation may be generated and implemented (Crossan and Apaydin, 2010; Hambrick and  Mason, 1984). Management innovation may not necessarily be developed by the CEO  or other executives within the top management team, however their role may be  instrumental in creating an organizational context conducive to experimentation with  and introduction of new processes, practices, or structures. For instance, leaders have  been shown to impact organizational outcomes such as performance (Haleblian and  Finkelstein, 1993) and choice (Finkelstein, 1992). Various studies have considered lead-  ership as one of the organizational attributes underlying change and innovation (cf.  Chandler, 1962; Kanter, 1984; Peters and Waterman, 1984). Elenkov et al. (2005)  described alternative ways in which leaders can influence innovation within the organi-  zation by means of their prominent position. Similarly, leaders may also impact man-  agement innovation by reducing uncertainty and complexity associated with its pursuit  (Birkinshaw et al., 2008) by communicating a shared vision, supporting change, and  developing a certain type of organizational culture. For instance, Marion and Uhl-Bien  (2001) suggest that leaders may have a significant role in simplifying complex dynamics  within organizations. That is, leaders may be able to help subordinates make sense of the  changes, and provide guidance and support when changes may seem ambiguous.  I. G. Vaccaro et al.4  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  Birkinshaw et al. (2008) point to ‘internal change agents’ as key individuals driving  management innovation which underscores the critical role of human agency in the  deliberate pursuit of management innovation. These key individuals within organiza-  tions are instrumental in identifying new trends in the environment and needs within the  organization for which management innovation may be desirable. They would also be  particularly important in supporting initiatives related to changing practices, processes,  or structures. By virtue of their position CEOs, and their associated type of leadership  behaviour, relate to this type of key individual. This has not gone unnoticed by either  academic or managerial authors, who have presented CEOs as key change agents within  the organizations they lead. An example of this is Lars Kolind who led the introduction  of the ‘spaghetti’ organization at Oticon, a Danish hearing aid manufacturer (Foss, 2003;  Larsen, 2002). This management innovation involved organizing around project teams  as opposed to departments, which led to a very flat organization which consisted of only  two layers: the CEO and ten other managers were the management team, while all other  employees were organized into projects. Kolind’s leadership was in many ways crucial  in the pursuit of this management innovation. He understood where the company was  and what the environment demanded, and articulated a compelling vision of where  Oticon should go. Moreover, he committed to personal development, responsibility, and  freedom among employees in order to foster intrinsic motivation. This resulted in a very  dynamic environment within Oticon in which employees were part of different projects,  and projects competed for resources in a market-like environment within the organiza-  tion (Foss, 2003).  The role of leadership has also been found to be relevant in employee willingness to  voice ideas aimed at improving the organization and the way in which it functions  (Detert and Burris, 2007). To address how specific leadership behaviours affect the  pursuit of new management practices, processes, or structures, we focus on transforma-  tional and transactional leadership. Drawing on the work of Burns (1978) and Bass (1985)  on leadership behaviours, transformational and transactional leadership have featured in  various studies in order to capture the extent to which leaders engage their subordinates  by instilling in them the organization’s goals, or clarifying the rewards that will follow  from the attainment of such goals (Rubin et al., 2005; Yammarino et al., 1997, 1998).  Building on this and other literatures on the topic (Atwater and Bass, 1994; Bass, 1990;  Howell and Avolio, 1993; Podsakoff et al., 2006), we develop hypotheses about how  transformational and transactional leadership influence management innovation.  Transformational leadership. Transformational leadership is aimed at the followers’ identi-  fication with its purpose and common goals. It stimulates employees to attain to orga-  nizational goals by appealing to high-level needs for self-actualization (Bass, 1985; Burns,  1978; Lindebaum and Cartwright, 2010). Transformational leadership consists of four  dimensions: (1) idealized influence; (2) inspirational motivation; (3) intellectual stimula-  tion; and (4) individual consideration (Avolio et al., 1999). Idealized influence represents  the degree to which leaders are admired, respected, and trusted. This dimension includes  charismatic behaviour that causes followers to identify with the leader and fosters a sense  of intrinsic motivation to achieve goals. Inspirational motivation provides meaning and  challenge to their followers, fostering team spirit and encouraging them to envision  Management Innovation and Leadership 5  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  attractive future states. Intellectual stimulation prompts followers to question assump-  tions and be creative. Transformational leaders ensure that creativity and innovation is  part of the problem solving processes. Individualized consideration includes the extent to  which followers’ potential is developed by attending to their individual needs, as well as  creating learning opportunities and a supportive environment for growth (Bass et al.,  2003).  Through idealized influence, transformational leaders may stimulate management  innovation by sharing the risk of innovative actions with followers (Bass et al., 2003),  thereby enabling and empowering followers to challenge existing management pro-  cesses, practices, or structures (Bass, 1994). Such leaders may also contribute to reducing  complexity by getting others to rally around them in the pursuit of management inno-  vation (Marion and Uhl-Bien, 2001), underscoring their credentials as change agents.  Through inspirational motivation, transformational leaders emphasize the relevance of  looking for new ways of doing things and encouraging synergies by working together  (Sosik, 1997), also giving the task a meaning and followers the challenge to thrive (Bass  et al., 2003). Inspirational motivation contributes towards followers’ intrinsic motivation,  a powerful drive to search for creative ways of addressing changes in managerial  processes, practices, or structures (Amabile, 1996, 1998).  Through intellectual stimulation, transformational leaders encourage followers to  question the effectiveness of the organization’s current management practices (Sosik,  1997). Transformational leaders show high expectations and confidence in followers’  ability to deliver progressive solutions rather than merely appropriate ones (Bass, 1994;  Jung et al., 2003), strengthening the stimuli for innovative thinking in the way work is  approached or structures set up. In this sense, intellectual stimulation challenges current  work practices and encourages followers to consider different angles as they perform  their jobs (Hunt, 1991). In so doing, it also serves the purpose of challenging followers by,  for instance, assigning them to the tasks they are best suited for according to their skills,  and encourages followers to look for creative solutions (Amabile, 1998). By means of  individualized consideration, transformational leaders are expected to display apprecia-  tion for each of the followers and their ideas (Sosik, 1997). Individualized consideration  also fosters attention and distributed participation in changing management practices  and processes (Bass, 1994) by letting followers know that their work matters and is valued  by organizational leaders (Amabile, 1998). Hence, we argue that transformational  leadership contributes to the advancement of novel managerial processes, practices, or  organizational structures.  Transformational leadership behaviour can affect all three facets of management  innovation, i.e. management practices, processes, and structures. Interviews carried out  at Royal DSM, a Dutch life sciences and material sciences company, provide anecdotal  evidence concerning the link between transformational leadership behaviour and the  management practices, processes, and structures. During the adoption of self-managed  teams at Royal DSM, transformational leadership behaviour from top management  stimulated changes in practices by giving teams of operators the freedom to take on roles  other than those included in their job descriptions. By removing the position of team  supervisor, senior management reinforced the teams’ ability to make their own decisions.  This intellectual challenge resulted in teams orchestrating their work differently. Simi-  I. G.

Meanwhile, the organizational structure of the plant was altered by the removal of  the team supervisor layer, yet teams could draw on a clear vision from senior manage-  ment to align their efforts with the company’s objectives.  Hypothesis 1: Transformational leadership will be positively related to management  innovation within an organization.  Transactional leadership. Transactional leaders engage in a transaction in order to satisfy  their respective wants (Burns, 1978), and provide extrinsic motivation to their subordi-  nates. Transactional leaders are primarily concerned with gaining compliance from  subordinates – which they will do by targeting their self interest – by agreeing upon the  conditions and rewards that will follow the fulfilment of certain requirements (Bass,  1990; Bass and Avolio, 1993; Yammarino and Bass, 1990).  The role of transactional leaders has also been argued to be closely related to the  reinforcement and refinement of institutionalized learning (Vera and Crossan, 2004),  which suggests that this type of leadership behaviour may be conducive to the pursuit of  management innovation as it may contribute to reducing organizational complexity  (Damanpour, 1996) and ambiguity through setting clear goals and rewards that under-  pin underlying changes in processes, practices, or structures.  Transactional leadership consists of two dimensions: contingent reward and active  management by exception (Den Hartog et al., 1997). Contingent reward entails the  clarification and specification of what is expected of organizational members and the  assessment of goals and subsequent reward for its accomplishment. Through contingent  reward, leaders build commitment to the fulfilment of ‘contracts’ with followers (Avolio  et al., 1999; Bass and Avolio, 1993). While the establishment of such contracts has been  argued to hamper creativity and result in less initiatives to address new ways of facing  work (Amabile, 1996, 1998), we maintain that the impact of contingent reward on  management innovation can be positive (Elenkov and Manev, 2005). This may be the  case through, for instance, an increased sense of fairness and justice in the workplace in  which unmet standards and objectives do not go unnoticed, while success is dutifully  rewarded (Podsakoff et al., 2006; Walumbwa et al., 2008). Furthermore, active manage-  ment by exception, on the other hand, involves the leader’s active involvement and  intervention to monitor and rectify any divergence from an agreed standard in the  follower’s work. Such involvement underscores the way in which change agents, i.e.  leaders, can drive the process of management innovation within the organization.  The introduction of self-managed teams at Royal DSM also illustrates how transac-  tional leadership affects management practices, processes, and structures. New manage-  ment practices, such as the loose definition of tasks and functions for individual team  members, were assessed against clear key performance indicators established by senior  management. Processes associated with the management of projects were run by  self-managed teams, with senior management stepping in to intervene when key perfor-  mance indicators seemed compromised. Some of these key performance indicators  were set at the team level, which ultimately affected the compensation structure of team  Management Innovation and Leadership 7  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  members. Placing reward and accountability at the team level, and changes in the  organizational structure such as organizing the plant round self-managed teams, prompt  teams to seek for better decision-making in order to meet their goals. In doing so, teams  began establishing new communication lines with other teams, as well as with different  internal stakeholders, such as technical and maintenance staff, in order to look for new  ways of improving efficiency.  Hypothesis 2: Transactional leadership will be positively related to management  innovation within an organization.  Leadership and Management Innovation: The Moderating Role of  Organizational Size  Prior studies have argued that the effectiveness of leadership behaviour depends on  contextual conditions, such as the stage of organizational growth, top management team  homogeneity (Alexiev et al., 2010; Nahavandi and Malekzadeh, 1993), organizational  climate (Shalley and Gilson, 2004), and mode of governance (Egri and Herman, 2000;  Pawar and Eastman, 1997). We focus on organizational size as contextual variable, as  size has been considered to capture the scope of operations differentiation and increased  bureaucratic complexity (Pawar and Eastman, 1997). Previous studies have offered  conflicting evidence regarding larger, more complex, organizations and innovation.  Some have suggested that larger organizations may be better suited to pursue innovation  (e.g. Baldridge and Burnham, 1975), yet evidence of the opposite has also been put  forward (e.g. Blau and McKinley, 1979). We argue that organizational size is a key  contextual variable in the study of management innovation as it relates to the underlying  added complexity of pursuing management innovation in organizations of different sizes.  The effectiveness of leadership has long been argued to be dependent on organiza-  tional size (Hambrick, 1989; Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Mintzberg, 1973). Nahavandi  and Malekzadeh (1993) propose that the impact of leaders decreases in larger organiza-  tions. Similarly, Koene et al. (2002) find that in smaller organizations, leadership has a  stronger impact than in larger ones. While direct and regular contact between leaders  and followers may suffice to set goals and effectively influence members’ behaviour while  organizations are small, as organizational size increases leaders may find it increasingly  hard to achieve the desired level of commitment (Atwater and Bass, 1994). First, the  complexity of communication increases in larger organizations and the difficulty of  members’ ability to express their opinions may diminish the effect of the leader’s impact  (Bantel and Jackson, 1989; Bass, 1994). In addition, scholars have studied the notion of  receptivity, which refers to how receptive members of an organization are to processes of  change (Hunt, 1991), and can vary according to the contextual factors such as organi-  zational size (Koene et al., 2002; Pawar and Eastman, 1997). Pawar and Eastman (1997)  argue that, while simple organizational structures will be more receptive to transforma-  tional leadership, larger, more specialized, and complex organizations will prove less  receptive. Accordingly, we expect organizational size to influence the effectiveness of  transformational and transactional leadership in the pursuit of management innovation.  I. G. Vaccaro et al.8  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  Transformational leadership and organizational size. Previous studies have argued that organi-  zational size plays an important role in how receptive members of an organization  will be to transformational leadership behaviour (Egri and Herman, 2000; Pawar and  Eastman, 1997; Yang et al., 2010). For instance, Egri and Herman (2000, p. 596)  conclude that ‘. . . smaller . . . organizations were more likely to have organizational  structures . . . that were highly receptive to transformational leadership’. In smaller orga-  nizations transformational leaders are expected to reach and interact more frequently  with followers, thereby increasing the level of commitment to management innovation  even more (Atwater and Bass, 1994). With regard to inspirational motivation, we expect  transformational leaders to be better able to convey their vision and arise individual and  team spirit to generate management innovation in smaller organizations. Berson et al.  (2001), for instance, reported that the content of the vision conveyed by the leader is  affected by organizational size. In their study, the authors propose that inspiring follow-  ers in larger organizations may be particularly challenging for the efficiency of leaders, as  ‘larger organizations are likely to be composed of a broader range of interests that a  leader may need to take into consideration when formulating a vision’ (Berson et al.,  2001, p. 68). In this way, conveying an unambiguous message becomes more difficult in  larger organizations. Similarly, we expect intellectual stimulation to be weaker in larger  organizations where transformational leaders may encounter difficulties in encouraging  followers to challenge the status quo and foster changes in management practices and  processes (Hunt, 1991; Pawar and Eastman, 1997). Finally, we expect transformational  leaders in larger organizations to be less able to provide followers with individual  consideration, thus displaying less appreciation for their ideas and creativity ( Jung et al.,  2003; Sosik, 1997), than in smaller organizations.  Hypothesis 3: Organizational size moderates the relationship between transformational  leadership and management innovation such that increased organizational size  weakens the positive effect of transformational leadership upon management  innovation.  Transactional leadership and organizational size. Similarly, we expect transactional leaders’  influence to be stronger in smaller organizations where transactions can be efficiently  established, monitored, and assessed. As organizational size increases, the direct impact  of transactional leadership and its receptivity may diffuse due to increased complexity  and difficulties to reach all members of the organization (Atwater and Bass, 1994; Hunt,  1991). The proliferation of formal structures and procedures in large organizations  changes the context in which leadership is exercised (Hunt, 1991). As mentioned earlier,  this type of leadership centres upon the completion of ‘contracts’ between leaders and  followers (Bass and Avolio, 1993). The larger an organization becomes, the more ‘con-  tracts’ (and associated control mechanisms) it needs in order to operate. This could give  rise to several levels of bureaucracy in which divergence from known management  processes, practices, structures, or techniques is discouraged. Hence, we expect transac-  tional leaders in small organizations to be better able to efficiently monitor their follow-  ers’ performance and be able to reward or reprimand such performance accordingly.  Similarly, we expect management by exemption to be most efficient in small organiza-  Management Innovation and Leadership 9  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  tions where transactional leaders would be able to monitor and timely correct deviances  from managerial processes, practices, structures, or techniques.  Hypothesis 4: Organizational size moderates the relationship between transactional  leadership and management innovation such that increased organizational size  weakens the positive effect of transactional leadership upon management innovation.  METHODS  Research Setting and Data Collection  We drew a random sample of 1000 Dutch firms from the REACH database, which  contains corporate information of all companies registered at the Chamber of Com-  merce in the Netherlands. The sample covered a broad range of industries and was  restricted to privately held firms with at least 25 employees. In 2006, we administered a  survey to one (non-CEO) respondent within the top management team (TMT) of each  organization. We addressed members of the TMT based on the information available  in our database. In line with upper echelons literature, due to the level at which they  operate we expected respondents at this level to be well informed about changes in  management practices, processes, and structures. Members of the TMT were also well  equipped to rate their CEO’s leadership style since, as direct reports, their relationship  and interaction with the CEO would be more regular. Targeting members of the TMT  also relates to the role of human agency in management innovation, particularly internal  change agents, as they will be key in driving, championing, and pursuing changes in  practices, processes, and structures (Birkinshaw et al., 2008). Because of this, we believe  these respondents were well suited to be part of our study and sufficiently knowledgeable  to provide adequate responses. Respondents were ensured confidentiality and offered a  summary of the results. Following the initial mailing of surveys, a second copy was sent  after a month, and follow-up calls were made two months after the first mailing. TMT  members from 151 companies returned usable questionnaires, corresponding to a 15.1  per cent response rate in our measurement sample. The respondents had an average  company tenure of 7.78 years (S.D. = 3.10), and the average size of the companies  measured in full-time employees was 103.46 (S.D. = 5.14). The firms were operating in  a wide range of industries: manufacturing 51.6 per cent, construction 20.5 per cent,  services 8.6 per cent, and others 19.3 per cent. To test for non-response bias, we  examined differences between respondents and non-respondents. T-tests showed no  significant difference based on the number of full-time employees. Additionally, we  compared early and late respondents in terms of demographic characteristics and model  variables. These comparisons did not reveal any significant differences (p < 0.05). Aside  from the risk of differences that there may be between respondents and non-respondents  in our dependent and independent variables, the data indicates no problems related to  non-response bias.  Assessment of common method bias. We took several steps to reduce the risk of this bias. These  steps spanned the design and administration of the survey, as well as statistical controls  I. G. Vaccaro et al.10  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  after the questionnaires were returned. During the design and administration of the  survey we explicitly assured respondent confidentiality, which serves the purpose of  reducing common method bias by making respondents less likely to modify their answers  due to social desirability or how they think others may expect them to answer. In  addition, we improved the scale items by using them in interviews with industry repre-  sentatives of a rank similar to that of respondents in this study (i.e. members of the TMT).  This helped us to use clear grammar and keep the survey concise.  Having received the questionnaires we performed several statistical analyses. First, we  carried out Harman’s one-factor test using the items included in our model. Should  common method bias be present, we would expect a single factor to be extracted and  account for most of the variance in the variables included in our study (Podsakoff and  Organ, 1986). Following our analysis we did not obtain such a single factor. Second, we  controlled for the effect of a single unmeasured latent method factor (Podsakoff et al.,  2003), a test used in numerous studies which employ single respondents. In this test, a  confirmatory factor analysis model is constructed such that all items are allowed to load  on their theoretical factors (theoretical model), and another in which they are also  allowed to load on a latent common factor. A comparison between the models is used to  assess the presence of common method bias. While a comparison between our theoreti-  cal model (c2 = 1208.09, d.f. = 492) and the model with the additional latent common  factor (c2 = 1020, d.f. = 459) indicates a better fit in the latter, less parsimonious model  (Dc2 = 187.75, D d.f. = 33, p < 0.001), the latent common factor accounted for a very  small portion (4.0 per cent) of the total variance compared with management innovation,  which accounted for 36.6 per cent of the variance explained. Taken together, the results  of our tests suggest that common method bias is not a pervasive problem in this study.  Measures and Validation of Constructs  Dependent variable. As a scale of management innovation at the organizational level is not  yet available, the following steps were taken to develop a new measure for this construct.  First, we reviewed relevant literatures on management innovation (Birkinshaw and Mol,  2006; Hamel, 2006; Kimberly, 1981; Mol and Birkinshaw, 2006) and generated a pool  of items to tap into the different facets of management innovation (i.e. management  practices, processes, or structures). From this pool of items, unique items were selected to  be included in the initial survey. During subsequent interviews, various industry repre-  sentatives were invited to suggest improvements to the survey items. Finally, the phrasing  of the items was further enhanced by the authors and peers, a process that resulted in a  final version of the measurement.  The resulting six-item measure for management innovation (a = 0.76) reflects the  manifestation of management innovation in new practices, processes, and structures.  Items 1 and 2 (management practices) tap into changes in what managers do as part of  their job in the organization, which includes setting new rules and associated procedures.  This may also result from the assignment of work to someone (i.e. task) and the duty to  perform such piece of work (i.e. function). Items 3 and 4 (management processes) relate  to how work is performed and include changes articulated in routines that govern the  work of people as well as how compensation is set up. This may be illustrated by changes  Management Innovation and Leadership 11  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  in management systems or changes in what is expected of people, which outcomes and  behaviour are rewarded and which are not, which relate to the way people are com-  pensated. Items 5 and 6 (structures) tap into the way in which organizations arrange  communication, align and harness their members’ efforts, which provides the context in  which work is performed. These items relate to changes in communication structure as  a sign of different ways of doing things, for instance by allowing different constituencies  to exchange information. Additionally, the formal structure of the organization could be  changed to bring about changes in communication, autonomy, and discretion. Overall,  our scale of management innovation reflects all three facets of management innovation,  focusing on what managers do, how they do it, as well as the organizational context in  which work is performed. An overview of the items used in this scale is provided in the  Appendix.  As opposed to measuring changes that belong to a particular example of management  innovation, we purposely chose to focus on new practices, processes, and structures  for two reasons. First, to tap into a larger pool of management innovations which may  have been labelled, e.g. a group of practices and processes developed at Toyota that has  been labelled ‘Lean Manufacturing’, or not. Second, to avoid problems associated with  different interpretations and delimitations of what constitutes a certain management  innovation. Lean Manufacturing, for instance, is described by Mol and Birkinshaw  (2008) as one of the top 50 management innovations since the industrial revolution, and  spans production, supply chain, design, and engineering (Karlsson and Åhlström, 1996;  Womack et al., 1990). It also includes other innovative practices, processes, and struc-  tures such as kanban (which is crucial for just-in-time systems), and the organization of  suppliers into functional tiers, which may affect, for instance, product development and  supply chain management.  In order to establish construct validity for our measure, we assessed the reliability and  validity of our measure of management innovation using a separate sample collected  through a survey administered in 2008. We obtained a random sample of 3,000 Dutch  firms from the REACH database and mailed questionnaires to a TMT member (non-  CEO) within each organization. From this sample, 863 surveys were returned, for a  response rate of 28.86 per cent. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) among the items  included in our scale of management innovation yielded a one-factor solution with an  eigenvalue of 3.25 and item loadings above 0.65, indicating evidence of convergent  validity in our measure. In order to test the discriminant validity of our measure we  included a four-item scale of innovativeness (adapted from Bell, 2005) which captured  the extent to which companies actively seek to be ahead of their competitors in imple-  menting new and innovative processes in their operation or releasing new products or  services into their markets. This measure of innovativeness was positively associated  (r = 0.29; p < 0.01) with our scale of management innovation. We first tested a Confir-  matory factor analysis (CFA) model in which each measurement item was constrained to  load on the scales they were associated with, i.e. management innovation and innova-  tiveness. The overall results showed acceptable fit (c2 = 315.72, d.f. = 34, GFI = 0.93,  CFI = 0.93, RMSEA = 0.098). All items loaded significantly (p < 0.01) on their res-  pective scales, providing evidence of convergent validity (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988).  We also computed an alternative one-factor CFA model which showed poorer fit  I. G. Vaccaro et al.12  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  (c2 = 1,644.67, d.f. = 35, GFI = 0.64, CFI = 0.58, RMSEA = 0.231), showing evidence of  discriminant validity (Bagozzi and Phillips, 1982).  Independent and moderating variables. Transformational leadership was assessed by a senior team  member response to items of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ-5X; Bass  and Avolio, 1995). Respondents rated the items on transformational leadership for his or  her executive director on a 7-point scale with 1 = ‘strongly disagree’ and 7 = ‘strongly  agree’. The four dimensions of transformational leadership consist of five items for  idealized influence, inspirational motivation, and intellectual stimulation, and four items  for individualized consideration. Because the dimensions are highly correlated (average  r = 0.75; p < 0.01) and past research has shown that the dimensions of transformational  leadership failed to exhibit discriminant validity in predicting outcomes, we averaged  the items to create a single index for transformational leadership (a = 0.94). Similar to  previous studies (Bono and Judge, 2003; Jung et al., 2003), we conducted subsequent  analyses using the composite index. Transactional leadership was measured with eight items  from the MLQ (Bass and Avolio, 1995). Following previous practice (e.g. Ensley et al.,  2006; Epitropaki and Martin, 2005; Lowe et al., 1996; Waldman et al., 2001) we used  the four-item scale of contingent reward and the four-item scale for active management  by exception to measure transactional leadership. We averaged the items to create a  composite index for transactional leadership (a = 0.70). To account for the moderating  effect of organizational size, we included the logarithm of the number of full-time employ-  ees (adapted from secondary sources) in our analysis.  Control variables. In order to account for potential alternative explanations, we included  several control variables. Following studies in which it is suggested that the age of senior  managers within organizations affects the extent to which such organizations engage in  change and innovation (Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Wiersema and Bantel, 1992), we  included in our model the logarithm of the CEO age. Previous studies have also suggested  CEO tenure to be negatively related to experimentation and change (Finkelstein and  Hambrick, 1990). In view of this we included in our analysis the logarithm of the number  of years the CEO had been active within the organization. Because top management team  size can affect the diversity and variety of the TMT (Siegel and Hambrick, 2005), we  included in our analysis the logarithm of the number of TMT members. Finally, to  account for potential industry-specific effects, we included four dummy variables for com-  panies active in manufacturing, construction, service, and other sectors.  ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  Table I presents the descriptive statistics and correlations between the study variables.  Table II shows the results of the regression analyses with management innovation as the  dependent variable. Four models were specified in this analysis (see Table II). The first  one (model 1) includes only the control variables. Subsequently the two leadership  constructs were introduced (model 2), then the moderating variable (model 3), and  lastly the interaction terms were added (models 4). To reduce the potential for multicol-  linearity, we followed Aiken and West (1991), and mean-centred the individual variables  Management Innovation and Leadership 13  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  T  ab  le  I.

Finally, we computed variance inflation  factors (VIF) to further assess whether multicollinearity was a concern in our sample. All  values were well below the cut-off value of 10 (Netter et al., 1990), indicating no risk of  multicollinearity.  The results show that our hypothesized positive relationship between transformational  leadership and management innovation (Hypothesis 1) was supported (b = 0.30;  p < 0.01). Hypothesis 2, in which we proposed a positive relationship between transac-  tional leadership and management innovation, was also supported (b = 0.25; p < 0.05).  In addition to these direct effects, we also hypothesized that the relationship between  leadership behaviours and management innovation would be less pronounced in larger  organizations. Although we found organizational size to have a moderating role upon  the relationship between transformational leadership and management innovation, it did  not support our hypothesized relationship (Hypothesis 3). In fact, we found that the  effectiveness of transformational leadership increases with organizational size (b = 0.28;  p < 0.05). To plot this interaction, transformational leadership and organizational size  took the values of one standard deviation below (i.e. low level) and above (i.e. high level)  their respected means. The plot of this interaction (Figure 1) shows a positive effect of  transformational leadership on management innovation in large organizations. More-  over, it also reveals that transformational leadership hardly affects the pursuit of man-  agement innovation in small organizations.

Vaccaro et al.16  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  While innovation in its broadest sense has received a great deal of attention from  researchers, insights into management innovation have only recently begun to emerge.  By applying management innovation to the organizational level of analysis, and focusing  on transformational and transactional leadership behaviours, this study reflects top  management’s impact on management innovation (Birkinshaw and Mol, 2006;  Birkinshaw et al., 2008). Our study contributes to new insights regarding the relative  influence of transformational and transactional leadership behaviours on management  innovation. Moreover, we show that the effectiveness of these leadership behaviours is  dependent upon organizational size. In this sense, as proposed by Hambrick and Mason  (1984) and Finkelstein (1992), we find that leaders are important internal actors within  organizations, and the kind of internal change agents (Birkinshaw et al., 2008) who  impact the implementation of new practices, processes, and structures. In addition to  Elenkov and Manev (2005), who provided evidence showing that leadership explained  top management’s influence on both product and organizational innovation, we provide  evidence of the direct association of transformational and transactional leadership  on management innovation, including the moderating effect of organizational size. Our  study also departs from others which, having centred on technical innovation, focus  solely on the positive association with transformational leadership (Howell and Higgins,  1990), or find transactional leadership to be negatively related (Lee et al., 2003). Our  findings reflect the role of human agency in the pursuit of management innovation as  they relate to the actions of key individuals within the organization who may initiate and  drive changes in practices, processes, or structures (Birkinshaw et al., 2008).  Our research findings provide evidence that transformational leadership contributes  to management innovation. Transformational leaders who inspire team success and  develop trusting and respecting relationships based on common goals enable organiza-  tions to pursue changes in management practices, processes, or structures. They consider  organizational members individually and generate greater predisposition to experiment  with changing organizational tasks, functions, and procedures. Moreover, they may even  promote organizational members to rethink existing structures and task specialization,  and reconsider new ways for the organization to ‘get things done’. Their leadership may  also be conducive to making sense of an otherwise ambiguous type of innovation where  goals and outcomes may not be as clear as in the case of, for instance, the development  of a new product through technical innovation. With this prominent role of transforma-  tional leaders, our study contributes to prior studies relating transformational leadership  to performance (Koene et al., 2002; Waldman et al., 2001), creativity (Mumford et al.,  2002), and technical innovation (Jung et al., 2003). We go beyond these previous findings  by providing evidence that transformational leadership is conducive to pursuing man-  agement innovation.  Although prior studies (e.g. Lee et al., 2003) have suggested that transactional lead-  ership may reduce the ability of organizational members to suggest new ways for  management and facilitate efforts for changing management practices (Amabile, 1998;  Lee, 2008), our study shows that transactional leaders do contribute to lowering potential  barriers associated with management innovation. This suggests, in line with Vera and  Management Innovation and Leadership 17  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  Crossan (2004), that transactional leadership may be helpful in the implementation  phase of management innovation – inducing organizational members to attempt to meet  targets not only by means of tried and trusted management methods, but also by setting  targets and rewarding organizational members contingent upon the attainment of goals  associated with management innovation. In this sense, management innovation may be  generated and directed from the upper-echelon in organizations while the implementa-  tion of certain management innovations may be monitored and rewarded accordingly to  pre-established goals. Alternatively, the relationship between transactional leadership  and management innovation may also be mediated by trust, which may help employees  cope with the potential uncertainty and complexity of new processes, practices, or  structures. As Avolio et al. (1999) suggested, contingent reward may be the basis through  which expectations by both leaders and followers evolve, and trust is generated as parties  honour their ‘contracts’ over time. The more ‘contracts’ are fulfilled over time, the more  organizational members are rewarded and the more transactional leaders may display  trust in their followers’ ambition to generate and implement management innovations.  In this sense, trust mediates the relationship between transactional leadership and  management innovation as trust may be translated into increased ‘freedom’ to diverge  from current management and engage in management innovation. Future research is  necessary to understand the emergence and implementation of management innovations  within organizations and uncover the relationship of leadership behaviour, trust, and  management innovation.  Regarding the potential moderating role of organizational size on the association  between transformational and transactional leadership and management innovation,  our study contributes to prior studies concerning the importance of incorporating  organizational contingencies when studying leadership attributes (i.e. Pawar and  Eastman, 1997; Shalley and Gilson, 2004). By influencing the complexity of commu-  nication structures and lowering the potential receptivity of organizational members,  our study argued that organizational size would decrease the effectiveness of transfor-  mational and transactional leadership. Surprisingly, however, we found that transfor-  mational leadership becomes more important for generating and implementing  management innovation in larger organizations. A potential explanation for this is  that in large organizations transformational leadership may mitigate the negative  impact of increased hierarchies and bureaucracies on members who may fail to make  sense of their role within the organization’s complex system of goals (Sarros et al.,  2002). Transformational leadership may complement an organization’s increasing  rigidity and bureaucracy by maintaining a sense of meaningfulness in members of  the organization, which may be more conducive to management innovation. An alter-  native explanation is that transformational leadership can cascade from upper echelons  through lower echelons such that in large organizations the message and intended  effect of transformational leaders can be observed throughout the organization as a  result of repetition of patterns across the different management layers (Bass et al.,  1987; Waldman and Yammarino, 1999). In this way transformational leaders may be  able to exercise not only direct leadership among those in contact with them, but also  distant leadership as their message cascades down the different management layers  (Vera and Crossan, 2004).  I. G. Vaccaro et al.18  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  Our study reveals that transactional leadership is more important in smaller organi-  zations when they want to pursue management innovation. In smaller organizations  ‘contracts’ may be more easily established and monitored, which may presuppose less  room for divergence from the managerial status quo (Bass, 1985). However, this may also  lead to repeated face-to-face interaction between transactional leaders and organiza-  tional members, which can lead to increased trust between the parties and extra effort  in their work (Ehrlich et al., 1990; Shamir, 1995). These arguments could help to explain  why under transactional leadership organizational members find the flexibility to  introduce changes conducive to management innovation. Our findings can also be  interpreted in light of different phases in the life of organizations. While organizations are  small, they may be under greater pressure to achieve short term goals, which would  emphasize transactions required by management (which offers a reward) from followers  (who offer their work). As organizations become larger, leaders may become more  transformational in order to instil in members of the organization that sense of urgency  to deliver.  Overall, our findings reflect Birkinshaw et al.’s (2008) rational perspective on man-  agement innovation, while underscoring the role of human agency. The role of leaders  in the pursuit of management innovation is relevant through both transactional and  transformational leadership behaviours, though this behaviour needs to be adapted  according to the complexity of the organization, operationalized in this paper as  organizational size.  This first effort towards operationalizing management innovation at the firm level and  uncovering the role of leadership is constrained by at least three limitations, which also  represent fertile ground for future research in this area. First, in this paper we have begun  to investigate how leadership can affect management innovation. Building on this, a  broader perspective may provide interesting avenues for further research. Multilevel  research into the interaction between firms, industry, and external environment may be  useful in order to better understand how management innovation is adopted and diffused  within and across industries, as well as the influence that is exerted by external factors  upon firms (Dijksterhuis et al., 1999). Past research in the financial sector ( Jansen et al.,  2006) has looked at the effects of environmental dynamism and competitiveness upon  innovation. Insights of this kind could contribute to investigating how environmental  characteristics influence the relationship between leadership behaviour and manage-  ment innovation.  Second, in measuring management innovation at the organizational level we con-  structed a new scale. While we took steps to assess the validity and reliability of our  measure, other studies may seek to enhance this measurement and test its viability by  applying it to different datasets. Moreover, the data we used were cross-sectional. Further  longitudinal research could contribute to this area by empirically testing the causal  relationships established in our model. Additionally, we relied on one member of the  TMT per organization who may have responded based on aspirations of change rather  than change itself. Multilevel analysis combining the view from the TMT with that of  other levels may contribute to our understanding of management innovation. Finally, we  have not investigated the impact of management innovation on organizational perfor-  mance. Therefore, future research could also focus on the outcomes of management  Management Innovation and Leadership 19  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  innovation. Management innovation has been explicitly defined as intended to further  the organization’s goals (Mol and Birkinshaw, 2006), and called upon in order to  overcome adverse performance (Volberda and Bosch, 2005). An increased understand-  ing of how and to what extent management innovation can add to an organization’s  performance is not only appealing for research, but necessary if this concept is to  gain acceptance as a key instrument to improve competitive advantage in the corporate  world.  Through this study we have contributed to the emerging literature on management  innovation in several ways. We have introduced a complementary construct of manage-  ment innovation that spans processes, practices, or structures that are new at the level  of analysis of the organization. Additionally, we have introduced a new scale at the  organizational level for this management innovation construct. Lastly, we have studied  the influence of human agency, that is, the role of two types of leadership behaviour and  their impact upon management innovation, as well as the moderating effect of organi-  zational size. Concluding, our paper illustrates the role of human agency in the pursuit  of management innovation by studying both transformational and transactional leader-  ship. While both types of leadership behaviour are relevant for management innovation,  smaller, less complex, organizations benefit more from transactional leadership while  larger organizations need to draw on transformational leaders to compensate for their  complexity and allow management innovation to flourish.

MANAGING POTENTIAL AND REALIZED ABSORPTIVE  CAPACITY: HOW DO ORGANIZATIONAL ANTECEDENTS  MATTER?  JUSTIN J. P. JANSEN  FRANS A. J. VAN DEN BOSCH  HENK W. VOLBERDA  RSM Erasmus University  Exploring how organizational antecedents affect potential and realized absorptive  capacity, this study identifies differing effects for both components of absorptive  capacity. Results indicate that organizational mechanisms associated with coordina-  tion capabilities (cross-functional interfaces, participation in decision making, and job  rotation) primarily enhance a unit’s potential absorptive capacity. Organizational  mechanisms associated with socialization capabilities (connectedness and socializa-  tion tactics) primarily increase a unit’s realized absorptive capacity. Our findings  reveal why units may have difficulty managing levels of potential and realized ab-  sorptive capacity and vary in their ability to create value from their absorptive  capacity.  The turbulence of the business environment has  ensured focused attention on knowledge as a dom-  inant source of competitive advantage. To survive  selection pressures, firms need to recognize new  external knowledge, assimilate it, and apply it to  commercial ends. This ability, referred to as ab-  sorptive capacity (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990), has  emerged as an underlying theme in strategy and  organization research. Recent research has focused  on the role of absorptive capacity in innovation  (Tsai, 2001), business performance (Lane, Salk, &  Lyles, 2001; Tsai, 2001), intraorganizational trans-  fer of knowledge (Gupta & Govindarajan, 2000;  Szulanski, 1996), and interorganizational learning  (Lane & Lubatkin, 1998; Lane et al., 2001; Lyles &  Salk, 1996).  Despite the growing interest in absorptive capac-  ity, few have captured the richness and multidi-  mensionality of the concept. Moreover, while most  studies have focused on the competitive benefits of  absorptive capacity, organizational antecedents  have been largely ignored (Lane, Koka, & Pathak,  2002). The lack of research regarding this link is  surprising, especially since Cohen and Levinthal  (1990) emphasized the importance of organization-  al mechanisms and suggested considering what as-  pects of absorptive capacity are distinctly organiza-  tional. Even when organizational antecedents have  been considered (e.g., Lane et al., 2001; Van Den  Bosch, Volberda, & De Boer, 1999), their relation-  ships with different dimensions of absorptive ca-  pacity have not been tested empirically. Although  the ability to absorb new external knowledge can  generate significant benefits (Cockburn, Hender-  son, & Stern, 2000; Zollo & Winter, 2002), organi-  zational antecedents may have differing effects on  dimensions of absorptive capacity and subse-  quently lead to different performance outcomes.  Zahra and George (2002), for instance, distin-  guished among four dimensions of absorptive ca-  pacity that constitute potential and realized absorp-  tive capacity. They argued that firms need to  manage these dimensions of absorptive capacity  successfully to obtain superior performance. Firms  focusing on acquisition and assimilation of new  external knowledge (i.e., potential absorptive ca-  pacity) are able to continually renew their knowl-  edge stock, but they may suffer from the costs of  acquisition without gaining benefits from exploita-  tion. Conversely, firms focusing on transformation  and exploitation (realized absorptive capacity) may  achieve short-term profits through exploitation but  fall into a competence trap (Ahuja & Lampert, 2001)  and may not be able to respond to environmental  changes. Examining differing effects of organiza-  The authors thank Marshall Schminke and the three  reviewers of AMJ for their constructive reviews.

The objective of this study is to address this issue  and to contribute to existing literatures in two  ways. First, we advance research on absorptive ca-  pacity by extending and empirically validating the  conceptual distinction between potential and real-  ized absorptive capacity (Zahra & George, 2002).  Potential absorptive capacity, which includes  knowledge acquisition and assimilation, captures  efforts expended in identifying and acquiring new  external knowledge and in assimilating knowledge  obtained from external sources (Zahra & George,  2002: 189). Realized absorptive capacity, which  includes knowledge transformation and exploita-  tion, encompasses deriving new insights and con-  sequences from the combination of existing and  newly acquired knowledge, and incorporating  transformed knowledge into operations (Zahra &  George, 2002: 190). To date, corresponding mea-  sures for dimensions that form potential and real-  ized absorptive capacity are still lacking. This  study differentiates among these dimensions and  further clarifies the distinctness of potential and  realized absorptive capacity.  Second, we contribute to research regarding the  link between combinative capabilities and absorp-  tive capacity (Kogut & Zander, 1992; Teece, Pisano,  & Shuen, 1997; Van Den Bosch et al., 1999). We  conceptually identify and empirically examine  how common features of combinative capabilities  affect dimensions of absorptive capacity. Previous  research states that common features of combina-  tive capabilities involve organizational mecha-  nisms that each influence absorptive capacity in  specific ways (e.g., Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000; Hen-  derson & Cockburn, 1994; Van Den Bosch et al.,  1999). No insights, however, have been gained into  how organizational mechanisms differently affect  the acquisition and assimilation (i.e., potential ab-  sorptive capacity), and the transformation and ex-  ploitation (i.e., realized absorptive capacity) of new  external knowledge. Hence, this study reveals how  organizational antecedents matter and examines  links between specific organizational mechanisms  as common features of combinative capabilities  and dimensions of absorptive capacity.  THEORETICAL OVERVIEW AND HYPOTHESES  As Cohen and Levinthal (1990: 131–132) argued,  absorptive capacity not only resides in firms, but  also in organizational units. In this article, we focus  on the unit level. The ability of units to absorb new  external knowledge depends on their levels of prior  related knowledge (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990).  However, mere exposure to related external knowl-  edge is not sufficient to ensure that a unit will  internalize it successfully (Pennings & Harianto,  1992). In addition to prior knowledge resources  (e.g., Verona, 1999), units need to develop organi-  zational capabilities, defined as combinative capa-  bilities (Kogut & Zander, 1992), that enable them to  synthesize and apply current and newly acquired  external knowledge (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000;  Kogut & Zander, 1992). Combinative capabilities  are path-dependent in their emergence and idio-  syncratic in detail; however they exhibit common  features (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000: 1116). These  commonalities involve organizational mecha-  nisms, such as cross-functional teams and partici-  pation in decision making, which each provide  specific ways of dealing with dimensions of ab-  sorptive capacity. Matusik (2002: 458), for instance,  related formal and informal structures to firm ca-  pabilities and specifically highlighted the impor-  tance of cross-functional coordination mechanisms  in creating a conducive knowledge context. Hen-  derson and Cockburn (1994: 66–67) argued that in  addition to cross-functional boundary-spanning  mechanisms, architectural or combinative capabil-  ities include control systems and dominant values  that influence the ability to access new external  knowledge and to integrate knowledge flexibly.  Similarly, Verona (1999) suggested that capabilities  aimed at absorbing external knowledge are strictly  linked to managerial structures, systems, and social  relations. However, the relationships among these  organizational mechanisms associated with combi-  native capabilities and dimensions of absorptive  capacity are still unclear. We suggest specific or-  ganizational mechanisms as common features of  combinative capabilities and examine how they in-  fluence potential and realized absorptive capacity.  To structure our analysis, we discuss three types of  combinative capabilities: (1) coordination capabil-  ities, (2) systems capabilities, and (3) socialization  capabilities (cf. Van Den Bosch et al., 1999: 556).  Organizational Mechanisms Associated with  Coordination Capabilities  Coordination capabilities enhance knowledge  exchange across disciplinary and hierarchical  boundaries (Henderson & Cockburn, 1994; Ma-  tusik, 2002; Teece et al., 1997). Common features of  coordination capabilities are cross-functional inter-  faces, participation in decision making, and job  rotation (Galbraith, 1973; Henderson & Cockburn,  1000 DecemberAcademy of Management Journal  1994; Van Den Bosch et al., 1999). These organiza-  tional mechanisms bring together different sources  of expertise and increase lateral interaction be-  tween areas of functional, or component, knowl-  edge. Units use cross-functional interfaces such as  liaison personnel, task forces, and teams to enable  knowledge exchange (Gupta & Govindarajan,  2000). Cross-functional interfaces result in lateral  forms of communication that deepen knowledge  flows across functional boundaries and lines of au-  thority. They promote nonroutine and reciprocal  information processing (Egelhoff, 1991) and con-  tribute to a unit’s ability to overcome differences,  interpret issues, and build understanding about  new external knowledge (Daft & Lengel, 1986).  Thus, cross-functional interfaces enhance the  knowledge acquisition and assimilation underlying  a unit’s potential absorptive capacity.  Hypothesis 1a. Cross-functional interfaces will  be positively related to acquisition and assim-  ilation of new external knowledge (that is, to  potential absorptive capacity).  In addition, cross-functional interfaces are bene-  ficial to integrating diverse knowledge components  and to creating a desirable amount of redundancy  within units (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990: 134; Daft &  Lengel, 1986). They support unit members in re-  thinking the systematic nature of existing products  and services and revisit the ways in which compo-  nents are integrated (Henderson & Cockburn, 1994).  Accordingly, cross-functional interfaces enable em-  ployees to combine sets of existing and newly ac-  quired knowledge. Moreover, cross-functional in-  terfaces provide an effective way of generating  commitment and facilitating the implementation of  decisions (Bahrami & Evans, 1987). Thus, cross-  functional interfaces increase transformation and  exploitation, which underlie a unit’s realized ab-  sorptive capacity.  Hypothesis 1b. Cross-functional interfaces will  be positively related to transformation and ex-  ploitation of new external knowledge (that is,  to realized absorptive capacity).  Participation in decision making indicates the  extent to which subordinates take part in higher-  level decision-making processes (Hage & Aiken,  1967). Participation increases the range of prospec-  tive “receptors” to the environment (Cohen &  Levinthal, 1990). These receptors selectively act on  new external knowledge and both filter and facili-  tate new external knowledge acquisition (Aldrich &  Herker, 1977). In addition, participation allows for  interplay among a variety of perspectives and leads  to a rich internal network of diverse knowledge  (Hage & Aiken, 1967: 510) that supports assimila-  tion of new external knowledge. Thus, exposure to  external knowledge sources through receptors and  the interplay between diverse knowledge struc-  tures enable knowledge acquisition and assimi-  lation and increase a unit’s potential absorptive  capacity.  Hypothesis 2a. Participation in decision mak-  ing will be positively related to acquisition and  assimilation of new external knowledge (that  is, to potential absorptive capacity).  Although conceptual research has suggested that  participation in decision making increases the  quantity and quality of ideas or proposals (e.g.  Pierce & Delbecq, 1977; Sheremata, 2000), it may  slow down transformation and exploitation of new  external knowledge considerably. Zaltman, Dun-  can, and Holbek (1973), for instance, argued that  participation facilitates the initiation of innovative  behavior, but hinders its implementation. Research  has indeed shown a negative effect of participation  on new-product development speed that stems  from the difficulty of gaining consensus (Atuahene-  Gima, 2003). Moreover, Lin and Germain (2003)  revealed that decentralization was inversely related  to customer product knowledge utilization. These  empirical results suggest that participation in deci-  sion making hampers information-processing effi-  ciency (Cardinal, 2001) and may decrease a unit’s  realized absorptive capacity.  Hypothesis 2b. Participation in decision mak-  ing will be negatively related to transformation  and exploitation of new external knowledge  (that is, to realized absorptive capacity).  Job rotation is the lateral transfer of employees  between jobs (Campion, Cheraskin, & Stevens,  1994). Job rotation has been assumed to enhance  redundancy as well as diversity of backgrounds, to  increase problem-solving skills, and to develop or-  ganizational contacts (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990;  Noe & Ford, 1992). Diverse knowledge structures  support explorative learning (McGrath, 2001) and  increase the prospect that new external knowledge  is related to existing knowledge. Rotation of em-  ployees who each possess diverse and varied  knowledge also augments a unit’s capacity for mak-  ing novel linkages and associations (Cohen &  Levinthal, 1990). Job rotation therefore enables the  acquisition and assimilation of new external  knowledge that constitute potential absorptive  capacity.  Hypothesis 3a. Job rotation will be positively  related to acquisition and assimilation of new  2005 1001Jansen, Van Den Bosch, and Volberda  external knowledge (that is, to potential ab-  sorptive capacity).  In addition, job rotation enhances the awareness  of employees’ knowledge and skills in other func-  tional areas within a unit (Campion et al., 1994).  Such awareness about where complementary ex-  pertise may reside increases employees’ ability to  identify opportunities for transformation and ex-  ploitation of new external knowledge (Cohen &  Levinthal, 1990: 133; Matusik & Hill, 1998). More-  over, job rotation develops organizational contacts  that promote the coalitions needed for successful  exploitation of new external knowledge (Mumford,  2000). Job rotation thus also increases transforma-  tion and exploitation of the new external knowl-  edge underlying a unit’s realized absorptive  capacity.  Hypothesis 3b. Job rotation will be positively  related to transformation and exploitation of  new external knowledge (that is, to realized  absorptive capacity).  Organizational Mechanisms Associated with  Systems Capabilities  Systems capabilities program behaviors in ad-  vance of their execution and provide a memory for  handling routine situations (Galbraith, 1973; March  & Simon, 1958; Van Den Bosch et al., 1999). They  typically exhibit common features, including for-  malization and routinization, that establish pat-  terns of organizational action (Cohen & Bacdayan,  1994: 555; Galunic & Rodan, 1998).  Formalization is the degree to which rules, pro-  cedures, instructions, and communications are for-  malized or written down (Khandwalla, 1977). Reli-  ance on rules and procedures reduces the  likelihood that individuals will deviate from estab-  lished behavior (Weick, 1979). Formalization acts  as a frame of reference that constrains exploration  efforts and directs attention toward restricted as-  pects of an external environment (Weick, 1979). In  this sense, formalization tends to limit the intensity  and scope of the efforts expended in knowledge  acquisition. Moreover, formalization also inhibits  rich, reciprocal knowledge interaction and hinders  individuals’ assimilation of new external knowl-  edge. Accordingly, formalization negatively influ-  ences acquisition and assimilation of the new ex-  ternal knowledge underlying potential absorptive  capacity.  Hypothesis 4a. Formalization will be nega-  tively related to acquisition and assimilation of  new external knowledge (that is, to potential  absorptive capacity).  Organizational units use formalization to re-  spond to organizational phenomena in known  ways (Daft & Lengel, 1986). Formalization supports  the retrieval of knowledge that has already been  internalized (Lyles & Schwenk, 1992) and enhances  the causal understanding of sets of tasks within  units. Accordingly, formalization increases the  likelihood that unit members will identify oppor-  tunities for the transformation of new external  knowledge (Galunic & Rodan, 1998; Zollo & Win-  ter, 2002: 342). Through formalization, units also  codify best practices so as to make knowledge more  efficient to exploit, easier to apply, and faster to  implement (Lin & Germain, 2003; Zander & Kogut,  1995). Formalization thus enhances transformation  and exploitation of the new external knowledge  underlying realized absorptive capacity.  Hypothesis 4b. Formalization will be positively  related to transformation and exploitation of  new external knowledge (that is, to realized  absorptive capacity).  Units pursue routinization to develop sequences  of tasks that require relatively little attention (Ga-  lunic & Rodan, 1998) and to ensure that inputs are  transformed into outputs (Perrow, 1967). Routine  tasks are invariable, repetitious, and seldom char-  acterized by unexpected and novel events (Hage &  Aiken, 1969; Perrow, 1967; Withey, Daft, & Cooper,  1983). Employees that execute routine tasks only  deal with a few exceptions and a narrow range of  problems (Perrow, 1967; Volberda, 1996). Routini-  zation therefore limits the search for new external  knowledge and narrows the scope of information  processing. Moreover, it also restricts interaction  among unit members (Daft & Macintosh, 1981; Gal-  braith, 1973) and decreases the range of unit mem-  bers interpreting new external knowledge. Thus,  routinization of organizational behavior decreases  a unit’s ability to acquire and assimilate the new  external knowledge underlying potential absorp-  tive capacity.  Hypothesis 5a. Routinization will be negatively  related to acquisition and assimilation of new  external knowledge (that is, to potential ab-  sorptive capacity).  Routine tasks establish automatic patterns of be-  havior and increase understanding of task relation-  ships. As unit members plan the handling of their  tasks (Daft & Macintosh, 1981), routinization pro-  vides efficient structures for collective action and  decreases efforts spent on decision making and im-  1002 DecemberAcademy of Management Journal  plementation (Cohen & Bacdayan, 1994). In this  sense, units that routinize organizational behavior  are able to efficiently transform new external  knowledge into existing sets of tasks (Cohen & Bac-  dayan, 1994). Additionally, as routine tasks are  well-practiced and predictable, they permit closely  coordinated exploitation of knowledge in pursuing  collective objectives (Adler, Goldoftas, & Levine,  1999; Gersick & Hackman, 1990; Grant, 1996). Ac-  cordingly, routinization enables a unit’s realized  absorptive capacity.  Hypothesis 5b. Routinization will be positively  related to transformation and exploitation of  new external knowledge (that is, to realized  absorptive capacity).  Organizational Mechanisms Associated with  Socialization Capabilities  Socialization capabilities create broad, tacitly  understood rules for appropriate action (Camerer &  Vepsalainen, 1988; Volberda, 1998). They contrib-  ute to common codes of communication and dom-  inant values (Henderson & Cockburn, 1994; Teece  et al., 1997; Verona, 1999) and exhibit two com-  monalities: connectedness and socialization tactics  (Adler & Kwon, 2002; Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998).  These organizational mechanisms refer to two as-  pects of social relations: the structural aspect, or  density of linkages, and the cognitive aspect, or  shared social experiences.  The density of linkages, or connectedness, serves  as a governance mechanism and facilitates knowl-  edge exchange (Jaworski & Kohli, 1993; Rowley,  Behrens, & Krackhardt, 2000). Dense networks are  advantageous for developing trust and cooperation  but increase the redundancy of information and  diminish access to divergent perspectives (Na-  hapiet & Ghoshal, 1998; Sethi, Smith, & Park,  2001). Accordingly, dense networks constrain unit  members to perform broad searches for a variety of  external knowledge sources. They “limit the open-  ness to information and to alternative ways of do-  ing things, producing collective blindness” (Nahapiet  & Ghoshal, 1998: 245). Therefore, connectedness in-  hibits the acquisition and assimilation of new exter-  nal knowledge (potential absorptive capacity).  Hypothesis 6a. Connectedness will be nega-  tively related to acquisition and assimilation of  new external knowledge (that is, to potential  absorptive capacity).  Connectedness develops trust and cooperation  and fosters commonality of knowledge (Rowley et  al., 2000). It encourages communication and im-  proves the efficiency of knowledge exchange  throughout units (Galunic & Rodan, 1998). In this  way, connectedness allows units to transform and  exploit new external knowledge (Zahra & George,  2002: 194). Moreover, connectedness reduces the  likelihood of conflict regarding goals and imple-  mentation (Rindfleisch & Moorman, 2001). Thus,  connectedness facilitates the transformation and  exploitation of newly acquired knowledge and de-  velops a unit’s realized absorptive capacity.  Hypothesis 6b. Connectedness will be posi-  tively related to transformation and exploita-  tion of new external knowledge (that is, to re-  alized absorptive capacity).  Organizational units use socialization tactics to  structure shared socialization experiences (Ash-  forth & Saks, 1996). Socialization tactics offer new-  comers specific information and encourage them to  interpret and respond to situations in a predictable  way (Jones, 1986). They lead to custodial role ori-  entations and the acceptance of the status quo be-  cause organization members seek a high level of  concurrence and conformance (Ashforth & Saks,  1996; Jones, 1986). Socialization tactics increase  the commitment of unit members to past policies  and procedures (Randall, 1987). They can create  mental prisons and lead to poor information search  as well as selective perception of information and  alternatives (Janis, 1982). Thus, socialization tac-  tics hamper the ability to tap into new external  knowledge sources (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990) and  impede a unit’s ability to acquire and assimilate  new external knowledge.  Hypothesis 7a. Socialization tactics will be  negatively related to acquisition and assimila-  tion of new external knowledge (that is, to po-  tential absorptive capacity).  Socialization tactics affect the establishment of  interpersonal relationships and lead to congruence  of values, needs, and beliefs among individuals  within units (Ashforth & Saks, 1996; Feldman,  1981; Van Maanen & Schein, 1979). They teach  newcomers a unit-specific language that facilitates  the comprehension of background knowledge and  communication with others (Chao, O’Leary-Kelly,  Wolf, Klein, & Gardner, 1994; Fisher, 1986). In this  way, socialization tactics enhance the combination  of newly acquired and existing knowledge through  facilitating “bisociation” among unit members  (Zahra & George, 2002). Moreover, socialization  tactics lead to strong social norms and beliefs,  which enhance commitment and compliance with  exploitation processes of new external knowledge  (Adler & Kwon, 2002). Thus, socialization tactics  2005 1003Jansen, Van Den Bosch, and Volberda  enhance transformation and exploitation of new  external knowledge.  Hypothesis 7b. Socialization tactics will be  positively related to transformation and ex-  ploitation of new external knowledge (that is,  to realized absorptive capacity).  METHODS  Setting and Data Collection  The empirical research was conducted at a large,  European, multi-unit financial services firm. The  firm has total assets of more than $350 billion and  ranks within the top 30 on the Fortune Global 500  in terms of total revenue in the banking industry. It  is a broad-based financial service provider having  branches in various countries; these branches are  geographically distinct entities with their own cli-  enteles. The products and services of the branches  cover asset management, insurance, leasing, equity  participation, corporate banking, and investment  banking. In 2002, we administered a survey to the  general managers of 769 organizational units in 220  branches in one country. To ensure confidentiality,  we agreed not to reveal the managers’ names and  asked them to return the questionnaire directly to  the research team. A total of 462 questionnaires  were returned, corresponding with a response rate  of 60.1 percent. The respondents had a mean com-  pany tenure of 7.7 years (s.d.   8.14). The average  size of the organizational units was 32.79 (s.d.    21.09) full-time employees.  To test for nonresponse bias, we examined dif-  ferences between respondents and nonrespon-  dents. A t-test showed no significant differences (p    .05) between the two groups based on the num-  ber of full-time employees of units and branches,  total assets of branches, and units’ prior perfor-  mance. We also compared the early and late re-  spondents in terms of demographic characteristics  and model variables. These comparisons did not  reveal any significant differences (p  .05), indicat-  ing that differences between respondents were not  related to nonresponse bias. To examine reliability  issues associated with single-informant data, we  surveyed two additional members of each respond-  ing unit. Both management team members and se-  nior employees responsible for coordinating units  were asked to participate. This follow-up survey  resulted in 96 responses from 71 units that were  comparable in size, age, and prior performance to  our full sample. We calculated an interrater agree-  ment score (rwg) for each study variable (James,  Demaree, & Wolf, 1993). The median interrater  agreement ranged from .68 to .93, suggesting ade-  quate agreement. In addition, examination of intra-  class correlations revealed a strong level of interra-  ter reliability: correlations were consistently  significant at the .001 level (Jones, Johnson, Butler,  & Main, 1983). We also performed Harman’s one-  factor test on items included in our regression  model to examine whether common method bias  augmented relationships. Because we found multi-  ple factors, and the first factor did not account for  the majority of the variance, we had little concern  about potential problems associated with common  method bias (Podsakoff & Organ, 1986).  Measurement and Validation of Constructs  This study mainly used existing scales from pre-  vious research. However, appropriate scales for po-  tential absorptive capacity, realized absorptive ca-  pacity, and job rotation were not available. The  following steps were taken to develop new mea-  sures for these constructs: First of all, we reviewed  relevant literature and generated a pool of items to  tap the domain of each construct. From this pool of  items, unique items were selected for inclusion in  initial scales. Next, we conducted in-depth inter-  views with 15 unit managers at different branches.  The managers were asked to complete the question-  naire and indicate any ambiguity regarding the  phrasing of the items. During follow-up interviews,  they were invited to suggest improvements to the  questionnaire. Subsequently, the phrasing of items  was further enhanced by the authors and peers, a  process that resulted in a final version of the ques-  tionnaire.  Potential and realized absorptive capacity. To  examine potential and realized absorptive capacity,  we sought to measure the dimensions that have  been defined (Zahra & George, 2002). Items were  measured on a seven-point disagree/agree scale and  were partially based on existing items regarding  absorptive capacity (Szulanski, 1996) and market  orientation (Jaworski & Kohli, 1993). The Appendix  presents the items of potential and realized absorp-  tive capacity we used in our study. Potential ab-  sorptive capacity consists of acquisition and assim-  ilation of new external knowledge. Six items  assessed the intensity and direction of efforts ex-  pended in knowledge acquisition. In addition,  three items measured assimilation and gauged the  extent to which units were able to analyze and  understand new external knowledge. The scales for  acquisition and assimilation were reliable (acquisi-  tion,     .79; assimilation,     .76). Realized ab-  sorptive capacity includes transformation and ex-  ploitation of new external knowledge. Six items  measured transformation and assessed the extent  1004 DecemberAcademy of Management Journal  to which units were able to facilitate recognizing  opportunities and consequences of new external  knowledge for existing operations, structures, and  strategies (Zahra & George, 2002). Six items tapped  into the extent to which units were able to exploit  new external knowledge. The scale gauged the abil-  ity of units to incorporate new external knowledge  into their operations. Both scales were reliable  (transformation,     .72; exploitation,     .71).  We conducted confirmatory factor analysis  (CFA) of the items pertaining to dimensions of po-  tential and realized absorptive capacity in order to  check for construct independence. Each item was  allowed to load only on the factor for which it was  a proposed indicator. Results indicated that a four-  factor model fitted the data moderately well ( 2/  df   2.76, goodness-of-fit index [GFI]   .91, com-  parative fit index [CFI]   .90, root-mean-square  error of approximation [RMSEA]   .06). Item load-  ings were as proposed and were significant (p    .001), providing evidence for convergent validity.  The hypothesis that the four underlying dimen-  sions of absorptive capacity converged on one com-  mon factor was unambiguously rejected (  26    1,097.00, p   .001). Our four-factor model also  provided a better fit to the data than its plausible  rival two-factor model. All the fit indexes of the  two-factor model were worse than those of our  four-factor model. In addition, a chi-square differ-  ence test showed that the fit of the three-factor  model was significantly worse than that of our four-  factor model (  25   840.03, p   .001). Accord-  ingly, we judged the four dimensions underlying  potential and realized absorptive capacity to be not  only theoretically, but also empirically distinguish-  able.  To further assess the construct validity of the  measures for potential and realized absorptive ca-  pacity, we compared the scores of the study vari-  ables with a separate overall measure of absorptive  capacity (Szulanski, 1996). Using a nine-item scale  (    .90), respondents described their unit’s ability  to absorb new external knowledge regarding a new  knowledge-intensive financial service, employee  benefits, that had been released six months before  the initial questionnaire. Correlations between the  study variables and the overall measure of absorp-  tive capacity regarding the new financial service  were positive and significant (acquisition, r   .44,  p   .001; assimilation, r   .37, p   .001; transfor-  mation, r   .34, p   .001; exploitation, r   .24, p    .001), suggesting evidence for convergent validity.  In addition, we collected archival data through in-  ternal corporate records on the average number of  services regarding employee benefits purchased by  clients. Correlations between the study variables  and this service performance measure were also  positive and significant (acquisition, r   .23, p    .001; assimilation, r   .13, p   .01; transformation,  r   .22, p   .001; exploitation, r   .14, p   .01),  suggesting that organizational units with higher  levels of potential and realized absorptive capaci-  ties obtained higher levels of service performance  regarding the new financial service.  Organizational mechanisms associated with  combinative capabilities. To measure cross-func-  tional interfaces, we asked managers to indicate the  extent to which their unit used liaison personnel,  temporary task forces, and permanent teams to co-  ordinate activities (Galbraith, 1973). The final mea-  sure was a weighted average of the three items (cf.  Gupta & Govindarajan, 2000), ranging from 1 for  liaison personnel to 3 for permanent teams (x̄    4.39; s.d.   1.18). We used the construct of partic-  ipation in decision making (Dewar, Whetten, &  Boje, 1980; Hage & Aiken, 1967) to measure partic-  ipation (    .79). Job rotation was measured with  two items that tapped the extent to which employ-  ees were rotated between different functions within  and between subunits (    .77). The items were as  follows: “Employees in our unit are regularly ro-  tated between different functions” and “Employees  are regularly rotated between different subunits.”  To measure formalization, we used a five-item  scale (    .73) from Desphandé and Zaltman  (1982). Routinization tapped the extent to which  tasks within units were invariable, uniform, or pre-  dictable (Withey, Daft, & Cooper, 1983). Withey et  al.’s (1983) exceptions scale, which is based on  Perrow’s (1967) work on unit technology, was the  measure of routinization (    .73) . Connectedness  (    .74) was measured with a four-item scale  (Jaworski & Kohli, 1993). Connectedness measured  the extent to which individuals in organizational  units were networked to various levels of the hier-  archy. We used two categorizations of Van Maanen  and Schein’s model (1979: 232) to measure social-  ization tactics: collective versus individual and se-  rial versus disjunctive tactics (cf. Jones, 1986). Pre-  vious research has suggested that these two  categorizations affect custodial role orientations, the  congruence of values and beliefs, and newcomer ad-  justment to organizations (Ashforth & Saks, 1996;  Grant & Bush, 1996). Since we were interested in the  overall effect of socialization tactics, we constructed a  measure for socialization tactics by averaging the  scores of collective socialization tactics (    .74) and  serial socialization tactics (    .76).  An integrated CFA on all items of potential and  realized absorptive capacity and organizational  mechanisms associated with combinative capabili-  ties (with each item constrained to load only on the  2005 1005Jansen, Van Den Bosch, and Volberda  factor for which it was the proposed indicator)  yielded a model that fitted the data moderately well  ( 2/df   2.40, GFI   .90, CFI   .90, RMSEA   .06).  Item loadings were as proposed and significant  (p   .01). The scale for cross-functional interfaces  was not subjected to confirmatory factor analysis  because of the weighted structure.  Control variables. As larger units may have  more resources, yet may lack the flexibility to ac-  quire and assimilate new external knowledge, we  included the natural logarithm of the number of  full-time employees within units to account for  unit size. Following the same reasoning, we in-  cluded branch size as well, calculating it as the  natural logarithm of the number of full-time em-  ployees within a branch (average: 136.36 full-time  employees). A unit’s age, measured by the number  of years from its founding, was included since age  may influence knowledge acquisition and exploi-  tation (Autio, Sapienza, & Almeida, 2000). To con-  trol for the effect of units’ potential specialization  in different markets and different ranges of prod-  ucts and services, we included unit client focus,  which indicated whether a unit provided products  and services for private clients (coded 0) or for  business clients (coded 1). Units with a strong his-  tory of high performance are more likely to invest  in absorptive capacity. Hence, we included a unit’s  past performance. Because units may have differ-  ent strategic priorities, we adjusted performance  data to evaluate each unit. Following Tsai (2001),  we used a unit’s profitability-achieved rate, calcu-  lated as profitability divided by target profitability.  We also controlled for branch’s past performance  and included a branch’s profitability-achieved rate,  a branch’s return on investment divided by its tar-  get return. The performance measures, as well as  the achieved rates for the units and branches in this  study, were collected for the period 1999–2001  through internal corporate records. Environmental  aspects may trigger units to develop their potential  or realized absorptive capacity. Accordingly, we  included a dummy variable, urban/rural unit loca-  tion (0   “rural location”; 1   “urban location”) to  account for different business dynamics such as  market concentration and competitiveness (Dietz,  Pugh, & Wiley, 2004). The urban/rural data were  collected through internal corporate records. Envi-  ronmental dynamism can trigger a unit to develop  potential absorptive capacity (Zahra & George,  2002). We therefore included a three-item scale  (    .75) that captured environmental dynamism  (Dill, 1958; Volberda & Van Bruggen, 1997). Sample  items are, “Our clients regularly ask for complete  new products and services” and “In our market,  changes are taking place continuously.”  ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  Table 1 presents descriptive statistics and corre-  lations for the study variables. To examine the is-  sue of multicollinearity, we calculated variance in-  flation factors (VIFs) in each of the regression  equations. The maximum VIF within the models  was 1.44, which was well below the rule-of-thumb  cut-off of 10 (Neter, Wasserman, & Kutner, 1990).  Results of the Analyses  Table 2 presents the results of the hierarchical  regression analyses for organizational mechanisms  and both components of absorptive capacity. Un-  standardized coefficients, with standard errors in  parentheses, as well as standardized coefficients  are reported. Models 1 and 2 relate to potential  absorptive capacity. As expected, organizational  mechanisms associated with coordination capabil-  ities had positive and significant effects on poten-  tial absorptive capacity. In particular, coefficients  indicated that cross-functional interfaces (acquisi-  tion, p  .01; assimilation, p  .01) and job rotation  (acquisition, p   .01; assimilation, p   .05) en-  hanced a unit’s potential absorptive capacity, con-  sistently with Hypotheses 1a and 3a. Regarding  Hypothesis 2a, we found mixed results. Participa-  tion in decision making was positively associated  with acquisition (p   .001), but not with assimila-  tion (p   .10). Thus, participation in decision  making only triggers unit members to acquire new  external knowledge. The coefficients for formaliza-  tion (acquisition, p   .10; assimilation, p   .10)  were not significant. Hypothesis 4a was not sup-  ported. Routinization of tasks (acquisition, p    .001; assimilation, p   .05) had significant and  negative effects on acquisition and assimilation of  new external knowledge, supporting Hypothesis  5a. Accordingly, the negative effect of organization-  al mechanisms associated with systems capabilities  on potential absorptive capacity mainly originated  from routinization of tasks. Hypothesis 6a, which  posits a negative influence of connectedness on a  unit’s potential absorptive capacity, was not sup-  ported. Results showed that connectedness did not  affect acquisition (p   .10) and even positively  influenced assimilation (p  .01). Thus, contrary to  our prediction, connectedness enhanced the assim-  ilation of new external knowledge. Hypothesis 7a,  which claims a negative relationship between so-  cialization tactics and potential absorptive capac-  ity, was also not supported. The coefficients (acqui-  sition, p   .10; assimilation, p   .10) were not  significant. Thus, connectedness and socialization  1006 DecemberAcademy of Management Journal  tactics do not disrupt acquisition and assimilation  of new external knowledge.  Models 3 and 4 in Table 2 present the results of  the hierarchical regression analysis for organiza-  tional antecedents and realized absorptive capac-  ity. The coefficients for cross-functional interfaces  (transformation, p   .05; exploitation, p   .10) and  job rotation (transformation, p   .05; exploitation,  p  .10) were positive and significant for transfor-  mation; however, they were not significant for ex-  ploitation. Hypotheses 1b and 3b receive support  only in model 3: that is, they are supported for  transformation of new external knowledge. Cross-  functional interfaces and job rotation did not in-  crease exploitation of knowledge underlying real-  ized absorptive capacity. Participation in decision  making (transformation, p   .05; exploitation, p    .10) had no significant, negative effect on realized  absorptive capacity. Contrary to our prediction,  participation in decision making even increased  transformation of new external knowledge. Hy-  pothesis 2b was not supported. As hypothesized,  formalization (transformation, p   .05; exploi-  tation, p   .001) positively influenced a unit’s  realized absorptive capacity. Hypothesis 4b was  supported. The coefficients for routinization (trans-  formation, p  .01; exploitation, p  .10) were both  negative and only significant for transformation.  Hypothesis 5b, positing a positive relationship be-  tween routinization and realized absorptive capac-  ity, was not supported. Coefficients for connected-  ness (transformation p   .001; exploitation, p    .001) and socialization tactics (transformation, p    .001; exploitation, p   .001) were positive and  highly significant. In accordance with Hypotheses  6b and 7b, connectedness and socialization tactics  increased a unit’s realized absorptive capacity.1  Comparison of Relative Effects  To gain further insights into the relative effects  of organizational antecedents on potential and  realized absorptive capacity, we determined the  relative importance of each set of organizational  mechanisms (that is, associated with each type of  combinative capability) over another, by per-  forming F-tests involving both the full and re-  1 We ran additional regression analyses to examine  curvilinear relationships. Results revealed an inverted  U-shaped relationship between cross-functional inter-  faces and transformation. Thus, although cross-func-  tional interfaces contribute to transformation, using  many liaison persons, task forces, and cross-functional  teams may eventually hurt transformation by creating too  much redundancy among unit members.

Hansen & Wernerfelt, 1989;  Kotha & Nair, 1995). Results suggested several  important issues. First, acquisition of new exter-  nal knowledge was most strongly affected by or-  ganizational mechanisms associated with coordi-  nation capabilities; organizational mechanisms  associated with socialization capabilities had lit-  tle or no impact. Second, organizational mecha-  nisms associated with coordination and social-  ization capabilities primarily explained  assimilation of new external knowledge. Interest-  ingly, organizational mechanisms associated  with socialization capabilities had the strongest  effect. Third, the effects of organizational mech-  anisms associated with socialization capabilities  on transformation and exploitation (i.e. realized  absorptive capacity) were stronger than organiza-  tional mechanisms associated with either coordi-  nation capabilities or systems capabilities. Con-  nectedness and socialization tactics, for instance,  accounted for more than three times as much  variance of transformation as cross-functional in-  terfaces, participation in decision making, and  job rotation.  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  The objective of this study was to explore the  differing effects of organizational antecedents on a  unit’s potential and realized absorptive capacity.  Although research has been devoted to outcomes of  absorptive capacity, organizational antecedents of  absorptive capacity have been largely ignored. In  addition, research into absorptive capacity has only  begun to explore components and dimensions.  This empirical study assessed potential and real-  ized absorptive capacity and examined the links  between specific organizational mechanisms as  common features of combinative capabilities and  dimensions of absorptive capacity.

Most importantly, our results reveal that or-  ganizational mechanisms associated with combina-  tive capabilities drive a unit’s potential and real-  ized absorptive capacity in different ways. The  present study contributes to scholars’ understand-  ing as to why certain units are able to acquire and  assimilate new external knowledge, but are not able  to transform and exploit it successfully. Overall,  our research indicates that organizational mecha-  nisms associated with coordination capabilities  (cross-functional interfaces, participation, and job  rotation) primarily enhance potential absorptive  capacity, while organizational mechanisms associ-  ated with socialization capabilities (connectedness  and socialization tactics) primarily strengthen real-  ized absorptive capacity. These results reveal that  organizational units may differ in their ability to  manage levels of potential and realized absorptive  capacity; follow different developmental paths;  and differ in their ability to create value from their  absorptive capacity.  Our findings indicate that organizational mecha-  nisms associated with coordination capabilities en-  hance a unit’s potential absorptive capacity. Partic-  ipation in decision making, however, only  increases acquisition of new external knowledge; it  does not enhance assimilation of newly acquired  knowledge. A possible explanation for this result is  that participation in decision making does not nec-  essarily result in collective assimilation efforts, but  rather, leads to lower-level assimilation of new ex-  ternal knowledge by narrowly focused unit mem-  bers. Future studies may incorporate different lev-  els of analyses to investigate the unanticipated  effect of participation in decision making on assim-  ilation of new external knowledge. Although cross-  functional interfaces, participation in decision  making, and job rotation have relatively little im-  pact, they also enhance a unit’s realized absorptive  capacity. However, these organizational mecha-  nisms only increase transformation of new external  knowledge; they are not related to exploitation.  These results suggest that exploitation requires  more stable and densely connected knowledge  structures than does transformation. The temporal  nature of cross-functional interfaces and job rota-  tion indeed fosters acquisition, assimilation, and  transformation of new external knowledge, but this  augmentation may be insufficient to embed new  external knowledge into systems and structures  (Matusik & Hill, 1998). Moreover, results indicate  that participation does not negatively influence  transformation as predicted, but rather, it posi-  tively influences transformation through initiating  new ideas, insights, and opportunities.  The organizational mechanisms associated with  systems capabilities provide somewhat surprising  results. Firstly, although formalization contributes  to a unit’s realized absorptive capacity as we pre-  dicted, it does not decrease a unit’s potential ab-  sorptive capacity. One main reason could be that  acquisition and assimilation may be formalized to  some extent. Well-designed rules and procedures  capture prior experiences that may enable employ-  ees to search for, and assimilate, new external  knowledge (Adler & Borys, 1996). Secondly, our  study confirms that routinization negatively influ-  ences a unit’s potential absorptive capacity. How-  ever, contrary to our prediction, it also shows that  routinization negatively influences transformation  underlying a unit’s realized absorptive capacity.  Although it has been suggested that routinization  enhances efficient integration of existing knowl-  edge (cf. Gersick & Hackman, 1990; Grant, 1996),  our study reveals that it impedes the flexible incor-  poration of newly acquired and existing knowledge  (Volberda, 1996). These two contradicting results  regarding systems capabilities highlight the bene-  fits of codifying established behavior over holding  it tacit (Zollo & Winter, 2002). In contrast to making  established behavior tacit through routinization,  codification efforts through formalization enhance  a unit’s ability to transform and exploit new exter-  nal knowledge, and to initiate the recombinations  necessary for developing new competences and ca-  pabilities (Galunic & Rodan, 1998; Zollo & Winter,  2002). Routinization seems to separate knowledge,  to constrain joint learning, and to restrict the cre-  ation of new knowledge by imposing existing  knowledge (Dougherty, 1992).  Our findings reveal the relative importance of  organizational mechanisms associated with social-  ization capabilities in enhancing realized absorp-  tive capacity. Interestingly, we found a strong and  positive effect of connectedness on potential ab-  sorptive capacity or, in particular, the assimilation  of new external knowledge. To some degree this  pattern bears similarities to findings of other recent  studies suggesting that low connectedness in-  creases overall access to diverse knowledge  sources, yet may not be sufficient to support a  regular and reliable flow of knowledge (e.g., Han-  sen, 1999). A dense network within units may mo-  tivate employees to be of assistance to each other  and may allow two-way interaction that helps the  interpretation and understanding of new external  knowledge (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990; Morrison,  2002). Our study suggests that in addition to estab-  2005 1009Jansen, Van Den Bosch, and Volberda  lishing ties with external sources of new knowl-  edge (Hansen, 1999; Tsai, 2001), establishing dense  networks of ties within units is needed for units to  assimilate, transform, and exploit new external  knowledge. Moreover, findings indicate that social-  ization tactics do not disrupt acquisition and as-  similation of new external knowledge. Although  previous studies have suggested that socialization  tactics result in custodial role orientations and  well-established norms and beliefs, future research  may explore the intent of these tactics and investi-  gate to what extent certain socialization tactics con-  tribute to an orientation toward openness.  The present study advances understanding of com-  binative capabilities through conceptually identify-  ing and empirically examining common features of  coordination, systems, and socialization capabili-  ties. The idea that effective combinative capabili-  ties for absorbing new external knowledge exhibit  common features does not imply that a particular  type of combinative capability is identical across  units (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000). Our findings  reveal, for instance, that cross-functional inter-  faces, such as liaison devices and cross-functional  teams, positively influence acquisition and assim-  ilation of new external knowledge. However, the  composition of cross-functional teams or location  of liaison devices may be idiosyncratic to units.  Moreover, formalization strongly increases the  level of a unit’s realized absorptive capacity. How-  ever, units may use various rules and procedures  that differ in design and content, thereby executing  formalization differently and developing idiosyn-  cratic systems capabilities. Thus, effective coordi-  nation, systems, and socialization capabilities may  differ in details as long as important commonalities  like those identified and examined in our study are  present (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000: 1110).  From a strategic management perspective, we as-  sume that performance differences may arise when  units vary in developing effective combinative ca-  pabilities and pursue different developmental paths  of potential and realized absorptive capacity. Previ-  ous research has suggested that market dynamism  moderates the effectiveness of both components of  absorptive capacity (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000;  Zahra & George, 2002). To gain preliminary insights  into these strategic implications, we collected perfor-  mance data through internal corporate records and  included four interaction terms: acquisition and dy-  namism, assimilation and dynamism, transformation  and dynamism, and exploitation and dynamism. Us-  ing a unit’s financial performance as dependent vari-  able, with all control variables included, we found  that units with well-developed potential absorp-  tive capacity ( acquisition*dynamism   .10, p   .01;   assimilation*dynamism  .11, p  .01) improved their per-  formance in dynamic environments. Interestingly, coef-  ficients for realized absorptive capacity and environ-  mental dynamismweremixed ( transformation*dynamism   .08, p   .10;  exploitation*dynamism    .12, p   .01). Or-  ganizational units with well-developed realized ab-  sorptive capacity do not necessarily increase their  performance in dynamic environments. Rather, ex-  ploitation even decreases performance in dynamic  environments. Overall, these preliminary findings  have two interesting implications. First, organization-  al units operating in dynamic markets improve their  performance by increasing their potential absorptive  capacity. Potential absorptive capacity provides or-  ganizational units with strategic advantages, such as  greater flexibility in reconfiguring resources and ef-  fective timing of knowledge deployment at lower  costs, which are necessary to sustain a competitive  advantage (Zahra & George, 2002: 195–196). Second,  organizational units may not always be better off by  fully realizing their potential absorptive capacity in  dynamic environments. Although realized absorptive  capacity promotes innovation, the resultant products  and services may rapidly converge to industry stan-  dards (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000; Zahra & George,  2002) and become obsolete relative to current envi-  ronmental demands (Sorensen & Stuart, 2000). Ac-  cordingly, units operating in dynamic markets need  to selectively act upon their potential absorptive ca-  pacity and only exploit certain aspects of newly ac-  quired knowledge. These findings suggest managing  levels of potential and realized absorptive capacity in  a timely fashion is the logic for competitive advantage  (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000).  Limitations  Several limitations of this study merit discus-  sion. First, our data were self-reported assessments  of unit managers. Although we took several steps in  both the design and testing phases to limit concerns  regarding single-informant data, the issues of key  informant bias and common method bias cannot be  totally ruled out. However, strong interrater agree-  ment and interrater reliability, together with the  confidentiality that was assured for respondents,  reduced our concern that respondents artificially  inflated or disguised their responses. Additionally,  Harman’s one-factor analysis provided evidence  against the presence of one common factor. Com-  mon method bias would also have produced con-  sistent effects of the same variables on both com-  ponents of absorptive capacity, yet we found  different effects of several variables on potential  and realized absorptive capacity. Second, although  the results presented here confirm the majority of  1010 DecemberAcademy of Management Journal  the hypotheses, the study is to some degree explor-  atory. New scales were developed for inherently  difficult-to-measure constructs such as the dimen-  sions of absorptive capacity. Although we con-  ducted additional analyses to assess the validity of  our measures, it would be useful to further enhance  these measurements and develop more elaborate  scales. In future studies, researchers may also try to  measure dimensions of absorptive capacity using  objective measures and relate these to our mea-  sures. Third, our survey research was conducted at  multiple organizational units within branches of a  large financial services firm. Such a focus helped to  account for corporate-, industry- and country-spe-  cific differences that might have otherwise masked  significant effects. Empirical studies in a wider va-  riety of organizations within different industries  are necessary to further generalize the findings.  Fourth, the data employed in this study were cross-  sectional. Although our results are consistent with  the theoretical predictions, further longitudinal re-  search should empirically establish the causal  claim of our model.  Directions for Future Research  The present study provides several issues for fu-  ture research. Future research may incorporate ad-  ditional antecedents of potential and realized ab-  sorptive capacity such as organizational form (Van  Den Bosch et al., 1999), incentive systems, and  dimensions of external linkages of organizational  units. Future studies may also incorporate multiple  levels of analysis and examine individual-level as  well as organization-level variables (Van Den  Bosch, Van Wijk, & Volberda, 2003). Furthermore,  investigating combined or moderating effects of or-  ganizational antecedents (Siggelkow, 2002) would  further enhanceunderstandingof howorganization-  al units manage levels of potential and realized  absorptive capacity. Particular combinations of or-  ganizational mechanisms, for instance, may even  enhance all dimensions of absorptive capacity. Ac-  cordingly, future research may investigate how  such contextual ambidextrous units combine con-  tradictory elements (cf. Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004)  and increase their levels of both potential and re-  alized absorptive capacities simultaneously.  To better explain the effectiveness of potential  and realized absorptive capacity, future studies  might investigate what kind of balance between  potential and realized absorptive capacity leads to  superior performance. With the moderating effects  of environmental dynamism in mind, we would  expect that units with baseline levels of realized  absorptive capacity and high levels of potential  absorptive capacity obtain above-normal perfor-  mance in dynamic markets. It would be useful to  include various consequences such as strategic  flexibility, innovativeness, and first-mover advan-  tages (Volberda, 1998; Zahra & George, 2002) as  well as environmental moderators such as compet-  itiveness and market growth. Examining various  consequences and moderating effects would en-  hance understanding of how certain (relative) lev-  els of potential and realized absorptive capacities  may contribute to achieving and sustaining com-  petitive advantages.  Future studies might also address the role of  knowledge attributes. For instance, Subramaniam  and Venkatraman (2001) found that a higher degree  of tacitness of newly acquired knowledge requires  richer information-processing mechanisms such as  cross-functional teams, frequent communication,  and experienced members.  In conclusion, studying potential and realized  absorptive capacity offers intriguing insights for  both researchers and practitioners. We acknowl-  edge that absorptive capacity is a multifaceted con-  struct and provide new insights regarding how  units may develop important sources of sustainable  competitive advantages.

MANAGING ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION IN  THE EMERGING MULTIMEDIA COMPLEX  MICHIEL DE BOER  Gemini Consulting  FRANS A. J. VAN DEN BOSCH  HENK W. VOLBERDA  Erasmus University, Rotterdam  ABSTRACT  Due to technological convergence, complexes of interrelated industries are  emerging. This paper presents a conceptual framework of the role di erent  organizational forms and combinative capabilities play in the management of  organizational knowledge integration in this context. The focus is on firms  previously operating in one of the relatively stable constituting industries. We  argue that a firm’s organizational form has to be matched with appropriate  combinative capabilities in order to integrate component knowledge into architec-  tural knowledge that consequently serves as a platform for generating new  product–market combinations. The framework is empirically illustrated using the  example of two Dutch publishing firms moving into the multimedia complex,  which is currently emerging around information and communication technologies.  The empirical analysis shows that the framework o ers strong potential for  improving the understanding of the complex process of organizational knowledge  integration, as the prerequisite for developing new business in an emerging indus-  trial complex.  INTRODUCTION  The fundamental transitions that are currently taking place in a variety of indus-  tries are imposing new strains on businesses around the world (Bettis and Hitt,  1995). Consequently, both managers and researchers are searching for new  management paradigms. This paper focuses on the emergence of a complex of  interrelated industries, which is a highly relevant, but at the same time neglected  subject in management research (Prahalad and Hamel, 1994). We examine the  consequences an emerging industrial complex has for firms previously operating in  one of the relatively stable constituting industries.

An important characteristic of an emerging industrial complex (EIC) is the  convergence of di erent technologies into hybrid forms. The implication of this  phenomenon is that the boundaries of previously distinct and relatively indepen-  dent industries are blurring (Astley, 1985; Van de Ven, 1993). A way to recognize  this in quantitative terms is, for instance, the assessment of inter-industry flows of  R&D spendings (Scherer, 1982). Prominent examples of industrial complexes are  the ones emerging around micro-electronics and biotechnology (Lundgren, 1991;  Van Tulder and Junne, 1988).  On the level of the individual firm, the emergence of an industrial complex  implies that opportunities for new business development will grow. Moreover,  already existing but previously alien assets and skills are likely to become necessary  ingredients to exploit these opportunities successfully (Pennings and Harianto,  1992). Hence, the characteristics of this special case of economic and technological  development ask for a renewed perspective on the managerial process that is  considered to be appropriate for firms willing to survive. Still, the understanding of  this challenge to renew is relatively underdeveloped and, accordingly, deserves  more attention.  We take the position that the management of organizational renewal in the  context of an emerging industrial complex should to a large extent be aimed at  creating new architectural knowledge, which is a matter of reconfiguring existing  component knowledge. This interpretation of organizational knowledge reconfi-  guration basically goes back to the seminal definition by Schumpeter (1934, p. 68)  of innovation as ‘the carrying out of new combinations’, or in other words, ‘the  di erent employment of the economic system’s existing supplies of productive  means’. Furthermore, it builds on the distinction by Henderson and Clark (1990)  between four types of innovations, namely incremental, modular, architectural and  radical. As stated by the authors: ‘The essence of an architectural innovation is the  reconfiguration of an established system to link together existing components in a  new way’ (p. 12). This implies that architectural innovations have a more signifi-  cant impact on the relationships between components than on the technologies of  the components themselves. It is clear that this interpretation closely resembles  Schumpeter’s definition of innovation as a process of combining existing supplies  of productive means in new ways. Moreover, it very well matches the context of  an emerging industrial complex, in which for many firms the opportunities to  combine the complex’s existing technologies are more appealing than the opportu-  nities to change the technology itself.  In this paper the term component knowledge is defined as knowledge already  existing somewhere within the original industries constituting an industrial  complex, but often unknown to firms stemming from other industries. The term  architectural knowledge is defined as the innovation a firm creates by combining, or  integrating di erent types of component knowledge into a new configuration. This  architectural knowledge consequently serves as a platform for generating product–  market combinations (PMCs) that need to provide a firm with a favourable return  on its initial investments. The following assumption sums up the challenge of  organizational renewal:  Assumption 1: Managing organizational renewal within an emerging industrial  complex is a process of integrating existing component knowledge into new  # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1999  DE BOER, VAN DEN BOSCH AND VOLBERDA380  architectural knowledge that serves as a platform for carrying out new  product–market combinations.  ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION  The challenge to create new architectural knowledge as described above implies  that the integration of di erent types of component knowledge becomes the key  capability for a firm’s management to master. The notion of the firm as a bundle  of knowledge collections has recently attracted much interest. The emergence of  this stream of literature to a large extent is the result of the popularity of the  resource-based view of the firm (cf. Wernerfelt, 1984) and the related dynamic  capability approach (cf. Teece et al., 1997). In addition, the growing literature on  organizational knowledge also is an indication of the changes in the way organiza-  tions are being interpreted as economic units. This interpretation is moving away  from a production-centred perspective, towards a learning-centred perspective.  The latter implies that human capital in the form of knowledge, skills, and compe-  tences carried by employees and teams, rather than physical and financial capital,  form a decisive basis for the interpretation of an organization’s productivity and  e ectiveness (Nordhaug, 1993; Winch and Schneider, 1993).  In the literature on organizational knowledge a wide range of dimensions is used  to characterize di erent types of knowledge (cf. Winter, 1987). The most widely  used dimension is probably the one running from tacit to explicit (cf. Nonaka,  1994), which is based on the important work by Polanyi (1958, 1966). In this  paper, however, the focus is on a related dimension of the knowledge concept that  matches the concept of architectural knowledge as discussed above, namely its  hierarchy of integration (Grant, 1996). Organizational knowledge is treated at  di erent levels of integration, which can be seen as an elaboration of knowledge  distinctions that simply focus on di erent levels of analysis (cf. Hedlund, 1994;  Kogut and Zander, 1992). The crucial extension is the explicit recognition of the  compound structure of the di erent levels. Another important aspect of this  hierarchy of integration is that it is not necessarily the same as the hierarchy of  authority in an organization, although there must be some degree of correspon-  dence in order to operate e ectively.  At the very bottom of the knowledge hierarchy lies personal knowledge, while at  the very top lies architectural knowledge. The purpose of the multi-level integra-  tion process is to create architectural knowledge that is firm-specific. This  resembles the ideas developed under labels such as distinctive capabilities, core  competences, strategic assets, etc. (cf. Amit and Schoemaker, 1993; Prahalad and  Hamel, 1990; Rumelt, 1984). More and more it is recognized that the resource  characteristic that really can provide a firm with a unique position is its interrelat-  edness to other resources. Nordhaug (1993) in this respect talks about competence  networks and competence configurations, while Leonard-Barton (1995) defines a  core capability as an interrelated, interdependent knowledge system.  For reasons of analytical simplicity, the multilevel integration process is reduced  to two levels. At the bottom of the knowledge hierarchy lie three types of  component knowledge, namely knowledge related to products (or services),  production processes and markets. At the top lies architectural knowledge. In line  MANAGING ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION 381  # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1999  with Grant (1996), the knowledge integration process is characterized using three  dimensions. These three dimensions are e ciency, scope and flexibility. E ciency  of knowledge integration refers to the way in which the architectural knowledge  accesses and utilizes component knowledge. Scope of knowledge integration refers  to the breadth of component knowledge the architectural knowledge draws upon.  Flexibility of knowledge integration, finally, refers to the extent to which the archi-  tectural knowledge can access additional component knowledge and integrate  existing component knowledge.  Using the idea of the knowledge hierarchy, a conceptual framework can now be  constructed of the organizational knowledge integration process. This framework  is outlined in figure 1. Borrowing the concepts of capacity, requirement, and fit  from the information processing perspective as presented by Galbraith (1973,  1977) and Tushman and Nadler (1978), the framework should be interpreted as  follows. The industrial context in which a firm operates determines the type of  integration process which is required. This implies that it is a firm’s challenge to  match this requirement. In order to do so, a firm has two important design  variables at its disposal, namely its organizational form and its combinative capabilities.  Together, the organizational form and the combination capabilities generate a  firm’s knowledge integration capacity. Preferably, this capacity matches the  knowledge integration requirement generated by the stage of industrial develop-  ment the firm is faced with (i.e. the emergence of an industrial complex). Below,  the di erent aspects of the integration process are further elaborated on.  Organizational Forms  The conceptual framework distinguishes various organizational forms as design  variables of knowledge integration. In this connection, an organizational form is  viewed as the infrastructure which in a specific way enables the process of  integrating knowledge. Since each organizational form is di erent, each form is  expected to o er potential for di erent aspects of the knowledge integration  process. In other words, the choice of organizational form has important implica-  tions for a firm’s ability to generate the type of knowledge integration process  required by the context. To illustrate this we limit ourselves to four basic organi-  zational forms, which primarily describe the firm’s internal state. These are the  Fit  Figure 1. The conceptual framework of organizational knowledge integration  # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1999  DE BOER, VAN DEN BOSCH AND VOLBERDA382  functional, division, matrix and innovative forms (Anso  and Brandenburg,  1971).  Recently, a number of attempts have been made to come up with new types of  organizational forms. Examples are the internal network form (Miles and Snow,  1986), the spherical form (Miles and Snow, 1994), the N-form (Hedlund, 1994),  and the hypertext form (Nonaka, 1994). Most of these new types of organizational  form have, however, not yet been explored in su cient detail to assess their  properties regarding the above mentioned three dimensions of knowledge integra-  tion. Still, the conceptual framework is in principle suited to incorporate these new  organizational forms as well.  The four selected organizational forms can be roughly determined by analysing  the way of grouping of activities, the number of hierarchical levels (not to be  confused with the knowledge hierarchy), and the extent to which management is  divided into various functional areas, which is commonly depicted by the organi-  zation chart (Volberda, 1998). In line with the three dimensions of knowledge  integration mentioned above, we compare these basic organizational forms in  terms of their potential for the e ciency, scope, and flexibility of the knowledge  integration process.  Functional form. The functional form is based on a functional grouping of similar  activities under major functional managers, a hierarchy of authority consisting of  many hierarchical levels with small spans of control, and a degree of functionali-  zation of management which may be limited (no sta  functions) or high (sta   functions with formal authority). The principal advantage of the functional form  is its e ciency attained from economies of scale, overheads and skills. The scope  and flexibility of knowledge integration of the functional form is rather limited.  Only in stable and homogeneous environments where there are few PMCs with  a relatively long life cycle, might this form be appropriate (Krijnen, 1979). In  more unstable conditions, conflicts of priorities occur, decisions and products  begin to queue up, communication lines get longer, and time responsiveness to  external conditions is degraded (Anso  and Brandenburg, 1971).  Assumption 2: The functional form has a high potential for e ciency, but a low  potential for both scope and flexibility of knowledge integration.  Division form. The division form is based on grouping by product–market combi-  nations, a limited hierarchy of authority consisting of few hierarchical levels with  large spans of control, and a limited functionalization of management in the  form of some central sta  functions. Because of the autonomy of divisions in  terms of operational decisions and their direct contacts with the environment, the  flexibility of knowledge integration is higher than the functional form. None the  less, to this increase of flexibility of knowledge integration, economies of scale  have to be sacrificed. Furthermore, the scope of knowledge integration is limited  to a single division. The loose coupling among divisions facilitates divisional  knowledge integration, but suppresses integration of knowledge between multiple  divisions. Therefore, a division form is most appropriate in a dynamic environ-  ment with a large number of di erent groups of PMCs that have few characteris-  tics in common and of which the life cycle is relatively long.  MANAGING ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION 383  # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1999  Assumption 3: The division form has a low potential for both scope and e -  ciency, but a high potential for flexibility of knowledge integration.  Matrix form. The matrix form is based on a dual grouping of activities, a dual  hierarchy of authority consisting of few hierarchical levels, and a high degree of  functionalization of management tasks. The matrix is a combination of the  principle of specialized functional departments with the principle of self-su cient,  more or less autonomous units or divisions, in situations where a number of  (temporary) divisions or autonomous units need to be created. The ability of  each unit to seek the organizational form most appropriate to the project it is  handling facilitates the variety and flexibility of knowledge integration. The fact  that available means and persons can be allocated to various projects enables a  high scope and flexibility of knowledge integration. However, as Child (1984,  p. 103) pointed out with regard to the matrix form: ‘A purely structural design will  not of itself guarantee any desired pattern of behaviour’. Still, on account of its  high scope and flexibility of knowledge integration, the matrix form is deemed  appropriate for organizations that function in environments with many new PMCs  with relatively short life cycles. None the less, the scope and flexibility of  knowledge integration of the matrix form is detrimental to its e ciency.  Economies of scale will be rather small because di erent functions, experts and  tools will be needed in di erent simultaneously executed projects, which results in  only partly occupied resources.  Assumption 4: The matrix form has a low potential for e ciency, but a high  potential for both scope and flexibility of knowledge integration.  Innovative form. Anso  and Brandenburg (1971) suggest this as a fourth basic orga-  nizational form which negates some of the disadvantages of the matrix. The  matrix is not applicable in a large majority of manufacturing firms in which  economies of scale are important, assets and competences are relatively inflexible,  and products have long lives. The underlying principle of the innovative form is,  therefore, to gather currently profitable, established product markets into a  current business group and to place development of new product–market  positions into a team-based innovation group. Thus, the innovation group  focuses on increasing the scope and flexibility of knowledge integration, while the  current business exploits its e ciency of knowledge integration. The innovative  organizational form possesses a high potential for scope and flexibility of  knowledge integration and has a satisfactory level of e ciency of knowledge  integration. The degree of e ciency depends on the scale on which operations  take place and on whether the new PMCs are transferred to a new or an existing  division.  Assumption 5: The innovative form has a high potential for e ciency, scope and  flexibility of knowledge integration.  In each of the four basic organizational forms, knowledge is divided and integrated  in a certain way (Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967). In the functional form, component  knowledge is specialized according to functional areas, while in the division form  # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1999  DE BOER, VAN DEN BOSCH AND VOLBERDA384  component knowledge is integrated in semi-autonomous divisions. The matrix  form tries to specialize knowledge in functional areas, but also to integrate  knowledge in project teams. Finally, the innovative form separates component  knowledge from the standard operating core.  The assumptions regarding the potential for knowledge integration of the four  basic organizational forms are summarized in table I. None the less, we have to  look at our classification in perspective. For instance, the potential scope of the  knowledge integration process o ered by a certain organizational form can be  exploited by the use of temporary task forces, standing committees, project teams,  or various other liaison devices that overlay the basic organizational structure  (Galbraith, 1973; Mintzberg, 1979). Of course, there are many other intermediate  forms. Therefore, we consider various combinative capabilities to actively exploit  the potential of the organizational knowledge integration process o ered by the  various organizational forms.  Combinative Capabilities  As indicated, the idea behind the concept of combinative capabilities is that it is  the integration of knowledge, rather than the knowledge itself that forms the basis  of a firm’s competitive advantage. The particular configuration of knowledge  functions as a portfolio of options, or platforms (Kogut, 1991), on future develop-  ments such as new product–market combinations. These platforms are built  through a firm’s combinative capability to synthesize and apply current and  acquired knowledge (Kogut and Zander, 1992).  Clearly, the use of the term combination of Kogut and Zander runs parallel to  the term integration used by Grant (1996), and the term configuration used by  Henderson and Clark (1990). What is neglected in most publications, however, is  a specification of the di erent combination or integration mechanisms a firm has  at its disposal and the impact these are likely to have on the outcome of the  knowledge integration process. Therefore, in our framework we suggest three  types of combinative capabilities, which can be both of an intra and interorganiza-  tional nature. In other words, a firm developing new architectural knowledge can  use these three capabilities to integrate component knowledge located within its  own organization, or component knowledge located within actors operating in its  environment. Systems capabilities enable the creation of new architectural  knowledge through formal systems such as codes, plans and procedures. Co-  Table I.

Sociali-  zation capabilities, finally, enable the creation of new architectural knowledge  through cultural institutions such as values and norms.  Systems capabilities. Often systems capabilities, in terms of directions, policies,  procedures and manuals, are used to integrate explicit knowledge bases. Nonaka  (1994) calls this combination. Individuals exchange and combine explicit knowledge  through formal exchange mechanisms such a priori procedures, formal language,  codes, working manuals, information systems, etc. The reconfiguration of existing  information through these ex ante designed information processing systems can  lead to new architectural knowledge. Grant (1996) argues that the more complex  an activity, the greater the number of locations in which that activity must be  replicated, and the more stringent the performance specifications for the outcome  of that activity, then the greater is the reliance on knowledge integration by  systems capabilities.  While the e ciency of knowledge integration by systems capabilities is very  high, the scope and especially flexibility of knowledge integration are less satisfac-  tory. Systems capabilities describe the degree to which behaviours are  programmed in advance of their execution (Galbraith, 1973; Khandwalla, 1977).  It reflects the degree to which rules, procedures, instructions, and communications  are laid down in written documents or formal systems. The primary virtue of  systems capabilities is that they eliminate the need for further communication and  co-ordination among subunits and positions. Consequently, they provide a  memory for handling routine situations. In such routine situations, the behaviour  of participants is predictable, that is, they know what to do, and they can react  very quickly.  Assumption 6: Systems capabilities have a high potential for e ciency, but a low  potential for both scope and flexibility of knowledge integration.  Co-ordination capabilities. While systems capabilities integrate knowledge by ex ante  rules and procedures, co-ordination capabilities enhance knowledge integration  by relations between members of a group. It refers to lateral ways of co-ordina-  tion which might be explicitly designed, but may also emerge out of a process of  interaction (De Leeuw and Volberda, 1996). In this situation there is not a  separate information processing system, but knowledge integration is produced by  a specific bundle of relations between members of a group. Co-ordination  capabilities accumulate in a firm as a result of training and job-rotation, natural  liaison devices and participation.  An organization can achieve indirect knowledge integration by hiring educated  professionals who can be further trained in the organization. Education and  training achieve indirectly what rules and procedures as a part of systems capabil-  ities do directly. They control and co-ordinate knowledge in the firm. On the job,  professional or craft workers appear to be acting autonomously, but in fact they  are guided by trained skills and acquired knowledge. In addition, in a very  turbulent environment, mutual adjustment becomes the favoured means of  knowledge co-ordination. This brings us to liaison devices for regulating mutual  # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1999  DE BOER, VAN DEN BOSCH AND VOLBERDA386  adjustments between individuals or units. Such liaison devices result in lateral  forms of communications and joint decision-making processes that cut across lines  of authority. Consequently, liaison devices decentralize knowledge integration  without creating self-contained units. The e ect is that the capacity to process  information and to co-ordinate knowledge is increased (Galbraith, 1973).  Finally, in situations in which delegation is a necessity, participation in decision  making can supply the knowledge integration to o set the di erentiation that  delegation causes (Khandwalla, 1977). Participation describes the extent to which  subordinates take part in the decision making of superiors. Low levels of participa-  tion therefore result in poor knowledge integration, because there is little sharing  of information. A high degree of participation results in a more global and rich  knowledge architecture, based on various contributions of lower levels. To  conclude, while co-ordination capabilities are less e cient and more costly than  systems capabilities, the scope and the flexibility of knowledge integration is much  higher.  Assumption 7: Co-ordination capabilities have a low potential for e ciency, but a  high potential for both scope and flexibility of knowledge integration.  Socialization capabilities. In addition to the direct integration of knowledge by rules  and procedures and the indirect integration of knowledge by training, liaison  devices and participation, we distinguish a third type of combinative capabilities.  Socialization capabilities may integrate knowledge components by specifying  broad, tacitly understood rules for appropriate action under unspecified contin-  gencies (Camerer and Vepsalainen, 1988). These capabilities refer to the ability  of the firm to produce a shared ideology that o ers members an attractive  identity as well as convincing interpretations of reality. In this perspective, sociali-  zation capabilities result from the firm’s culture in terms of a system of ideas, or  ‘inferred ideational codes lying behind the realm of observable events’ (Keesing,  1974, quoted in Allaire and Firsirotu, 1984, p. 197). The infusion of beliefs and  values into an organization takes place over time, and produces a distinct  identity for its participants, colouring as it does all aspects of organizational life,  and giving it a social integration that goes far beyond the systems and co-ordina-  tion capabilities discussed above.  Camerer and Vepsalainen (1988) argue that the e ciency of knowledge integra-  tion of socialization capabilities is very high. However, they have serious doubts  about the scope and flexibility of knowledge integration. Socialization capabilities  can create mental prisons that hamper seeing important changes, for instance in  the market (De Leeuw and Volberda, 1996). Moreover, strong cultures usually  su er from xenophobia (Ouchi, 1981) – that is, they resist deviance, retard  attempts at change, and tend to foster inbreeding. Socialization capabilities rest in  firms with a strong identity, in which one can find a coherent set of beliefs, highly  shared values, a common language, and a strongly agreed-upon kind of appro-  priate behaviour. In addition, every member identifies strongly with, and professes  loyalty to, the goal of preserving, extending, or perfecting the organization’s  mission, and so can be trusted to make decisions in the organization’s interests.  Such a situation leaves little room for integrating knowledge in ways which contra-  dict shared beliefs.  MANAGING ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION 387  # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1999  Assumption 8: Socialization capabilities have a high potential for e ciency, but a  low potential for both scope and flexibility of knowledge integration.  The assumptions regarding the potential for knowledge integration of the di erent  types of combinative capabilities are summarized in table II.  Stages of Industrial Development  In order to compare the knowledge integration capacity generated by the organi-  zational form and combinative capabilities with the knowledge integration require-  ment generated by the industrial context, the implications of the change firms  undergo when moving from the relatively stable context of a single mature  industry towards the turbulent context of an emerging industrial complex need to  be further specified. As indicated in the introduction, an important characteristic  of an emerging industrial complex is technological convergence, which causes the  blurring of industry boundaries and the rise of opportunities to combine existing  component knowledge into new architectural knowledge. These notions can be  combined with the literature on product, industry and technological life cycles (cf.  Dosi, 1982; Tushman and Anderson, 1986; Utterback and Abernathy, 1975). In  the early development phases standardization is low, uncertainty is high, and  competition is on di erentiation, rather than on costs (cf. Porter, 1980; Van den  Bosch and De Man, 1997). This leads us to conclude that the type of architectural  knowledge that is required in an emerging industrial complex should score high  on both scope and flexibility of knowledge integration. At the same time, e ciency  of knowledge integration, which is dominant in the context of a mature single  industry (MSI), becomes of minor importance.  Assumption 9: In a mature single industry the dominant requirement of the  knowledge integration process is e ciency.  Assumption 10: In an emerging industrial complex the dominant requirements of  the knowledge integration process are scope and flexibility.  The assumptions regarding the knowledge integration requirement of the di erent  stages of industrial development focused on in this paper are summarized in table  Table II.

It should be clear that assumptions regarding other types of (changes in)  contexts can be formulated in a similar manner.  PROPOSITIONS  Now that theoretical assumptions regarding the knowledge integration capacity  and requirement have been discussed, the next step is to combine these two in the  form of a number of tentative propositions that can be used to illustrate the  empirical appropriateness of the conceptual framework. So, propositions are to be  formulated regarding the knowledge integration capacity of a firm’s organizational  form and combinative capabilities on the one hand, and the type of knowledge  integration requirement of the industrial context on the other hand. In other  words, the propositions regarding a firm moving from a context requiring  e ciency (stage 1) to a context requiring scope and flexibility (stage 2) of the  knowledge integration process can be logically deducted when combining tables I,  II and III.  Proposition 1: Firms operating in a mature single industry generally need to  employ a functional form, and either systems or socialization capabilities in  order to generate the required knowledge integration capacity.  Proposition 2: Firms operating in an emerging industrial complex generally need  to employ either a matrix or innovative form, and co-ordination capabilities in  order to generate the required knowledge integration capacity.  THE EMERGING MULTIMEDIA COMPLEX  The example of publishing firms moving into the currently emerging multimedia  complex is used as an illustration of the appropriateness of the conceptual  framework presented above. The multimedia complex is chosen as an empirical  example because it is right at the heart of the evolutionary process in which  technologies stemming from various industries are converging into hybrid forms.

An early overview of this new competitive landscape is  provided by McLaughlin and Biriny (1984). More recent contributions include  Aksoy (1992) and Hagel and Eisenmann (1994). In this context, traditional  publishers are typical examples of firms having to reconsider their new business  development strategies. Besides existing and still flourishing media such as books,  newspapers and journals, information delivery can now also occur through a  range of new electronic and optical media such as on-line databases, Internet,  CD-ROM, CD-i, and audiotex. A remarkable characteristic of these new media  types is that their initial development took place ‘beyond the bounds of the tradi-  tional publisher’s strategic heartland’ (Kist, 1987, p. 4). Hence, publishers provide  a prototype of firms moving from a mature single industry, to an emerging indus-  trial complex in which existing but alien component knowledge merges with native  component knowledge.  To illustrate our conceptual framework, we examined a number of Dutch  publishing firms with a strong background in folio publishing. Our examination  took place in the midst of the change from a mature single industry to an  emerging industrial complex; 1996 is chosen as the year in which this change took  place. The case studies of two of these firms are presented below. Within these two  firms semi-structured interviews were held and internal documents were studied to  create a longitudinal picture of their organizational knowledge integration process  from the early 1980s to mid 1997. The reason for choosing this period is that it  covers the transformation of both firms from a predominantly folio business to a  hybrid business of both folio and new media. With some witticism, this transforma-  tion can be labelled with the wordplay mediamorphosis. The specific type of new  architectural knowledge focused on by the firms was medium-neutral database  management, which is a prerequisite for so-called publishing on demand. This  means that the firms were developing the ability to deliver information to its  customers exactly in the amount, format, medium, moment, etc. they desire. The  types of component knowledge that needed to be integrated in this respect are a  specification of the basic types of component knowledge previously described.  Knowledge related to the enrichment of information content (i.e. product  knowledge), knowledge related to the process of information gathering, processing,  refining, updating, storing, and distributing (i.e. production process knowledge),  and knowledge related to the anticipation, interpretation, understanding, and  stimulation of customers’ need for information (i.e. market knowledge).  Het Financieele Dagblad  Het Financieele Dagblad (HFD) is a publisher of mainly Dutch financial and  business information. HFD has a long history in publishing, going back to 1796.  Today, HFD holds a special position in the Dutch publishing industry. The  company is not listed at the stock exchange, and has managed to withstand the  wave of mergers and acquisitions during the last couple of decades. Despite a wide  range of take-over candidates, HFD’s bicentennial anniversary in 1996 was still  celebrated in independence. In 1997, HFD had about 160 employees, which  makes it a relatively small player. Still, within the market for financial and business  information, HFD holds a very strong position. Its newspaper is the only one of its  kind and has a solid subscription base.  # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1999  DE BOER, VAN DEN BOSCH AND VOLBERDA390  HFD’s most important product has always been and still is the financial  newspaper, which is comparable to the British Financial Times and the German  Handelsblatt. It is the leading financial and business publication in the Netherlands.  Besides the newspaper, HFD nowadays is involved in a wide range of other infor-  mation and communication activities as well. An important element of HFD’s  strategy to develop a mixed media portfolio was its database with the electronic  archives of a number of existing folio products, of which the newspaper is the  most important part.  HFD started the exploration of the opportunities for database information in  1982. During the development of the database, HFD has clearly evoked changes  to its organizational form and combinative capabilities. In stage 1, HFD showed  the functional form. There was a division between the editorial, prepress, and  marketing activities. This o ered the appropriate structure to create the required  e ciency capacity, as suggested by proposition 1.  In 1996 HFD introduced a new organizational structure, which resembled the  innovative form. Part of the new structure was a separate and independent new  business development unit which since then became responsible for electronic  products such as the database, as well as other activities, such as organizing  congresses. The major benefit of the new business development department was  the bundled expertise and the focused attention. Because of this stronger internal  position, the new business development department also became better equipped  to deal with external partners. The change in stage 2 towards the innovative  organizational form, which is suggested by proposition 2, had a positive e ect on  both the speed and the focus of the development process.  Regarding the combinative capabilities the following changes occurred. In stage  1, HFD employed few so-called hard mechanisms such as formal planning,  budgeting, procedures, etc. Neither the hierarchical structure nor the promotion  policy was very stringent, for example. The same applied to the new business  development activities, which were fairly unstructured. Partly, this was due to the  traditional routines that ruled the publishing industry in general. There simply  was no inclination within HFD to do things di erently. Besides, the company was  so unfamiliar with new media that one simply did not know what and how to  plan, budget, control, etc. Instead, the firm clearly showed a strong reliance on  socialization capabilities. Because of its long history, HFD has had a long time to  develop a strong corporate culture on which to rely its functionalized operations.  This was especially the case with the editorial sta  department (journalists and  editors), which was considered to form the core of the firm’s existence. Overall,  the firm’s use of combinative capabilities appeared to be in accordance with  proposition 1.  A considerable and complex product, such as the database has become since  then, now requires a much more formalized approach than it has seen so far.  HFD is increasingly using systems capabilities to evaluate the new business devel-  opment activities. Another implication of HFD’s choice to bundle the new  business development activities in a semi-independent unit is the need for  extensive communication and knowledge exchange between the di erent depart-  ments. Project management is a suitable management instrument in this respect. A  project team brings together people with di erent functional backgrounds, which  encourages the integration of di erent knowledge components. During stage 1,  MANAGING ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION 391  # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1999  however, project management was not used due to lack of clear external objec-  tives. In stage 2, and especially with regard to the exploration of new business  opportunities, HFD started using project teams consisting of people from new  business development, marketing, and the editorial sta . Altogether, the use of co-  ordination capabilities in stage 2 was suggested by proposition 2, while the use of  systems capabilities was not. HFD’s overall deployment of combinative capabilities  is summarized in table IV.  Samson H D Tjeenk Willink  Samsom H D Tjeenk Willink (SHDTW) was one of the many business units of the  Dutch publishing conglomerate Wolters Kluwer. (Early in 1998, SHDTW merged  with one of Wolters Kluwer’s other business units.) The roots of SHDTW lie in  the production and trade of o ce products. In 1882, Nicolaas Samsom, municipal  secretary and tax collector, handily took advantage of his experience and started a  private business in municipal administrative systems and forms. Today, SHDTW  still publishes information primarily for the government. Because of space restric-  tions, the description of the process of mediamorphosis at SHDTW is limited to a  typical mixed media project, namely a reference guide containing educational  information. In the past, the reference guide was solely published as a loose-leaf  folio product. During the last couple of years, however, loose-leaf issues in general  have been hit by a declining circulation, indicating this medium is reaching the  end of its product life-cycle. Hence, there is a ubiquitous need for publishers to  search for new ways to exploit their information. Electronic media o er strong  potential in this respect.  The road towards an electronic guide was long and thorny. In 1985, a first  attempt was made to computerize the data files of the guide. It was only in the  summer of 1996, however, that the database became operational. The first supple-  ment to the folio issue of the guide deducted from the database was produced by  the end of 1996. The first electronic product finally was introduced on the market  in the summer of 1997.  An important reason why it took so long for SHDTW to develop the database  and new media product was the di culty it had in changing its organizational  knowledge configuration. In stage 1, SHDTW showed a strong division between  semi-independent publishing groups focusing on a clear set of product–market  combinations. This structure reflected the division form, which was not suggested  Table IV.

Still, SHDTW’s division form in stage 1 can be explained in the  light of the great number of PMCs compared to HFD. When the context  changed, however, SHDTW did not change its organizational form. Hence, in  stage 2 SHDTW managed to develop the required flexibility capacity, but did not  develop the required scope capacity.  Regarding the combinative capabilities the following occurred. In stage 1,  SHDTW clearly showed a strong reliance on socialization capabilities. The use of  these strong routines aimed at traditional folio publishing is in accordance with  proposition 1. Although in stage 2 SHDTW deployed co-ordination capabilities,  such as project teams, to increase its scope and flexibility capacity, it proved to be  problematic to overcome its old socialization capabilities. Hence, while the use of  co-ordination capabilities is in line with proposition 2, the perseverance of the old  socialization capabilities inhibited the development of the required knowledge  integration capacity. SHDTW’s overall deployment of combinative capabilities is  summarised in table V.  DISCUSSION  The changes that HFD and SHDTW experienced in their organizational form  and combinative capabilities can now be discussed in terms of the conceptual  framework. Figure 2 shows the way in which HFD’s knowledge integration  capacity as well as the knowledge integration requirement of its environment have  changed over time. Figure 3 shows the situation for SHDTW.  The first stages in figures 2 and 3 indicate that, prior to the emerging multi-  media complex, especially HFD showed a strong fit with its environment. The  second stage in figure 2 shows that the emergence of the multimedia complex, and  the change in the knowledge integration requirement this has created, has largely  been matched by HFD’s internal changes. The company has learned how to deal  with its changing environment by choosing an appropriate organizational reconfi-  guration. On the other hand, the second stage in figure 3 shows that SHDTW has  not (yet) learned how to deal with its changing environment.  Altogether, the investigation of the two publishing firms showed a moderate to  strong plausibility of our assumptions and propositions. The empirical analysis,  Table V.

An interesting point not suggested by our framework is that HFD’s  use of systems capabilities in stage 2 did not seem to frustrate the knowledge  integration process. On the contrary, in our analysis of HFD the use of systems  capabilities indirectly enabled the required integration of HFD’s product, produc-  tion process, and market knowledge. The benefit of the use of clear and strict  directions for knowledge integration, as revealed in the investigation of HFD, is  that it can facilitate the process of breaking down the old socialization capabilities.  Having a relatively long and stable history in folio publishing, new media did  not fit comfortably or closely into the established frameworks and concepts of the  two publishing firms. Instead, HFD and SHDTW were entering uncharted terri-  Notes:  E = e ciency; S = scope; F = flexibility; H = high; L = low  Organizational form: F= functional form; D = division form; M = matrix form; I = innovative form  Combinative capabilities: Sy = systems capabilities; C = co-ordination capabilities; So = socialization capabilities  Stage of industrial development: MSI = mature single industry; EIC = emerging industrial complex  Figure 2.

Fortunately, the stickiness of HFD’s old socialization capabilities to a large  extent was matched by their customers. Most markets were still far from ready to  be penetrated with new media PMCs. None the less, especially SHDTW encoun-  tered di culty to overcome its old socialization capabilities, which frustrated the  attempts to generate its knowledge integration capacity.  The stickiness of these old socialization capabilities is related to the fact that  publishing has always been a relatively profitable industry, especially regarding  scientific and professional information. This has created a very strong and  succssful culture to please stockholders with ever increasing profits. At the  moment, however, this culture for many firms clearly inhibits the making of the  heavy and uncertain investments that are required to become a publisher on  Notes:  E = e ciency; S = scope; F = flexibility; H = high; L = low  Organizational form: F= functional form; D = division form; M = matrix form; I = innovative form  Combinative capabilities: Sy = systems capabilities; C = co-ordination capabilities; So = socialization capabilities  Stage of industrial development: MSI = mature single industry; EIC = emerging industrial complex  Figure 3.

In fact, a firm which is not faced with the pressure of the stock exchange,  such as HFD, seems to be in the lucky position to have less di culty with this.  On the whole, our empirical analysis provided the opportunities to amend our  initial propositions. Extended research in the emerging multimedia complex is  needed to investigate the plausibility of, among other things, the following new  proposition:  Proposition 3: Firms moving from a mature single industry to an emerging indus-  trial complex generally need to overcome their previous socialization capabil-  ities in order to not frustrate the generation of their integration capacity. Due  to the stickiness of socialization capabilities, this is likely to be a tough and  lengthy process.  CONCLUSION  Today, the emergence of industrial complexes is an important phenomenon that  requires new understanding at various levels of analysis. This paper has addressed  the implications this industry change has for the management of organizational  knowledge integration at the level of the individual firm. A conceptual framework  of organizational knowledge integration was presented and a number of tentative  propositions were formulated accordingly. Although the propositions were not  tested in any great detail, the investigation of two Dutch publishing firms moving  into the emerging multimedia complex illustrated that the conceptual framework  appears to have potential for explaining how di erent types of organizational  forms can be matched with di erent types of combinative capabilities in order to  create the knowledge integration capacity that is required by the industrial  context. None the less, it is clear that the framework is not conclusive and needs to  be further refined, both theoretically and empirically.  First of all, additional as well as more specific propositions have to be developed.  Secondly, the propositions have to be investigated using other types of firms in  other kinds of emerging industrial complexes. The complex emerging around  biotechnology is a worthy suggestion in this respect. A third opportunity for  further research is to extend the conceptual framework. This paper has only  concentrated on the process of creating new architectural knowledge. The equally  important process of using the architectural knowledge as a platform for the  generation of new PMCs has been largely neglected, but deserves attention as well.  Hence, the initial step has been made, but much work still needs to be done so  that enriched understanding of the management of organizational knowledge  integration in an emerging industrial complex ultimately will be useful to various  types of firms operating in such a context.

Volberda, Charles Baden-Fuller and  Frans A. J. van den Bosch  How do large multi-unit firms in a deconstructing world reconcile the conflicting forces  of profits for today and flexibility to adapt for tomorrow? Profits for today requires  order, control, and stability: adaptation for tomorrow requires flexibility and creativity in  the value-added system. Large firms in many industries are confronted with this  challenge of exploration and exploitation. In the European financial services industries  these conflicting tendencies are increasingly obvious. Existing large financial players  seem well placed to exploit the present but ill suited to adapt to the future. Why is  this so, and what can be done about it? We consider the mechanisms of selection,  adaptation and co-evolution that take place between levels within the firm and  between the firm and its environment, and from this identify four ideal kinds of  strategic renewal journeys that organisations can adopt as a way of coping with  increasing environmental pressures. We label these journeys: emergent, directed,  facilitated, and transformational. We show how these ideal types represent different  options for top, middle and front-line managers, and we identify how each type differs  in its capacity to cope with the changing environment. We illustrate our renewal  journeys with examples from Dutch (ING and Rabobank) and British financials (Barclays,  Lloyds and Prudential) and other organisations such as GE, IBM, Intel, Novotel and  Philips. We suggest that for mobilising renewal in well-established financial  institutions—once protected but now exposed to the winds of change—managers have  to recognise that many of the current journeys are unsuitable for the future.  c 2001  Elsevier Science Ltd.

Mastering Strategic Renewal160  respond and learn at the same time as promoting order and con-  trol among their units? In many industries there are powerful  forces towards change—such as the arrival of new technologies,  new competition, and globalisation—which necessitate explo-  ration. On the other hand there are short-term competitive  forces demanding stability, such as the need to exploit what the  organisation has and avoid risky unproven projects.  These conflicting forces are clearly evident in European finan-  cial services industries. The industry is globalising with a con-  verging of incumbent players (such as banks and insurance  companies) and new entrants, particularly telecommunications  firms and large retailers. Most large well-established financial  firms recognise that strategic action is required on all fronts.  Considering the changing landscape of the financial services sec-  tor,1 the need for strategic renewal is higher than ever before.  This paper describes four idealised journeys of renewal, which  managers in multi-unit firms can use as a guide to their thinking.  Two of these journeys are clearly associated with what many  banks are doing today, and two represent more clearly possible  patterns for tomorrow. The “ideals for tomorrow” have already  been adopted by leading-edge organisations in other fast-moving  turbulent environments such as silicon chip making. For each  journey, we will define the appropriate managerial roles, specify  the knowledge design, and elaborate on the pacing of renewal in  terms of risk, speed, and competitive positioning. We also show  the intellectual and organisational antecedents for each journey,  and with this analysis give insight into the rationale behind suc-  cessful journey selection.  Rethinking strategic renewal: a co-evolutionary  perspective  Strategic renewal can be broadly defined as the activities a firm  undertakes to alter its path dependence. Important parameters  of a journey of renewal include: the behaviour of managers at  each level of the organisation in response to each other (top-  down or bottom-up); the way they view investing for tomorrow  versus milking profits today (exploration versus exploitation);  and the way in which they share knowledge with each other  across organisation boundaries (intra-organisation learning).  Until now managerial theories on renewal consider either a  purely selective or adaptive perspective.2 Selection perspectives  view renewal as highly restricted by resource scarcity, conver-  gence to industry norms, and structural inertia. In other words,  the strategic activities of successful firms are very similar and  limited to strengthening and exploiting their existing core com-  petencies. By contrast, adaptation perspectives suggest that firms  can and do change, overcoming their rigidities. That is, successful  firms learn to behave differently and explore new competencies.  In this paper, we investigate journeys of strategic renewal of  multi-unit firms by considering environmental selection jointly  with managerial adaptation, viewing strategic renewal as an ongo-  ing journey instead of a discrete shift from one state to another.  Combining several degrees of selection and adaptation allows us  to develop a coherent managerial framework of four idealised  renewal journeys, and, in doing so, to provide answers to the  following questions:    When is renewal a selection and/or an adaptation process?    What roles do managers at the corporate and unit level play  in these renewal journeys?    How do these roles fit with the environment and the need to  respond to turbulence?    What are the benefits and risks of each ideal type?  In this paper, we consider the renewal path of units (and hence  the whole firm) that depend on the interactions between top  management and front-line or business unit managers. We look  at three levels of analysis in the journeys of renewal—the environ-  ment, the headquarters or top management of the multi-unit firm,  and the front-line or business unit managers—and at how they  co-evolve on the journey. Using March’s idea of exploration-  exploitation as a metric for progress, we see strategic renewal  journeys as multi-level co-evolutionary processes taking place  over time and leading to adaptations designed to align com-  petencies with the environment and increase competitive advan-  tage.  For academic readers, we summarise the basis for our thinking  in Table 1. For the selection journeys, we mention the key contri-  butions of population ecology, institutional theory, evolutionary  theory and the resource-based view. On the side of adaptation  we mention dynamic capability theory, behavioural and learning  theories, and theories of strategic choice.3  We move beyond simple adaptation-selection debates to sug-  gest that there is scope for more pluralism. Instead of focusing  on naı̈ve selection or pure adaptation processes, we consider the  joint outcomes of managerial adaptation and environmental selec-  tion, viewing adaptation and selection not as wholly opposed  forces but essentially interrelated as if opposite poles of a con-  tinuum. Our approach draws heavily on the ideas of co-evolution  that are now gaining ground in the academic literature, but have  not yet made their way sufficiently into managerial practice. This  co-evolutionary approach stresses the possibility of multiple  paths, the central idea of this paper.  We identify four ideal renewal journeys, labelling them Emerg-  ent, Directed, Facilitated, and Transformational. Each ideal jour-  ney can be related to the academic ideas of selection, adaptation  and co-evolution. Each is relevant to the multi-unit firms, but  offers different approaches to managing the interactions between  the front-line and top management, and between the overall firm  and its environment.

We go some way to connect managerial  action with the important concepts of variation, selection and  adaptation. By doing this, we scope out a more rigorous  approach to the managerial renewal agenda. The key aspects of  these four ideal types—sources of variation, locus of unit selec-  tion, exploitation/exploration balance, knowledge design, and  competitive positioning—are summarised in Table 2.  The emergent renewal journey: follow the  market  The ideal emergent journey of renewal is rooted in the assump-  tion that some managers believe that they should be essentially  outwardly orientated or passive, their role being to amplify mar-  ket forces and market signals for the benefit of the unit managers.  For example, top managers set their business units’ targets based  on profits, rather than internal processes such as speed of new  Table 2. Idealised Renewal Journeys of Multi-Unit Firms.

The emergent journey is the consequence of this reactive mar-  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 163  Effective co-ordination  does not easily take  place without active  management  Mastering Strategic Renewal164  ket approach to variation, selection and retention. Regarding  variation, typically top managers do not encourage unit man-  agers to engage in extensive search for new ideas and new busi-  ness models: rather they stress the risks of straying outside the  competence boundaries. If variation is required, top manage-  ment undertakes this task by purchasing units from other organ-  isations or from the capital market. ING’s acquisition of Barings  Bank matches this behaviour. The top management perceived a  market opportunity to purchase a good quality organisation for  a nominal sum. According to top management, such a move did  not come from below, but rather from entrepreneurial behaviour  at their level. At the lower levels, many of the units within ING  during the early 1990s were conservative with respect to inno-  vation—unit managers being more concerned with today than  tomorrow.  Expansion and contraction of existing businesses (called selec-  tion and adaptation) are undertaken in a similar spirit that is  essentially outward looking or market-orientated. Units will be  selected “in” or “out” by a process that is typically profit-driven:  those that cannot yield a return above a benchmark are sold or  closed. Barclays’ behaviour during the 1990s is indicative of an  emergent renewal journey. In the last decade, it shed thousands  of jobs, scaled down its investment banking activities, and  avoided splurging on risks.5 Barclays is accompanied by many  other UK banks that have shifted their focus from viewing branches  as a collective asset, and now assess each branch on a stand-alone  basis, closing branches that do not meet profits targets.  Most large firms face pressures to create synergies between  units. In the emergent journey, the behaviour of top manage-  ment is typically paradoxical. For example, in the UK in the late  1980s many banks took over estate agents, and there were press-  ures for house sales agents to be involved in selling add-on fin-  ancial services. Yet top management did not fundamentally alter  the organisations’ processes or remuneration measurement sys-  tems to make the synergies happen faster, and instead let units  organise the synergies in an organic fashion. As a result, most  firms found that despite profit-related incentives, the hoped-for  synergies did not materialise. This is no surprise to management  scholars, who have long argued that effective co-ordination  across functional and organisational boundaries does not easily  take place without active management.6 Such intervention goes  against the outward-looking philosophy, top management typi-  cally believing that managerial intervention will degenerate into  managerial meddling and disruption.  Where is creativity in this journey? Of course front-line man-  agers will be brimming with ideas, but they are encouraged to  think within the business. If they create new units these are typi-  cally sold rather than developed. However top managers see  themselves as entrepreneurs who are free to range over a wide  territory. They are often active in the market for acquisitions and  sales (as mentioned above) and, taking a trader’s attitude, they  typically buy and sell elements of their portfolio in reaction to  or anticipation of market trends. They may buy-in units that are  in the early stages of development. Long-run success depends on  an active market for new units, which is more common in Anglo-  Saxon than traditional European or emerging economies.  The emergent journey has low administrative costs,7 and is  common among many high-performing conglomerates in stable  mature environments. Units often perform very well in the short  term, selecting carefully among their capabilities to achieve maxi-  mal returns. Failure has clear sanctions: when a division or unit  is “selected-out”, it is closed, sold, or finds its resources with-  drawn. ICI, the UK chemical giant, has recently been following  this philosophy in the way it has reshaped its portfolio of busi-  nesses.  The emergent journey is usually defended in terms of its suit-  ability to dealing with mature slow-moving environments, with  little evidence of synergies between units that cannot be done  through the market. The benefit of the emergent approach is in  avoiding the myopia of being wedded to particular ideas or  notions; a trap that mature firms can fall into even in mature  environments. Historically many financial service firms such as  Barclays and ING have adopted this approach when the industry  was stable: it is doubtful if this journey is so suited to volatile  environments where there is a need to build synergies.  The directed renewal journey: top management  should be in control  In directed renewal journeys, top managers believe they have  some power over their environment and that strategy making in  large complex firms involves multiple levels of management in  a more co-evolutionary manner. In this perspective, renewal  journeys are driven by a priori managerial intentions cascading  down. A key role for top management is to provide the purpose  or strategic intent in guiding journeys of renewal of multi-unit  firms. As a result of top-down strategy making, multi-unit firms  make their strategy changes deliberately, adapting to changes in  their competitive environment, with top management explicitly  managing the balance of exploration and exploitation by bring-  ing in new competencies to some units while utilising well-  developed competencies in others.  The directed renewal journey model assumes that the multi-  unit firm is purposeful and adaptive. Top management sets goals,  scans the environments, searches for alternatives, chooses one,  and monitors the process. In this ongoing sequence, “strategy  formulation” precedes “strategy implementation”, with ideally,  management in the role of a “rational actor” issuing directives.  It requires an exhaustive analysis before action is taken, and that  management holds a considerable amount of power and has  access to complete information. For successful implementation,  management must orchestrate local rejuvenation, diffusion  among units and push units towards goal achievement.  This directive approach of top management fits with the pre-  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 165  Top management  argues that careful  co-ordination is vital  Mastering Strategic Renewal166  scriptions of classical administrative theorists8 It also matches the  perspective of Prahalad and Hamel,9 who argue that strategic  renewal depends on the strategic intent of the CEO or corporate  management and should be based on superior industry foresight.  O’Dell and Grayson10 point out that with these situations, senior  management has to commit resources to make things happen,  and to become actively involved in the process: they cite Chevron  and Rank Xerox, both associated with a hierarchical style, and  the typically tightly controlled multinational also falls into this  category.  Directed journeys of renewal have been very evident in  recently privatised utilities in Europe. Top management typically  hires outside consultants to fulfil their responsibility of teaching  the multi-unit firm the new competitive rules set by the industry  regulator. There is little opportunity for middle management to  learn, as they have to conform to new rules rather than create  them.11 During the first half of the 1990s, Rabobank fits this  journey. Top management in this co-operative bank group  orchestrated organisational change processes that enabled knowl-  edge-integration among loosely coupled units. Top management  deliberately aimed at becoming a completely customer-driven  organisation. The period of Lloyds/TSB under Sir Brian Pitman  also resembles the ideal-type directed renewal journey. His  industry foresight resulted in Lloyds/TSB growing from the  smallest of the UK clearing banks into the most successful and  profitable financial player in the UK. His influence was so strong  that Lloyds’ managers were prone to make decisions on what  they thought Pitman might think, instead of relying on their  own judgement.12  Directed renewal typically results in interference in the way  units are structured, and the way they allocate resources intern-  ally. Top management may have a preferred organisation design  (such as the matrix) and a capital allocation rule (x% to new  products, y% to improving processes). Top management typi-  cally argues that highly integrated firms need direction and hier-  archy for regulation of internal change and that careful co-ordi-  nation is vital to avoid different units going off in different  directions. The risk of “paralysis by analysis” is always present,  making this journey difficult in dynamic, rapidly changing  environments. Directed renewal appears to be particularly suited  to firms experiencing steady growth or decline, where the bene-  fits of hierarchy in terms of formal planning and control can be  fully realised.  All of the above suggests that directed journeys of renewal are  less suitable for organisations facing permanent turbulence,  where boundaries between markets and units are being broken  down. Although such directed trajectories can be very speedy,  they often cannot cope with the diversity of knowledge required  for variation, adaptation and selection and for the pressures of  integration.  These first two ideals represent journeys that have been typical  in the traditional managerial history of European financial ser-  vices firms, fitting in easily with the established managerial mind-  set and experience of top management in this environment. Our  third and fourth journeys are much less common in mature  environments, and represent significant challenges to traditional  management thinking. What to do in situations when following  the market is not enough or top management is not in control?  Such more hypercompetitive landscapes require front-line and  middle management to take a more active stand. They are more  complex, co-evolutionary and subtle approaches to management.  The facilitated renewal journey: increase variety  of renewal initiatives  In the facilitated renewal journey lower levels of management  are active in the choices for and mechanics of renewal. Top man-  agement’s role is to create a strategic context for nurturing and  selecting promising renewal initiatives by ensuring the maximum  incentives for front-line initiative. The logic of this journey is  that front-line managers have the most current knowledge and  expertise and are closer to the routines and sources of infor-  mation critical to innovative outcomes, and that top manage-  ment can act as retrospective legitimiser13 or judge and arbiter in  support of lower-level initiatives. Compared with the emergent  journey, in this type of renewal journey multi-unit firms are  likely to show a more balanced portfolio of units in terms of  exploitation units and exploration units (see Table 2).  In the facilitated renewal journey, top management moves  away from having profits targets and market share as being the  sole objectives for measurement, and takes a more balanced  internal–external perspective adding factors such as the fre-  quency of new product and service introduction, and the oper-  ation of goals such as the share of revenues from new ideas. In  addition, top management may intervene in guiding the struc-  ture of units, suggesting or directing forms of organising. The  establishment of the branchless Prudential bank in 1995 was  organised along the lines of this journey. This bank was built by  the people who were going to run it. Because of the desire for  flexibility, planning was done step by step instead of following  a masterplan. The co-involvement of the future managers and  employees, and the project’s “no-blame” and forward-looking  culture helped ensure its success.14  Another well-documented example of facilitated renewal jour-  neys where top management encourages selecting out and lower  management handles new unit creation can be found in Burgel-  man’s study15 of the reshaping of Intel’s business in the 1980s.  He shows that it was not the corporate strategy but the “internal  selection environment” that caused a shift from memory chips  towards the microprocessor business. He conjectures that the  higher the correspondence between the internal selection criteria  (that is set by the top management) and external selection press-  ures (how the industry segments are evolving and how tech-  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 167  These organisations  appear to be in a  perpetual state of  adaptation  Mastering Strategic Renewal168  nology is changing), the better the selection mechanism guaran-  tees the co-evolution of a multi-unit firm’s competencies with  the sources of competitive advantage of the industry.  In facilitated renewal journeys top managers look for variety  generators to facilitate venture creation, which parallels or antici-  pates older more mature activities being dropped. At the simplest  level, we can think of isolating a flexible unit from the rigid  operating core. This principle was applied at Citibank’s Kallithea  branch in Greece, also called the “banking laboratory” by Citi-  bank executives. This branch was used to develop the US bank’s  world-wide consumer operations, and has pioneered new elec-  tronic services such as 24-hour telephone banking and paperless  deposits and withdrawals.16 IBM also isolated a unit when the  IBM PC was developed, as the mainframe logic was strongly pre-  served in IBM’s culture and prevented entry into the new PC  market. While at first IBM was very successful with this isolation  strategy, it found that transferring these new capabilities from  the flexible mode to the rigid operating core was very difficult.  IBM could not exploit these capabilities in its operating core  because it lacked communication channels and common mental  frames. Similarly, Eastman Kodak, Philips, and Xerox have had  only modest success from their internal venturing and new busi-  ness development programs.  Stronger variety generators involve the continuous splitting of  groups into separate units. Hewlett Packard, Johnson & Johnson,  and Origin are examples of firms that have developed mech-  anisms to set up new units. This encourages entrepreneurs to  pursue their ideas in separate divisions, while the older, more  established units provide continuity and stability. Overall, these  organisations appear to be in a perpetual stage of adaptation,  never really rigid or planned as long as new units are being regu-  larly created from within. Their internal selection mechanisms  (e.g., 70 per cent of HP’s sales have to be represented by products  introduced or substantially modified in the past two years) bring  costs, such as the difficulty of integrating the new ideas back into  the old organisation. But they also bring some benefits, as new  ideas are typically insulated from the inertia of the centre, and  have the possibility to flourish without being suffocated.  In comparison with emergent renewal, facilitated renewal  journeys allow much more potential for learning across the firm’s  units. Yet the thinness of the top management group and the  lack of significant resources devoted to moving knowledge can  make intra-corporate learning more limited than in other jour-  neys. While the facilitated journey is far more difficult for top  management to handle, it has the potential to yield far greater  results when the environment is turbulent and there is a need  for co-ordination between units. Teece et al.17 argue that organis-  ations driven by strong internal selection are typically narrowly  diversified and can operate effectively in rapidly moving tra-  jectories, as technological inter-dependence encourages units  into knowledge sharing without the need for direction from top  management. However, top management’s lack of direct control  over the organisation makes it difficult for the multi-unit firm  to engage in any large-scale developments that require central  co-ordination or synergy across units. Facilitated renewal is  therefore appropriate in highly complex and dynamic markets  where deliberate strategy of any kind becomes difficult.  The transformational renewal journey: mobilise a  company-wide renewal process  In the transformational renewal journey, top management still  believes that it can influence the environment, but also believes  in working closely with the lower levels. Involvement of front-  line managers is seen as essential to the renewal process, and, in  this sense, the journey can be described as holistic, with a close  link between collective cognitions and the process of strategic  renewal.18 The question of what drives renewal thus depends on  the socially constructed reality of organisational participants, a  reality defined through collective sense-making in which percep-  tions are affirmed, modified, or replaced according to their  apparent congruence with the perceptions of others and other  levels. Weick19 described this sense making as enactment, mem-  bers of organisations actively forming or enacting their environ-  ment through their social interaction. A pattern of enactment  establishes the foundation of the firm’s organised reality, which  in turn shapes future enactments. Renewal in this perspective is  driven by the development of shared strategic schemas or collec-  tive frames of reference.20 However, such shared strategic  schemas are difficult to change and may delay necessary renewal  in strategy, leading to decreased performance or even failure.  Calori and Baden-Fuller21 described in some detail the change  processes at Novotel, one of the largest hotel chains in the world.  This organisation had clearly followed the transformational path  in the way it had managed renewal. The processes were led from  the top, but involved very considerable involvement from all lev-  els, not just to participate in the changes, but also to shape the  direction of the process. This involvement improved the quality  of the result and increased the speed of the process.  Transformational renewal journeys are associated with sig-  nificant unlearning, new ways of thinking and new mindsets, dif-  ferent paths of technology, and particular kinds of corporate  entrepreneurship. Corporate entrepreneurship literature suggests  this journey is a holistic exercise that eventually involves the  whole business: requiring systemic rather than piecemeal changes  in the multi-unit firm. This change may cascade through the  organisation, and it is quite clear that organisations can move in  cycles between one extreme (exploitation) to the other  (exploration), with periods of systemic exploration when the  organisation is renewing and changing its skills and com-  petencies.22 This renewal journey therefore is likely to be charac-  terised by an imbalance between exploration and exploitation  (see Table 2).  The journey of transformational renewal is transparent when  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 169  Mastering Strategic Renewal170  applied to the small unit, especially the start-up. There, a single  entrepreneur is seen as the driving force of the innovation pro-  cess imbuing a spirit into the whole enterprise, collecting and  motivating like-minded individuals. The lack of tight commit-  ments and relatively low sunk costs enable these units to under-  take radical change easily.  Recently, considerable attention has been paid to the success-  ful regeneration of mature units, or whole complex organis-  ations, especially those in a crisis or facing decline. Here the  literature has generally pointed to the existence of a chief execu-  tive, or team that has championed renewal. Kotter and Heskett23  provide a discussion of systemic change processes in British Air-  ways and other organisations. Also, Whittington et al.24 found  in a European panel study those large firms able to realise sys-  temic and complementary changes enjoyed high performance.  In these cases, it is clear that the top management team is led  by a chief executive who is much more than an administrator;  he or she is a transformational leader who drives the process  from the front but involves others and brings them along too  (see Table 2). Transformational renewal demands that the whole  organisation must be involved if radical change encompassing  new technologies and new processes is to be accomplished. For  the multi-unit firm this journey is quite different from directed  renewal. Besides transformational leadership, it emphasises the  importance of the middle manager as an entrepreneur who con-  nects the various levels of the organisation. This is not the case  of one level driving another, but of team-working among levels  and functions.25 Collective sense-making is an important require-  ment for knowledge integration processes as highlighted by Non-  aka and Takeuchi26 and Grant,27 and is a key component of the  integrative processes that seek to maximise organisation learning.  Transformational renewal journeys are often associated with  narrowly defined technological trajectories, for example, large  multinational firms, where all the divisions are in a closely related  business and the environment is evolutionary but punctuated by  occasional radical shifts. In such cases the importance of intra-  organisation learning is often high (transmitting best practice  from one country to another). When occasional radical shifts are  necessary, the firm can rise to the challenge.  Changing the firm’s destiny: development  journeys of financial firms  Our four journeys of renewal differ fundamentally, each implying  a different solution to the tensions between top, middle and  front-line management. Each journey is based on different theor-  etical assumptions about the source of variation (market, co-  evolution, hierarchy, collective sense making), the locus of unit  selection (external selection, internal selection, top management  intentions, shared schemas), the mix of exploration and exploi-  tation activities (balanced, unbalanced), the level of knowledge  integration (less-connected to tightly-coupled units) and com-  petitive positioning (following to changing industry rules).  Although these are ideal journeys—“pure” examples of the typi-  cal components of a specific type of each journey—understand-  ing their structures and implications and appreciating the differ-  ences between them can be a potent source of understanding for  managers of firms in the real world, whose journey of renewal  may be hybrid forms of two or more of the ideals. This is illus-  trated in the CEO commentary on strategic renewal at Rabobank  in this issue. Another reason why firms may be hard to categorise  is that they may move through different periods, each character-  ised by a different renewal journey. Such meta or development  journeys of renewal form part of the portfolio of strategic choice.  Consider GE’s corporate revitalisation guided by its CEO Jack  Welch, Philips’ corporate change initiated by Jan Timmer and  further accelerated by Cor Boonstra, or Novotel’s renewal led by  Pellison. The starting point of these companies seemed to be a  period of stasis where both top and front-line managers had been  passive and where the financial community was threatening to  impose market selection. New CEOs arrived and pushed directed  renewal. Typically they began with a process of competence  development led by the CEO, which introduced new concepts,  communicated them in an understandable manner through the  use of metaphors and analogies, and reiterated them repeatedly.  Consequently, new capabilities such as speed, simplicity, and  market responsiveness were passed down the organisation almost  as an order or instruction to be followed. Following these periods  of top-down directed renewal, the organisations have moved on  to another period, where top management shows more trans-  formational leadership and other management levels are involved  in order to create system-wide change (transformational  renewal). Finally, top management becomes more of an orches-  trator, facilitating decentralised entrepreneurship, and the jour-  ney is more like that of facilitated renewal.  As was pointed out earlier, for many financial service firms  inertia prevents the renewal journey being altered in a funda-  mental manner. Although firms cannot make such transitions  very often, we argue that it is indeed possible. We already  described that the Dutch Rabobank Group followed a directed  renewal journey in the first half of the 1990s. Top management  aimed to orchestrate the integration of organisational knowledge.  The organisational units were not very tightly connected. As the  Rabobank Group grew in size due to acquisitions, such as the  co-operative insurer Interpolis in 1990, it came to resemble a  large centralised organisation. Organisational units began to  complain that the corporate centre, Rabobank Nederland,  became too powerful by imposing its product-driven strategies  upon organisational units such as the local banks. In the second  half of the 1990s, Rabobank Group tried to change its renewal  journey towards transformational renewal (see Table 3). In 1996,  the predecessor of the present CEO pointed out:  The hierarchical, pyramidal structure, with its tendency to  uniformity, belongs to the past.… Traditional organisation  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 171  Firms may move  through different  periods, each  characterised by a  different renewal  journey  Mastering Strategic Renewal172  Table 3.

Owing to the  distribution of knowledge it has become impossible and  unnecessary to manage organisations from the top….  Hence, it is better to think in terms of the network concept.  The organisation as a system of relations between people,  who collectively want to realise a shared idea.28  This transformational renewal was further accelerated through  the corporate-wide decision-making process to revitalise the co-  operative foundation of the Rabobank which resulted in a new  ambition statement and strategic orientation in 1999. According  to Rabobank’s Annual Report of 1999, a top priority was the  creation of synergy between the organisational units, and a more  decentralised management approach resulting in a reduction of  the size of the corporate centre. Furthermore, it was decided that  the network character aimed at in the new ambition statement,  was better captured by the new name “Rabobank Group” instead  of the previous name “Rabobank organisation”.  ING also altered its dominant renewal journey during the last  decade, from merely emergent towards a facilitated renewal jour-  ney (see Table 3). Due to large-scale merger and acquisition pro-  cesses, ING emerged in the beginning of 1990s as an all-finance  corporation consisting of a collection of unconnected divisions  (Postbank, ING Bank, Nationale Nederlanden) each subject to its  own external market forces. ING’s top management only stressed  financial performance criteria and did not actively redesign its  multiple divisions. During that period ING clearly followed the  emergent renewal journey. However, during the second half of  the last decade and in particular in 1999 and 2000, top manage-  ment took a much more active attitude in creating an internal  selection environment reflecting external market forces (quasi-  selection) and the managers of the organisational units had a  more active role in terms of stimulating knowledge integration  among formerly loosely connected units. At present ING’s  renewal journey is in transition from emergent renewal towards  facilitated renewal. This renewal journey is rather exceptional  compared with most of the major European banks. Citibank is  one of the few large international incumbents that operates in  this mode. As Kelly and Allison29 pointed out in their effort to  use complexity science to explain the developments of Citibank:  “Everyone at Citibank talked of the externally focused competi-  tive atmosphere, which had internally emerged from the people  and their patterns of interaction.” Furthermore, they observed  co-evolution at micro- and macro-levels and both a clear stra-  tegic intent and room for exploration at the unit level within  Citibank.  Summary and discussion  Organisations are not static, and often resist attempts at simple  categorisation. While journeys of renewal in practice are highly  idiosyncratic, we used idealised models of journeys as one of the  approaches to this the problem. These idealised journeys com-  partmentalise phenomena of renewal of multi-unit firms into  idealised paths that are simple enough for managerial, organis-  ational and knowledge attributes to apply. In particular, we have  posed four basic journeys: market selection pressures propelling  emergent renewal journeys, management intentions pushing  directed renewal journeys, deliberate variety generation and  internal selection driving facilitated renewal journeys, and collec-  tive sense-making allowing transformational renewal journeys.  We discussed each of these four journeys in terms of theoretical  differences regarding management intentionality, source of vari-  ation, locus of unit selection, the exploitation/exploration bal-  ance, knowledge design and competitive positioning (see Table  2). Based on this assessment we discussed why and how firms  move between renewal journeys over time (see Table 3).  Journeys of the future  Is one of these idealised journeys more successful than the other  journeys of renewal? The emergent renewal journey represents an  extreme, where top management amplifies market pressures,  often enforcing more rigorous standards than would otherwise  be imposed. There is no doubt that for substantial periods of  time, financial firms have done very well by adopting such  emergent journeys.  In contrast, in transformational renewal where the front-line  managers are working most intensely with top managers, learn-  ing is intense and diversity among levels and groups leads to  learning, exploration and rejuvenation. Here, top management  sees its role as overcoming market forces of selection, forcing  fast-track adaptive and learning behaviour. As a development  model it sounds ideal, but the resulting path appears to have  drawbacks. We suggest it is poor at dealing with technological  discontinuities and the journey may not sustain over time,  because of the supreme effort required for all the parties  involved.

On the other hand, scholars specialised in complexity theory30  provide valuable evidence that facilitated renewal may be very  effective, and could dominate the future landscape. Renewal pro-  ceeds most rapidly, they argue, when top management effects  small probes in a characteristic rhythm, recombining the port-  folio of units, so that novelty is deliberately generated without  destroying the best elements of past experience. Top manage-  ment operates on unit managers indirectly, taking advantage of  the tendency for myriad local interactions to self-organise into  a coherent pattern. Rather than shaping the pattern that consti-  tutes strategic renewal (directed renewal), managers shape the  context within which it emerges, speeding up co-evolutionary  processes.  New empirical research in the financial services industry  For the academic researcher, our paper has important pointers.  Are all journeys viable or do some dominate? One reason for  our caution is the paucity of good empirical work. Cross-  sectional survey-based studies and economic time series model-  ling dominate by far the empirical research landscape.2 Until  now, there have been few very long-run analyses, yet they often  yield surprising results.31 We clearly need more long-term studies  of how industries and firms co-evolve and emerge over very long  periods of time where several of the journeys of renewal can be  compared, not just two at a time.32 Moreover, large-scale longi-  tudinal international research programmes such as NOFIA (New  Organisation Forms in the Information Age) or INNFORM  (Innovative Forms of Organising in the 21st century) may be  helpful vehicles to create data sources for studying journeys of  strategic renewal.33  In this issue’s collection of papers on renewal in Financial Ser-  vices we take a multi-country approach. Most of the existing  research on renewal however takes a single country perspective.  In this issue, we answer if and how financial institutions change  in a European context where there is governmental and regulat-  ory influence as well as changing technology and consumer pref-  erences. Our approach is simultaneously longitudinal and cross-  sectional. The cross-sectional nature is captured by our examin-  ation of banks and insurance companies in many European  countries: France, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK.  These will be examined historically and contemporaneously giv-  ing a longitudinal perspective.  Broadening managerial choice  Finally, our journeys point to important lessons for practising  managers and those who teach them. By setting up the bench-  mark of “selection” where managers are seen as passive actors  driven by path dependency, we point out that there are real  choices that managers can make, explicitly or implicitly. These  choices include four different ideal journeys for renewing the  multi-unit firm. Each of these is distinctive from the others in  having different benefits and costs. Each choice may differ in  efficacy according to environmental stimuli, and each implies  differences in roles for top and front-line management. We offer  potential insights into some of the consequences of these choices:  by doing so, we hope to help managers in mastering strategic  renewal and mobilising change.  References  1. B. Flier, F.

WINTER 2012   MIT SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW   17  International relocations of entire corpo-  rate headquarters are a rare phenomenon.   But the relocation of elements of headquar-  ters — such as the offices of top management   team members, core functions like finance,   R&D or shared services — is happening   more and more, triggered by the increasing   internationalization of markets and indus-  tries. At present, international relocations   of corporate headquarters elements can   most clearly be observed — as a kind of   early warning — in highly international-  ized, small, open economies, such as   Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands, that   traditionally host a relatively high number   of multinationals’ corporate headquarters.   However, multinationals currently hosted   in larger countries are also affected by in-  creasing levels of internationalization.  The international oil services group   Halliburton Co. offers an example. In 2007,   the globalization of Halliburton’s markets   and industry led Halliburton to shift its   business focus from the United States to the   Middle East. The desire to be close to its   major global customers — national oil   companies in the Eastern Hemisphere —   and the oil industry’s center of gravity (the   Eastern Hemisphere accounts for three-  quarters of proven fossil fuel reserves) drove   the decision to relocate Halliburton’s CEO   from headquarters in Houston to Dubai in   the United Arab Emirates. Other elements   of the headquarters remained in Houston.  We researched corporate headquarters   decisions of the 100 largest multinational   corporations headquartered in the Neth-  erlands, which has one of the world’s most   internationalized economies, making it an   excellent country in which to investigate   this trend. Fifty-eight Dutch multination-  als participated in our survey, including   Fortune Global 500 corporations such as   Royal Dutch Shell, ING Group, Royal   Philips Electronics, Unilever and Hei-  neken. Our survey results indicate that   57% of the participating multinationals   have already internationally relocated ele-  ments of their headquarters. Furthermore,   67% intend to start or to continue relocat-  ing within the next five years.   The research on which this article is   based was both qualitative and quantitative.   First, we interviewed top management team   members from 10 of the 100 largest Dutch   multinational corporations; the interviews   helped us to create an in-depth and fine-  grained understanding of top management   [GLOBAL BUSINESS]  Should Top Management Relocate   Across National Borders?  In today’s increasingly international world, it’s not uncommon for multinational   companies to move some element of their headquarters to another country. Here’s   how to evaluate the strategic costs and benefits of such decisions.  BY MARC G. BAAIJ, TOM J.M. MOM, FRANS A.J. VAN DEN BOSCH AND HENK W.

We then gathered   and analyzed quantitative data by means of   a questionnaire and fact sheets. We invited   the CEO and other top management team   members of the 100 largest multinational   corporations headquartered in the Nether-  lands to participate in the quantitative   research, and we received complete data for   58 companies. To test for nonresponse bias   we examined differences between respon-  dent companies and nonrespondent   companies in terms of sales volume, indus-  try and level of internationalization; no   significant differences appeared, indicating   that nonresponse bias may not be a prob-  lem. To avoid issues of single informant   data, the questionnaire was filled out not   only by the CEO of each of the companies   but also by the top management team mem-  bers of four functional areas.   Assessing the Strategic Ben-  efits and Costs of Relocation  Despite the growing practice of interna-  tionally relocating top executives, our   research shows that relocating top man-  agement team members abroad resulted in   higher performance for only about half of   the corporations responding to our survey.   The reason is that such relocations — de-  spite their strategic benefits — also entail   strategic costs. (See “The Costs and Bene-  fits of Relocating Executive Offices.”) To   make well-informed decisions, executives   need to understand these benefits and   costs and their interplay.   The benefits of international relocation   of top management team members’ offices   are strategic: better access to knowledge and   improved relationships with stakeholders   abroad, resulting in more effective decision   making. The barriers against international   relocation of such offices include personal   ties, functional interdependencies and fiscal   and legal constraints at the individual, orga-  nizational and country level. These barriers   imply that physical relocation of top man-  agement team members to a new host   country is not always the best option for the   corporation. Fortunately for large corpora-  tions, relocating an entire office is just one of   three possible options: 1) physical relocation   of a top management team member’s office;   2) no office relocation but usage of interna-  tional communications technology and   international travel; or 3) dual offices. The   decision on which of these three options is   best depends on the strength and interplay   of the relocation drivers and barriers. Below   is our explanation of all three options, fol-  lowed by our conclusions about the drivers   and barriers.   Option 1: Relocation of a Top Manage-  ment Team Member’s Office The large   Dutch information services group VNU   (acquired in 2007 by a private equity con-  sortium and renamed The Nielsen Co., now   Nielsen Holdings) provides an illustration   of the relocation of an executive’s office.   VNU expanded into the United States in the   1990s and early 2000s by taking over a num-  ber of U.S. companies, including ACNielsen.   Should Top Management Relocate Across   National Borders? (Continued from page 17)  THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF RELOCATING   EXECUTIVE OFFICES  Relocating top management team members abroad can have strategic costs as well as   benefits — and companies need to understand these benefits and costs and their interplay.

To   get closer to the business, VNU’s Dutch CEO   decided to relocate his office from the Neth-  erlands to the New York headquarters of one   of the acquired companies. Primarily for tax   reasons, VNU’s corporate headquarters and   most of the staff remained at the fiscal seat in   the home country. Because of functional in-  terdependencies, the CEO wanted the CFO,   also a Dutch national, to relocate to New   York too. However, for personal reasons the   CFO was unwilling to expatriate. Although   the CEO and the CFO held long and fre-  quent conference calls to manage functional   interdependencies, often many times a day,   it did not prove to be sufficient or effective.   Eventually, in 2005 the CFO retired and his   successor relocated his office to New York.  Option 2: No Office Relocation but   Extensive Usage of International Com-  munications Technology and Travel Of all   the management levels, top management   team members rely most on soft and tacit in-  formation. Even the most advanced com-  munication tools cannot match the richness   of face-to-face interaction. Therefore, top ex-  ecutives also need to engage in international   travel to visit stakeholders and have face-to-  face meetings. Our respondents report high   amounts of time spent on international travel.   “I spend up to half of my time outside the   home country” was a common refrain.   Option 3: Dual Offices This option means   that the top management team member   maintains an office in the corporation’s   home country, and has a second office in a   host country. The Fortune Global 500 cor-  poration Royal Philips Electronics provides   an example. The path to dual offices began   in 2001, when Royal Philips Electronics ex-  panded through a series of international   acquisitions. At the time, the executive vice   president of the health-care division was lo-  cated in Best, in the Netherlands. But after   the acquisition, the division’s geographic   business focus shifted to the United States.   To manage the trade-off between the strate-  gic benefits of the geographic shift and the   costs — for example, losing executive team   cohesion and effectiveness because of the in-  terdependencies between the health-care   division executive vice president and the   corporate headquarters — in 2006, Philips   decided to establish a second office for the   executive vice president in Andover, Massa-  chusetts, the hub of the division’s overseas   activities. But he still kept his office, with a   small part of the staff, at the corporate head-  quarters in Amsterdam.  In general, physical relocation of top   management team members to a new host   country is not an “all or nothing” issue. In   fact, in a high percentage of cases, full-  fledged office relocation is not the best   option for the corporation. Fortunately,   other options are available, including the   increased usage of communications tech-  nology and international travel, as well as   the operation of dual offices. Only by as-  sessing the drivers of top management   team relocation, and weighing them   against the barriers, can a corporation   make the best decision.   Marc G.

L. Vlaar  Frans A. J. Van den Bosch  Henk W. Volberda  RSM Erasmus University  In this article, the authors discuss the evolution of trust, distrust, and formal  coordination and control in interorganizational relationships. They suggest that  the degrees to which managers trust and distrust their partners during initial  stages of cooperation leave strong imprints on the development of these rela-  tionships in later stages of collaboration. This derives from the impact of trust  and distrust on (a) formal coordination and control, (b) interorganizational per-  formance, and (c) the interpretations that managers attribute to the behavior of  their partners. Collectively, the authors’ arguments give rise to a conceptual  framework that indicates that there is a high propensity for interorganizational  relationships to develop along vicious or virtuous cycles. By integrating and  reconciling previous work on the trust-control nexus and by emphasizing the  dynamics associated with it, the article contributes to a more comprehensive  and refined understanding of the evolution of interorganizational cooperation.  Keywords: trust; distrust; formal coordination; formal control; evolution;  interorganizational relationship  Interorganizational governance issues have attracted growing attentionfrom academics and practitioners, due to an the increasing number of  alliances, outsourcing relationships, and other forms of interfirm exchange  and the significance attributed to governance issues associated with these rela-  tionships (see Gulati & Singh, 1998; Kale, Dyer, & Singh, 2002; McEvily,  Group & Organization  Management  Volume 32 Number 4  August 2007  407-429  © 2007 Sage Publications  10.1177/1059601106294215  http://gom.sagepub.com  hosted at  http://online.sagepub.com  407   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://gom.sagepub.comDownloaded from   Perrone, & Zaheer, 2003a). The corresponding literature distinguishes several  means by which cooperating parties may govern these relationships, primar-  ily emphasizing trust and formalization (Bijlsma-Frankema & Koopman,  2004; García-Canal, Valdés-Llaneza, & Ariño, 2003; Luo, 2002; Poppo &  Zenger, 2002). In line with this, different theoretical perspectives on the sig-  nificance of trust and formalization, and on the interplay between them, have  emerged. In particular, contributions have emphasized (a) that trust and for-  malization may act as substitutes (e.g., Das & Teng, 2001; Dyer & Singh,  1998; Gulati, 1995; Inkpen & Currall, 2004; Zaheer & Venkatraman, 1995),  (b) that they may function as complements (e.g., Deakin & Wilkinson, 1998;  K. J. Mayer & Argyres, 2004; Poppo & Zenger, 2002; Sitkin, 1995; Zucker,  1986), (c) that they have a variety of performance effects (e.g., Kern, 1998;  Luo, 2002; K. J. Mayer & Argyres, 2004; Sydow & Windeler, 2003), and (d)  that they may develop along self-reinforcing cycles (e.g., Ghoshal & Moran,  1996; Inkpen & Curall, 2004; Macaulay, 1963; Zand, 1972).  Despite these contributions, the relationships between trust and formal-  ization remain far from clear (Maguire, Philips, & Hardy, 2001; Sydow &  Windeler, 2003), and much theoretical input is still needed to understand how  they work as governance mechanisms (Bachmann, 2001). In particular, the  roles of trust and formalization in the process of relationship development  and their evolution during cooperative endeavors deserve more attention   (De Wever, Martens, & Vandenbempt, 2005; Ferrin, Bligh, & Kohles, this  issue; Inkpen & Currall, 2004). In line with this, calls have been issued for  more integrative approaches toward theory development and more dynamic  representations of the trust-control nexus (Bijlsma-Frankema & Costa, 2005;  Bijlsma-Frankema & Koopman, 2004). In this article, we undertake a first  step in this direction by addressing the following research question: How do  trust and formalization evolve in interorganizational relationships?  To investigate this question, we distinguish trust from distrust and formal  coordination from formal control. We then introduce a conceptual framework  in which we incorporate two other variables: interorganizational performance  408 Group & Organization Management  Authors’ Note: This research has benefited from inspirational discussions with Africa Ariño,  Justin Jansen, and Rosalinde Klein Woolthuis.

This framework con-  tributes to the literature in two ways. First, it transcends prior work on interor-  ganizational governance issues through the systematic integration of a range  of contributions on the roles of trust and formalization in interorganizational  relationships and on the interrelationships between them (as advocated by  Bachmann, 2004; Bachmann, Knights, & Sydow, 2001; Bijlsma-Frankema &  Koopman, 2004; McEvily et al., 2003a). Second, by reconciling apparently  inconsistent arguments and empirical evidence on the trust-control nexus  (Bachmann et al., 2001; Bijlsma-Frankema & Costa, 2005), we are able to  describe how interorganizational governance may evolve, something that has  received little attention in the literature thus far (Inkpen & Currall, 2004;  Klein Woolthuis, Hillebrand, & Nooteboom, 2005). We explain why trust and  distrust during initial stages of cooperation leave strong imprints on the  development of collaborative relationships in later stages of development by  elucidating their impact on formal coordination and control, interorganiza-  tional performance, and the interpretations that managers attribute to the  behavior of their partners.  The article proceeds along the following lines. We start by defining the  main constructs in our study. Subsequently, we introduce our conceptual  framework, and we explain how trust, distrust, and formal coordination and  control may evolve during collaborative relationships. We do so by consecu-  tively discussing the effects of trust and distrust on formal coordination and  control, on interorganizational performance, and on managers’ interpretations  of partner behavior. We conclude with a brief summary, the theoretical and  practical implications of our study, and opportunities for further research.  Defining the Main Constructs  In this paragraph, we define the major constructs in our study, starting with  trust. Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, and Camerer (1998) define trust as “a psycho-  logical state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based upon posi-  tive expectations of the intentions or behavior of another” (p. 395). This  definition implies that trust involves choice (Luhmann, 1988) and the exis-  tence of risk (R. Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995). Nooteboom (1999)  explicitly addresses these points in his definition of trust, stating that it “entails  that one does not expect to be harmed by a partner even though she has both  the opportunity and the incentive to be opportunistic” (p. 203). His definition  indicates that trust consists of a subjective state of positive expectations (Das  & Teng, 2001) and that the partner and his or her behavior are the objects of  Vlaar et al. / Interorganizational Relationships 409   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://gom.sagepub.comDownloaded from   trust (Inkpen & Currall, 2004). Accordingly, we follow R. Mayer et al. (1995)  in defining trust as  the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another party  based on the expectation that the other will perform a particular action impor-  tant to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other  party. (p. 712)  Trust encompasses not only the belief in the ability of a partner organiza-  tion to accomplish a task but also the belief in the goodwill or positive  intentions of this partner and the perception that it adheres to acceptable  values (R. Mayer et al., 1995; Serva, Fuller, & Mayer, 2005). Moreover, as  we recognize that individual managers and not organizations as a whole  trust their partners (Dodgson, 1993; Ferrin et al., this issue; Zaheer, McEvily,  & Perrone, 1998), we refer to interorganizational trust in this article, being  “the extent of trust placed in the partner organization by the members of a  focal organization” (Zaheer et al., 1998, p. 142).  Although trust and distrust are sometimes viewed as two ends of a con-  tinuum, several scholars acknowledge that they are separate but related con-  structs (Hardin, 2004; Lewicki, McAllister, & Bies, 1998; Sitkin & Roth,  1993). Following Lewicki et al. (1998), we therefore define distrust as “con-  fident negative expectations regarding another’s conduct” (p. 439) that man-  ifest themselves in fear, vigilance, or suspicion (Sitkin & Roth, 1993).  Distrust thus derives from the negative hypothetical possibility regarding a  partner’s behavior and actions (Bachmann, 2001). It arises when partners  have an interest in behaving opportunistically (Williamson, 1985). We con-  tend that trust and distrust coexist, not only because partners can trust each  other in one respect and distrust each other regarding other issues (Lewicki  et al., 1998) but also because partners may cultivate trust and distrust at the  same time so as to reap the benefits from both and to compensate for the weak-  nesses associated with each of them individually. Trust, for example, always  remains a fragile mechanism (Dodgson, 1993), which prompts Langfred  (2004) to state that “a little skepticism never hurt anyone” (p. 391). This indi-  cates that certain combinations of trust and distrust may be most beneficial to  interorganizational cooperation than others. To conclude, we thus embrace the  idea that trust and distrust coexist (see Miles & Creed, 1995).  Although trust and distrust involve the expectations of managers concern-  ing their partners, formalization involves actual interference in collaborative  endeavors. It consists of the codification and enforcement of inputs, outcomes,  and interorganizational activities (Bijlsma-Frankema & Costa, 2005; Das &  410 Group & Organization Management   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://gom.sagepub.comDownloaded from   Teng, 2001). The principal exponent of formalization in interorganizational  relationships consists of contractual planning, which refers to the process of  “projecting exchanges into the future” (Macneil, 1980, p. 4) and to the con-  tracts eventuating from this process. According to transaction cost economists  and agency theorists, contracting is primarily aimed at curbing opportunistic  behavior and establishing control over partner organizations. It does so by rais-  ing the costs of self-interested activities, changing payoff structures and incen-  tives, and increasing the transparency of relationships and objects of monitoring  (Oxley, 1997; Williamson, 1985).  However, formalization is not only a means to control, but it also a coor-  dination function, which is gradually receiving more systematic attention in  the literature (e.g., Carson, Madhok, & Wu, 2006; Foss & Foss, 2005; Gulati  & Singh, 1998; Klein Woolthuis et al., 2005; Madhok, 2002; K. J. Mayer &  Argyres, 2004). Although control problems are primarily rooted in differ-  ences in motivation and interest between partners, coordination problems  generally arise from the cognitive limitations of individuals. These problems  may persist even though partner interests may be aligned (Foss & Foss,  2005; Gulati, Lawrence, & Puranam, 2005). From a coordination perspec-  tive, contracts may then be interpreted as a means to pursue the alignment of  activities and as technical aids to managing relationships (Klein Woolthuis  et al., 2005). They help partners to decompose tasks and to establish and  communicate activities. This is particularly significant for interorganiza-  tional relationships in which tasks have to be continuously geared to each  other and in which joint decision making between partners is required  (Gulati & Singh, 1998).  As we argue that trust, distrust, and formal coordination and control  affect interorganizational performance and the interpretation that managers  give to their partners’ behavior, we also define these constructs here.  Interorganizational performance concerns both “the degree of accomplish-  ment of the partners’ goals . . . and the extent to which their pattern of inter-  actions is acceptable to the partners” (Ariño, 2003, p. 23). Support for this  stance is provided by De Rond (2003), who found that participants in  alliances between pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms did  assess the performance of their relationships not only on economic or strate-  gic outcomes but primarily on factors such as the ease or smoothness of  cooperation, the extent to which conflicts prevail, and the partners’ satisfac-  tion with coordination and communication processes (see also Luo, 2002;  Poppo & Zenger, 2002). When we discuss interorganizational performance,  we therefore consider the outcomes achieved in a relationship and the rela-  tional quality underlying these outcomes (Ariño, 2003; Ariño, De la Torre, &  Vlaar et al. / Interorganizational Relationships 411   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://gom.sagepub.comDownloaded from   Ring, 2001). Finally, in the context of this article, interpretation is defined as  the meaning that is attributed to a partner’s behavior.  Now that we have defined the main constructs in our study, we elucidate  how trust, distrust, and formal coordination and control may evolve   in interorganizational relationships. We do so by explaining the research  framework depicted in Figure 1. The general thrust of our argument is that  managers’ expectations during initial stages of cooperation—in terms of the  levels of trust and distrust that they hold toward their partners—have a major  impact on the development of these relationships in later stages (see also Doz,  1996; Ferrin, Bligh, & Kohles, 2005; Klein Woolthuis et al., 2005).

These effects increase the likelihood that existing  expectations are reinforced and that trust and distrust develop along vicious  or virtuous cycles.  Trust and Distrust Affecting Formal   Coordination and Control  A large body of literature proposes that trust may act as a substitute for  formal control, as higher degrees of trust reduce the need for control (e.g.,  Das & Teng, 2001; Dyer & Singh, 1998; Gulati, 1995; Inkpen & Currall,  2004; Zaheer & Venkatraman, 1995). From this perspective, trust and for-  mal control consist of “functionally equivalent strategies for absorbing  uncertainty and dealing with the freedom and indeterminacy of other  agents” (Knights, Noble, Vurdubakis, & Willmott, 2001, p. 329; see also  Reed, 2001; Zucker, 1986). Both forms of governance increase the per-  ceived predictability of social actors’ future behaviors (Luhmann, 1979;  Nooteboom, 2002). This implies that if managers lose trust in their part-  ner, more resources have to be invested in formal control (Dyer & Chu,  2003), while increments in trust reduce the need to do so (Inkpen &  Currall, 2004; Zaheer et al., 1998). This substitution effect between trust  and formal control is conditional on the existence of a certain degree of  distrust. After all, if managers do not have any reason to distrust their part-  ner (e.g., the perceived opportunities and payoffs for opportunistic behav-  ior by a partner are low), a lack of trust does not have to be compensated  by an increase in formal control. This leads us to our first proposition (see  also Figure 1).  Proposition 1a: In the presence of distrust, increases in trust reduce the need for for-  mal control, whereas decreases in trust augment the need for formal control.  Trust also exhibits a positive relationship with formalization, in that higher  degrees of trust enable higher levels of formal coordination and control  (Dekker, 2004). Trust facilitates open communication and negotiations on the  details of contracts, “including the thorny sensitive clauses like relationship  termination” (Klein Woolthuis et al., 2005, p. 831). Furthermore, by facilitat-  ing information sharing (Dyer & Chu, 2003; Dyer & Singh, 1998), and   Vlaar et al. / Interorganizational Relationships 413   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://gom.sagepub.comDownloaded from   by functioning as a “lubricant of economic exchange” (Knights et al., 2001,  p. 312), trust enables parties to record aspects of their relationships in formal  contracts and other formal documents. Distrust, instead, entails low degrees  of information exchange and limited opportunities for observing and learning  from partners (Maguire et al., 2001), which reduce their possibilities to for-  malize the relationship. We contend that the enabling character of trust and  the restricting nature of distrust pertain to both formalization’s coordination  function and its control function. After all, communication and information  exchange are conducive to codification and enforcement in general.  Moreover, as the coordination and control functions of formalization are  strongly intertwined, an enabling or restricting influence on one of them will  generally affect the other function as well (Foss & Foss, 2005; Madhok,  2002). This leads us to the following proposition (see also Figure 1).  Proposition 1b: Decreasing levels of distrust and increasing levels of trust augment  the ability of managers to establish formal means of coordination and control.  Performance Effects  In this paragraph, we discuss the performance effects of trust, distrust,  and formal coordination and control featuring most prominently in the  literature.  Basic Levels of Trust and Excessive Levels of Distrust  Basic levels of trust function as a prerequisite for interorganizational coop-  eration because they help to generate and maintain interaction and social  order (Bachmann et al., 2001; Inkpen & Curall, 2004; Luhmann, 1979; Reed,  2001). In particular, “in the face of unknown conditions, unintended conse-  quences, existing zones of uncertainty, and the prevailing dialectic of control,  social interaction always requires some trust” (Sydow & Windeler, 2003,  p. 79). Otherwise, interorganizational relationships would be pervaded by  very high levels of uncertainty, causing managers to continually question the  motives and competences of their partners (Das & Teng, 2001; McEvily   et al., 2003a). In such cases, managers become less willing to take risks, and  they refrain from sharing perspectives and knowledge (Bijlsma-Frankema,  2004; March & Olsen, 1975). Similarly, we contend that excessively high  levels of distrust prohibit beneficial cooperation as well, as potential partners  may become reluctant to initiate relationships or because their relationships  414 Group & Organization Management   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://gom.sagepub.comDownloaded from   are pervaded by so much suspicion that they are not able to capitalize on joint  opportunities for value creation. We capture this in Proposition 2 (see also  Figure 1).  Proposition 2: Very low levels of trust and very high levels of distrust have a nega-  tive effect on interorganizational performance.  Basic and Excessive Levels of Formal   Coordination and Control  Analogue to trust, basic levels of formal coordination and control gener-  ally form a precondition for people to engage in transactions with external  partners as well (Bachmann, 2001; Dasgupta, 1988; Johnson, McMillan, &  Woodruff, 2002; Malhotra & Murnighan, 2002). Irrespective of the level of  trust, certain levels of coordination and control are necessary to endow par-  ticipants in interorganizational relationships with a degree of certainty, sta-  bility, and guidance (Langfred, 2004; Weick, 2001), without which chaos is  likely to reign (Luo, 2002; Mintzberg, 1994; Volberda, 1998). In this respect,  Dyer and Chu (2003) notice that “it seems that even for high-trusting rela-  tionships, it is necessary to spend some effort up-front to make sure that the  responsibilities of each party are clearly spelled out” (p. 64). Support is also  provided by Hoecht’s (2004) study of collaborative research projects, in  which he found that legal instruments such as detailed contracts were con-  sidered normal rules of the game, which were not even relaxed if parties had  long cooperative histories.  Very high levels of formal coordination and control can be detrimental to  interorganizational performance as well because they may entail “cumber-  some, overregulated, and impersonal processes that individuals are forced to  adhere to” (Beck & Kieser, 2003, p. 794; Weibel, this issue). Excessive for-  malization leads to conflict and disagreement among parties (Ring & Van de  Ven, 1994). It also has a retarding effect on creativity and innovation, and it  inhibits the flexibility that is needed for coping with complex, ambiguous, and  unstable task environments (Mintzberg, 1994; Nooteboom, 1999; Volberda,  1998). High levels of formalization may further stifle desirable mutual accom-  modations (Ireland, Hitt, & Vaidyanath, 2002; Nooteboom, 1999) and easily  degenerate into formalism (Balogun & Johnson, 2004; Mintzberg, 1994;  Starbuck, 1983). Finally, they may result in areas of unilateral dependence  (Lusch & Brown, 1996; Macneil, 1980), hold-up problems (Klein, Crawford,  & Alchian, 1978), and considerable transaction costs (Williamson, 1985). We  Vlaar et al. / Interorganizational Relationships 415   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://gom.sagepub.comDownloaded from   therefore contend that, all else remaining equal, very low and very high levels  of formal coordination and control have a negative effect on interorganiza-  tional performance. We capture this in a third proposition (see also Figure 1).  Proposition 3: Very low and very high levels of formal coordination and control  have a negative effect on interorganizational performance.  Combinations of Governance Forms  Hitherto, we have described several individual effects of trust, distrust,  and formal coordination and control on interorganizational performance.  However, we also advance that combinations of these governance forms  may affect interorganizational performance. We focus on one particularly  precarious combination here, consisting of a high level of trust joined with  low levels of distrust and formal control. In this situation, the danger lurks  around the corner that a firm becomes an easy target for exploitation by  greedy partners (Wicks, Berman, & Jones, 1999; Zeng & Chen, 2003).  This risk arises from the fact that trust may be based on systematic biases  (Jeffries & Reed, 2000; McEvily, Perrone, & Zaheer, 2003b) and from the  notion that firms can never completely rule out that partners see it as  advantageous to cheat (Lane & Bachmann, 1997). It is reinforced by the  fact that even trustworthy partners can be relied on to be untrustworthy if  the incentives are large enough (Dasgupta, 1988). Anderson and Jap  (2005) therefore advance that “while cozy relationships sound good in  theory, such relationships also provide an opportunity for covert activities  designed to systematically cheat a partner” (p. 78). Similarly, Langfred  (2004) argues that, under certain conditions, trust can be harmful, as it  encourages actors to suspend judgment of others. This could manifest  itself in the initial denial of problems, in giving others the benefit of the  doubt, and in giving second chances more frequently (Hoetker, 2005).  Managers asking themselves, “Our partners are so trustworthy; how could  they be exploiting us?” may be reminiscent of such cases (Anderson &  Jap, 2005, p. 76).  In fact, trust may go so far that “one takes the relation for granted and does  not continuously think about opportunities to gain extra advantage from it,  nor does one consider the other to do so” (Klein Woolthuis et al., 2005,  p. 816). An example consists of a relationship between an automaker and one  of its suppliers as described by Anderson and Jap (2005). The automaker  invested heavily in this relationship, which eventuated in a high level of  mutual trust. However, the automaker’s trust was abused by the supplier,  416 Group & Organization Management   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://gom.sagepub.comDownloaded from   which “cut corners in a calculating manner” (Anderson & Jap, 2005, p. 77).  Such examples show that trust sometimes “binds and blinds, making eco-  nomic actors insufficiently vigilant and excessively vulnerable” (McEvily   et al., 2003b, p. 98) and that trust can lead to naïveté and a take-it-for-granted  mind-set in which relationships are put on cruise control (Anderson & Jap,  2005; Carson, Madhok, Varman, & John, 2003). If trust is not accompanied  by certain degrees of healthy suspicion or formal controls, an organization  risks being cheated or missing out on major opportunities. We capture this in  a fourth proposition (see also Figure 1).  Proposition 4: Relationships in which high levels of trust are accompanied by low  levels of distrust and/or formal control entail higher performance risks than rela-  tionships in which high levels of trust are accompanied by higher levels of dis-  trust and/or formal control.  Changes in Trust, Distrust, and Formal   Coordination and Control  As the framework in Figure 1 shows, interorganizational governance is  not a static phenomenon. During the relationship, managers may update  their expectations and wish to bring about changes in the coordination and  control mechanisms that they adopt (Bijlsma-Frankema & Costa, 2005;  Wicks et al., 1999). Such changes become more likely when interorganiza-  tional performance—in terms of the relational quality experienced and the  outcomes achieved—is considered weak or worse than expected in early  stages of cooperation.  Expectancy Disconfirmation  When interorganizational performance is relatively weak, managers may  come to perceive their partners as being less trustworthy than they origi-  nally thought them to be. This assertion derives from work on expectancy  disconfirmation theory, which concurs that managers’ perceptions of per-  formance trigger a comparison of actual behavior and outcomes against  their expectations (Oliver, Balakrishnan, & Barry, 1994). When positive  disconfirmation prevails, trust in a partner is reinvigorated. In the case of  negative disconfirmation, managers may blame their partners for the dis-  crepancy between actual and expected performance. Accordingly, they may  perceive that their partner is less trustworthy (March & Olsen, 1975). In a  Vlaar et al. / Interorganizational Relationships 417   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://gom.sagepub.comDownloaded from   similar vein, negative disconfirmation may cause managers to experience a  relatively high propensity to act so as to reduce deviations between actual  performance of the relationship and their expectations. This urge to act, or  feeling that something has to be done, may translate itself into a heightened  level of formal coordination and control (Sitkin & Bies, 1993). Accordingly,  we propose that levels of interorganizational performance achieved in early  stages of cooperation affect the development of trust and formal coordina-  tion and control in subsequent stages through the confirmation or discon-  firmation of expectations (see also Figure 1).  Proposition 5: The lower interorganizational performance is in early stages of coop-  eration, the larger the decline in trust in subsequent stages of development.  Proposition 6: The lower interorganizational performance is in early stages of coop-  eration, the more managers perceive a need to increase formal coordination and  control.  Interpreting the Behavior of Partners  Changes in trust and distrust also stem from the interpretation that man-  agers attribute to the behavior of their partners. These interpretations, in turn,  depend on the performance that has been achieved during earlier stages of  cooperation, the degrees of formal coordination and control that have been  adopted, and the expectations of managers regarding their partners.  Concerning performance, we believe that managers become more inclined to  interpret the behavior of their partners negatively when the quality of a rela-  tionship is low or when the outcomes of a relationship are unfavorable. In con-  trast, when performance levels are high, there is no need to blame the partner,  and his or her behavior is therefore likely to be interpreted in a more favorable  way. This is captured in the following proposition (see also Figure 1).  Proposition 7: The higher the level of interorganizational performance in prior  stages of cooperation, the more positive are managers’ interpretations of the  behavior of their partner.  Considering formal coordination and control, we propose that higher  levels of formalization make it easier for managers to interpret the behav-  ior of their partners. Formalization assists them in creating shared expecta-  tions, and it helps them to define and agree on the coordination and control  of activities and outcomes (K. J. Mayer & Argyres, 2004). In contrast, when  418 Group & Organization Management   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://gom.sagepub.comDownloaded from   formalization is low, much room is left for widely different perceptions and  frames against which meaning is made. Such a situation occurred, for  example, in an alliance between Ciba Geigy and Alza, where the absence  of reasonably detailed contractual agreements led to “growing suspicions  and tensions as each partner was searching for clues in the behavior of the  other” (Doz, 1996, p. 68). In this and similar cases, it becomes much harder  for managers to interpret the behavior of their partner. The clarity of defin-  itions and expectations that results from formalization thus facilitates  assessments of a partners’ behavior (Carson et al., 2006; Malhotra  & Murnighan, 2002). This leads us to the following proposition (see  also Figure 1).  Proposition 8: The higher the level of formalization, the easier it becomes for managers  to interpret the behavior of their partners in subsequent stages of development.  Finally, as managers make sense in ways that minimize the discrepancies  between their expectations and their observations (Kahneman & Tversky,  1973), the behavior of partners is generally interpreted so that it reinforces  existing preconceptions of trust and distrust (March & Olsen, 1975; Weick,  1995). Consequently, initial levels of trust and distrust strongly influence  whether behavior by a partner results in spirals of distrust, defensive behav-  ior, conflict, and increased emphasis on monitoring and control (Ghoshal &  Moran, 1996) or in increased levels of commitment and trust in a partner  (Klein Woolthuis et al., 2005). High levels of distrust, for example, lead  managers to interpret their partner’s behavior in a less favorable light than  would be the case if high trust prevailed (Kramer, 1994). When managers  distrust their partners, they hesitate to reveal information, reject influence,  and evade control, which complicates trust building and reinforces distrust,  potentially causing partners to fall into spirals of suspicion (Anderson & Jap,  2005; Zand, 1972). Acts by partners that are intended to restore trust may  even increase suspicion and alienate partners further from each other  (Avadikyan, Llerena, Matt, Rozan, & Wolff, 2001; Hoecht, 2004; Liebeskind  & Oliver, 1998; Sitkin & Stickel, 1996). Such acts may be perceived as evi-  dence that a firm’s goodwill or competence is thrown into doubt, rendering  them signals of distrust (Costa, 2003; Das & Teng, 1998, 2001; Ghoshal &  Moran, 1996; Jap & Ganesan, 2000; Poppo & Zenger, 2002; Sitkin & Roth,  1993). Formalization does not contribute to coordination or control here, but  it becomes destructive, undermining the development of trust (e.g., Lewicki  et al., 1998; Sitkin & Roth, 1993). It may discourage partner contributions to  Vlaar et al. / Interorganizational Relationships 419   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://gom.sagepub.comDownloaded from   a relationship, provoke human fights and aversions to change (Bijlsma-  Frankema, 2004), and give rise to a low trust atmosphere, which is frequently  reciprocated with even more formal constraints, possibly eventuating in “infla-  tionary spirals” of increasingly formalized relationships (Sitkin & Roth, 1993,  p. 367) and in relationships that are locked up in formalities (Nooteboom,  1999; Parkhe, 1993). Van Marrewijk (2004) offers an example of such a spi-  ral in his description of Unisource, an alliance of Swedish Telia, Dutch KPN  Telecom, Swiss Telecom, and Spanish Telefónica. He clarifies that as trust did  not develop, the partners turned to more formal control mechanisms. This  slowed down decision-making processes and diminished the competitiveness  of the alliance, so that trust and commitment deteriorated even more.  Conversely, when participants in interorganizational relationships initially  experience high levels of trust, attempts by their partner to establish higher  levels of formal coordination and control may be regarded as symbols of the  sharing of values and the articulation of communal norms and customs  (Zucker, 1986). Participants then presume that the other party is acting in  good faith, and they will interpret partner behavior more positively (Adobor,  2005; Uzzi, 1997). In these situations, a partner’s willingness to formalize  becomes a signal of commitment (Klein Woolthuis et al., 2005), indicating  that he or she cares about the relationship and that he or she intends to put  efforts into achieving the objectives set earlier on (Serva et al., 2005). Higher  levels of trust then ensue, which enable partners to capture other aspects of  the relationship in formal documents again (K. J. Mayer & Argyres, 2004;  Poppo & Zenger, 2002). We capture this in a final set of propositions.  Proposition 9: The higher the level of distrust and the lower the level of trust that  managers have in their partners, the more negative is their interpretation of the  behavior of their partners.  Proposition 10: The more positive managers’ interpretations of the behavior of their  partners are, the lower the level of distrust and the higher the level of trust dur-  ing subsequent stages of cooperation.  Collectively, our framework supports Doz’s (1996, p. 77) idea that initial  conditions characterizing interorganizational cooperation have “disproportion-  ate” effects on the development of interorganizational relationships. Low levels  of trust and high levels of distrust in early stages of cooperation, for example,  entail a high need for formal control and a low ability to install formal means  of coordination and control (Proposition 1). The resulting combination of trust,  420 Group & Organization Management   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://gom.sagepub.comDownloaded from   distrust, and formalization has a negative impact on interorganizational perfor-  mance (Proposition 2, Proposition 3, and Proposition 4), which subsequently  diminishes trust and increases distrust (Proposition 5). In addition, low levels of  interorganizational performance lead to an increase in formal coordination and  control (Proposition 6) and entail negative interpretations of partner behavior  (Proposition 7). As these interpretations are also shaped by the degrees of for-  mal coordination and control (Proposition 8) and by initial degrees of trust and  distrust (Proposition 9), trust is likely to diminish even more, whereas distrust  tends to increase even further (Proposition 10). The framework thus shows that  starting conditions—in the form of trust and distrust—may trigger vicious and  virtuous cycles of development (Adobor, 2005; Gambetta, 1988; Macaulay,  1963; McEvily et al., 2003b). This observation is congruent with Zand’s (1972)  spiral reinforcement model and with findings from Anderson and Jap (2005),  indicating that a significant portion of the more than 200 industrial partnerships  they studied exhibited the formation of dysfunctional spirals of distrust.  Discussion  In this article, we have developed a conceptual framework on the evolution  of trust, distrust, and formalization in interorganizational relationships.  Building on the work of other researchers (Doz, 1996; Ferrin et al., 2005; Klein  Woolthuis et al., 2005), we argued that starting conditions—consisting of ini-  tial levels of trust and distrust—leave strong imprints on the development of  cooperative relationships. Starting conditions not only influence the degrees of  formal coordination and control and the levels of performance achieved in early  stages of cooperation, but they also affect how managers interpret the behavior  of their partners. As a result, trust, distrust, and formalization tend to develop  along self-reinforcing paths. Our assertions were captured in an integrative con-  ceptual framework that reconciles hitherto fragmented views on the evolution  of trust, distrust, and formalization in interorganizational relationships.  Theoretical and Practical Implications  The model and arguments advanced in this article have significant implica-  tions for researchers and practitioners. They show how apparently inconsistent  arguments and empirical evidence on the trust-control nexus can be recon-  ciled and describe how governance forms may evolve in interorganizational  relationships. More specifically, our framework suggests that monocausal  Vlaar et al. / Interorganizational Relationships 421   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://gom.sagepub.comDownloaded from   explanations for observations on governance forms provide incomplete  accounts of reality (see also Bachmann, 1998; Möllering, 2005) and that an  integrative approach to theory development has to be taken to fully understand  the evolution of these governance forms in interorganizational relationships.  Moreover, our arguments indicate that neither trust nor formalization should  become ends in themselves, as this could lead to naïveté or rigidity, respec-  tively. Inquiries into interorganizational governance should therefore be accom-  panied by performance assessments, which help to make sure that trust and  formal coordination and control do not become final aims (see also Suen,  2005). Furthermore, the model indicates that managers have to seriously con-  sider refraining from interorganizational cooperation when starting conditions  are unfavorable as well as breaking off relationships that are characterized by  negative self-reinforcement in early stages of cooperation. Although this may  seem obvious, we emphasize it here because many relationships persist  although prospects are bad (Inkpen & Ross, 2001). We suggest that this may  partly derive from managers being unaware of the significance of starting con-  ditions and self-reinforcing effects.  Future Research  Several avenues for further research can be identified. A first and promis-  ing research direction could be to investigate the extent to which the relation-  ships in our framework are contingent on the nature of economic exchanges  and the legal regimes in which cooperation takes place. These factors may  explain a relatively large share of the variance in trust and control (Bijlsma-  Frankema & Costa, 2005). Sitkin and Stickel (1996), for example, have indi-  cated that the degree of formalization should match the nature of the task  performed to prevent escalating cycles of trust deterioration from developing.  Moreover, Williamson (1985) advanced that relationships that are embedded  in uncertain environments and for which parties have to make investments in  relation-specific assets demand more formal control than relationships for  which these investments are not required. Others have argued that formal con-  trol is problematic in exploration contexts (Oxley, 1997), as the scope of rela-  tionships cannot be clearly defined in advance, behaviors cannot be observed,  and performance tends to be ambiguous (Carson et al., 2006; Das & Teng,  2001; Dirks, 2000; Hoecht, 2004; Sitkin & Roth, 1993; Sitkin & Stickel, 1996;  Wicks et al., 1999). Although the trust-based mode of governance is probably  risky here (Carson et al., 2006), it may be the only option for leveraging the  resources that are critical to competitive advantage (Bijlsma-Frankema, 2004;  Bijlsma-Frankema & Koopman, 2004; McEvily et al., 2003b).  422 Group & Organization Management   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://gom.sagepub.comDownloaded from   In a similar vein, different institutional environments give rise to distinct  relationships between trust and formalization (Deakin & Wilkinson, 1998;  Rus & Iglič, 2005). Contractual agreements in the United Kingdom, for  example, are frequently the result of exhaustive negotiations in which each  party attempts to impose conditions on the other. Contracts then easily  become a signal of low trust. In Germany, instead, contracts are used to reas-  sure partners of the common or shared legal principles to which they wish  to adhere, something fostering trust (Bachmann, 2001). These examples  indicate that the relationships that we have depicted in our framework are  contingent on the nature of economic exchanges and on the legal regimes in  which these take place, something clearly deserving more attention in future  research (Bijlsma-Frankema & Costa, 2005).  A second option for future research concerns the ambiguity that sur-  rounds the intentions that partners have and their ability to communicate  these intentions (see also Carson et al., 2006; Klein Woolthuis et al., 2005;  Serva et al., 2005). This is important as interpretation processes can be  fraught with missteps and errors and systematic biases (March & Olsen,  1975), so that the development of trust is affected by the ability of trading  partners to “read each other” and their ability to “signal trustworthiness”  (Carson et al., 2003). Third, and in line with research by Ferrin et al. (this  issue) and Serva et al. (2005), our framework may be refined by distin-  guishing the actions and reactions from one party from those of another  party. This would offer a better reflection of the reciprocal nature of trust  building between partners. Fourth, more attention could be paid to the neg-  ative consequences or dysfunctions of trust and the positive aspects or func-  tions of formalization so as to develop a more balanced perspective on these  governance forms. The positive sentiments surrounding most research on  trust (Dirks & Ferrin, 2001) and the negative connotation that many people  have with formalization (Beck & Kieser, 2003) may be replaced by images  of both concepts that are closer to reality. Finally, research efforts could  focus on the interventions that managers undertake to make sure that trust  and formalization do not degrade or escalate beyond certain levels. Insights  into the ways in which self-reinforcing cycles can be broken and how trust  can be repaired could further advance our understanding of the evolution of  trust and formalization in interorganizational relationships.  Concluding, we have developed a conceptual framework showing that  trust and distrust during initial stages of cooperation leave strong imprints  on the development of collaborative relationships in later stages of devel-  opment. This stems from their impact on formal coordination and control,  interorganizational performance, and the interpretations that managers  Vlaar et al. / Interorganizational Relationships 423   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://gom.sagepub.comDownloaded from   attribute to the behavior of their partners. Our framework reconciles hith-  erto fragmented views on the evolution of trust, distrust, and formal coor-  dination and control in collaborative relationships, thereby offering a fertile  basis for further theorizing in this field.

J. Van Den Bosch and Henk W. Volberda  Abstract  Our study builds on extant theory on embeddedness by concentrating on the process of  preservation and dissolution of the target firm’s embedded ties in acquisitions. We iden-  tify four critical areas (communication, idiosyncratic investments, interpersonal relations  and personnel turnover) where managerial decisions taken during the acquisition process  affect the components of the target firm’s embedded ties — trust, joint problem-solving,  conflict resolution and exchange of fine-grained information. The preservation or disso-  lution of an embedded tie depends ultimately on two specific tie contingencies, the bal-  ance of power between the target firm and the embedded relation and interpretive  processes at the interface between the two. Our findings have implications for the study  of the dissolution of market ties by pointing to different roles played by social and insti-  tutional forces, power asymmetries and competition in the dynamics of embedded ties.  Finally, we encourage theory development in acquisition studies by positing the impor-  tance of interpretive processes and, more broadly, relational elements that span the  boundaries of the parent–target dyad.  Keywords: embedded ties, acquisitions, embedded tie dynamics  Typically focusing on the parent–target dyad, acquisition studies tend to overlook  the importance of relational elements such as external linkages and networks.  This paper aims to fill this gap. We concentrate on interorganizational relations  that span outside the parent–target dyad, and analyse the dynamics of the target  firm’s embedded ties during the acquisition process. As embedded relations thrive  in conditions of stability (Uzzi 1996), acquisitions represent a significant threat to  their existence and, in turn, to the potential benefits that they might generate for  both parent and target firm. Past research on the dynamics of embedded ties in  contexts characterized by high uncertainty and ambiguity is currently limited by  a lack of in-depth longitudinal case studies. Its findings are, at present, inconclu-  sive, and suggest that the acquisition process could equally lead to the mainte-  nance of the target firm’s embedded ties or to their dissolution (Uzzi 1996, 1997).  The literature on the dissolution of market ties (Baker et al. 1998) offers useful  insights in identifying some of the forces at play, but the overall impact of the  acquisition process on the target firm’s network portfolio remains uncertain.  When and how the processes of preservation or dissolution of the target firm’s  embedded ties occur are, therefore, still relatively unexplored areas but these are  important issues for both theory and practice.

Identifying the factors  that underlie these processes would also shed light on their potential impact on  important organizational dimensions such as, to name but a few, knowledge and  learning (Kogut 2000; Uzzi and Lancaster 2003; Hansen 1999), absorptive  capacity (Van den Bosch et al. 1999; Jansen et al. 2005), innovative potential  (Burt 1992). From a practical point of view, this would increase managerial  awareness as to the intended and unintended consequences of decisions taken  throughout the acquisition process, with potentially significant consequences in  terms of their effectiveness and ability to control.  Our efforts are directed towards the identification of the conditions under  which maintenance and dissolution are likely to occur and of the specific con-  tingencies affecting these processes. The exploratory research presented here  aims to encourage more in-depth longitudinal approaches in future studies of  embeddedness, and is an early response to recent calls for these types of analy-  ses by scholarly experts in the field (Angwin and Vaara 2005). The paper is  structured as follows. First, we review extant literature on the dynamics of  embedded ties and explain why the acquisition context is a particularly promis-  ing area for research. Second, we describe the research strategy and our meth-  ods of data collection. Third, we present our findings and discuss them in the  light of extant literature. Finally, we derive the main implications of our study  for both theory and practice.  Theory Background: The Dynamics of Embedded Ties and  Acquisition Processes  The concept of embeddedness relates to the idea that social structure can facil-  itate or derail economic life, thereby connecting economics with social theory  (Polanyi 1957; Granovetter 1985). The degree of embeddedness of a relation-  ship can vary, with the two extremes characterized as embedded and arm’s  length (Dacin et al. 1999). Arm’s length ties occur between actors motivated  solely by selfish and individualistic profit-seeking and behaving opportunisti-  cally to achieve their goals (North 1990; Uzzi 1996). They involve exchanges  of mainly publicly available information (Uzzi and Lancaster 2003), typically  on prices and quality, and result in impersonal and atomistic relations regulated  by short-term calculative logic (Uzzi 1997).  Embedded ties, instead, occur when commercial exchanges develop together  with strong social attachments. The parties involved are motivated by the oppor-  tunity to engage in exchanges that entail trust and reciprocity, besides profit  making (Powell 1990). Behavioural expectations are created, heuristic decision  making prevails on purely calculative logic, and the presence of trust allows for  information of private and sensitive nature to be exchanged between the parties  (Uzzi 1996, 1997; Uzzi and Lancaster 2003). Embedded ties thrive on conditions  of stability and close social relationships, and constitute a powerful integrating  mechanism (Uzzi 1996, 1997). They also tend to develop when information-  processing requirements are high, and privilege density and centralization (Baker  and Faulkner 1993).  1170 Organization Studies 28(08)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   Embedded ties provide a variety of functions for the organizations they connect  either directly through strong ties or indirectly through weak ones (Granovetter  1973). Given their information-processing qualities, repetitive nature and reliance  on trust, they provide opportunities for knowledge creation and transfer (Kogut  2000) and for explorative learning (Uzzi and Lancaster 2003), facilitate the search  for useful knowledge (Hansen 1999), and enhance knowledge absorption (Van den  Bosch et al. 1999; Jansen et al. 2005, 2006). They also contribute to the develop-  ment of social capital, which in turn allows higher rates of return from both finan-  cial and human capital, and paves the way for control advantages by facilitating  negotiations and reducing the cost of communication and coordination (Burt 1992).  Because of resource pooling, improved coordination and coordinated adaptation,  strong embedded ties enhance a firm’s chances of survival by promoting time-based  efficiency gains, risk sharing, and coordinating efficiency (Uzzi 1996, 1997).  A strong embedded tie between two organizations can, when all avenues for  connectivity are explored, constitute a weak tie for a third organization. This idea  broadens the importance of embedded ties and pushes towards network-level  analyses (Halinen et al. 1999). On the one hand, weak ties increase an organiza-  tion’s innovative potential by creating structural holes (Burt 1992), and by allow-  ing and facilitating the transfer of complex knowledge (Hansen 1999). They also  impact on the quality of strategic decision making by increasing network diver-  sity and providing variety of experiences (Beckman and Haunschild 2002). On  the other hand, weak ties combine with strong ones in generating complex and  diverse networks. Their analysis can lead to a deeper understanding of complex  and at times paradoxical phenomena in areas that include organizational learn-  ing and imitation strategies (Haunschild and Miner 1997), spill-over effects and  network transitivity (Uzzi and Gillespie 2002), and ‘domino effects’ across sev-  eral connected business relationships (Halinen et al. 1999; Hertz 1993).  Given the variety of functions that embedded ties can provide, a more in-depth  understanding of their dynamics, including when and how they maintain their  nature or, alternatively, decay, is of critical importance. Attention has so far been  mainly devoted to analyse how arm’s length ties mutate into embedded ties.  According to Uzzi (1997), a trigger such as, for example, third party referral or  previous personal relations, sets expectations of trust for partners who do not  know each other, thereby activating the transformation of an existing arm’s length  tie into an embedded one. During a trial period, a primed relationship can develop  so that calculative logic is replaced by heuristic decision making. The literature  on strategic alliances and networks formation (Gulati 1995; Powell et al. 1996)  also provides insights into the formation of embedded ties. However, the opposite  process (that is, the process of dissolution and decay of embedded ties) is still a  relatively unexplored area (Baker et al. 1998; Montgomery 1998).  We maintain that acquisitions constitute a particularly relevant context for the  study of embedded ties’ dynamics. The acquisition process represents, in fact, a  major discontinuity for the target firm and its network portfolio. Prior research in  acquisitions has mainly concentrated on the effects of the acquisition process on  the target firm or on the new organization resulting from the combination of the  two. The debate has focused on post-acquisition integration issues and their  impact on acquisition outcomes, and different perspectives — namely strategic,  Spedale et al.: Target Firm Ties in Acquisitions 1171   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   human resource, cultural, and sensemaking — highlight different aspects. The  strategy perspective focuses on the main obstacles to integration (Hunt 1990;  Hapeslagh and Jemison 1991; Pablo 1994), and on how managers can overcome  them and realize the expected and potential benefits from acquisitions (Lindgren  1982; Larsson 1990), create value (Hapeslagh and Jemison 1991), enhance learn-  ing (Leroy and Ramanantsoa 1997) and transfer capabilities (Laamanen 1997).  The human resource perspective focuses on organizational resistance to acquisi-  tions as the main obstacle in integration, and concentrates on both employees’ and  managers’ reactions (Schweiger et al. 1987; Buono and Bowditch 1989; Napier  1989; Cartwright and Cooper 1990; Schweiger and DeNisi 1991; Hambrick and  Cannella 1993; Greenwood et al. 1994; Fried et al. 1996). The cultural perspec-  tive focuses on cultural differences at both organizational (Sales and Mirvis 1984;  Buono et al. 1985; Walter 1985; Datta 1991; Chatterjee et al. 1992; Larsson 1993;  Weber et al. 1996) and national (Olie 1994; Calori et al. 1994; Very et al. 1997;  Gertsen et al. 1998) levels as the main obstacle to successful post-acquisition inte-  gration. The sensemaking perspective (Vaara 2002, 2003) overcomes the overly  rationalistic view of the integration process of the strategic, human resource and  cultural perspectives, and focuses instead on how the ‘irrational features of post-  acquisition decision-making may impede organizational integration’ (Vaara 2003:  859). Beyond clear differences in focus and approach, what these perspectives  have in common is that they concentrate on the parent-target dyad. None of them  clearly focuses on the impact of acquisitions on external relationships and net-  works. However, acquisitions are discontinuous events in the life of an organiza-  tion and generate significant uncertainty and ambiguity in all its aspects,  including the relational. They represent, therefore, an ideal setting for the study of  network relationships and their dynamics.  In maintaining this, we build on Uzzi’s insights on the phenomenon of embed-  dedness (1996, 1997), and on his observation that acquisitions increase the risk  that a firm’s connection with a core member of its network portfolio is severed.  As embedded relationships thrive in conditions of stability and close social inter-  action, acquisitions potentially constitute a mortal threat to their maintenance in  the long term. Uzzi (1996, 1997) suggested that the rationalization typically  associated with post-acquisition restructuring often compromises the basis of  existing embedded ties, leading to their break-up or dissolution into arm’s length  types. However, he also recognized that dissolution in the face of major organi-  zational changes is not inevitable and that embedded ties can be maintained in  some contexts, as proven in the case of the relocation abroad of the focus firm.  The dynamics of embedded ties in organizational contexts characterized by high  potential for uncertainty and instability are not, therefore, clearly understood in  terms of either their outcome (preservation or dissolution) or their processes.  Moreover, further developments in this field appear to be hampered by a distinct  lack, at the present time, of longitudinal case studies, a more suitable approach  for the in-depth study of organizational micro-dynamics.  The literature on the dissolution of interorganizational market ties (Baker et al.  1998) offers useful insights on the forces that might impact on the stability of  interorganizational ties in general, including embedded ones. For example, it  highlights the destabilizing role of competition and power asymmetry between  1172 Organization Studies 28(08)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   the parties to an exchange, therefore leading to market ties dissolution (Burt  1992; Fligstein 1996; Pfeffer 1987), and the stabilizing role played by institu-  tional forces including personal ties and organizational investments that promote  close bonding (DiMaggio and Powell 1983; Granovetter 1985; Seabright et al.  1992). It also suggests that institutional forces are the strongest in determining  the stability (or, conversely, dissolution) of market ties, followed by power and,  lastly, competition (Baker et al.1998).  To sum up, we maintain that acquisitions constitute organizational contexts  where uncertainty, institutional forces, competition and power asymmetry may  affect the target firm but also its network portfolio. Extant theories on the  dynamics of embedded ties under high uncertainty and on the dynamics of mar-  ket ties offer some clues but no clear answer to the problems posed by the acqui-  sition process for the maintenance or dissolution of the target firm’s embedded  ties. Given the potential benefits for both parent and target firms that might be  associated with the preservation of embedded ties — in the above mentioned  areas of knowledge and learning, efficiency and coordination, diversity and  innovative capability — a greater understanding of their dynamics must be ben-  eficial for both theory and practice. Our research efforts attempt to shed light on  the conditions under which preservation or disruption of the target firm’s  embedded ties are more likely to occur, and on the specific contingencies that  affect these dynamic processes. Our aim is to promote the development of lon-  gitudinal research in this area and, through the analysis of in-depth case stud-  ies, to answer a series of questions: What happens to the target firm’s embedded  ties when the company is acquired? Are they preserved or disrupted? Are the  patterns of preservation and dissolution always the same? What factors affect  them, and how do these processes unfold?  Research Methods  Our empirical efforts are mainly exploratory and our research strategy is repli-  cated retrospective case studies. This is justified in terms of both the nature of  the questions (Yin 1994), and the study’s main objective (Eisenhardt 1989). In  case selection, we concentrated on acquisitions motivated by the desire to  extend the parent’s product line or its international coverage and where both  parent and target firms were financially viable. Acquisitions motivated by  expansion and growth (Barkema and Vermeulen 1998) account for a large share  of recent mergers and acquisition deals (for example, about 36% of all M&A  deals over $500 million in the US for the period 1997–99). In this type of acqui-  sition, the parent firm is typically interested in the successful continuation of the  target firm’s operations as a whole, which makes the issue of potential changes  in the target firm’s embedded ties particularly poignant.  We selected two acquisition cases that varied across a number of relevant theo-  retical dimensions (absolute and relative size; the parent firm’s intended integra-  tion strategy; organizational fit; the degree of friendliness or hostility of the  acquisition) in order to control for the potential impact of organizational variables  on the dynamics of the target firm’s embedded ties. Because of the confidential  Spedale et al.: Target Firm Ties in Acquisitions 1173   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   and sensitive nature of many issues for both the companies and individual respon-  dents, we present all illustrative material anonymously. Table 1 summarizes key  information for the two cases, respectively named Edis and Candy.  We developed a pilot study on a third acquisition case not reported here. The  objectives were to carry out a preliminary test of our criteria for case selection,  to refine our measurement tools and to develop a case study protocol (Miles and  Huberman 1994). This opportunity was provided through personal contacts,  whereas the two acquisition cases presented here agreed to participate after  more formal contacts were established. Involvement with industry experts  directed the selection and provided initial access. After the conclusion of the  pilot study, extensive data collection was carried out at the two selected firms.  This involved a mixture of informal conversations, as well as open-ended and  1174 Organization Studies 28(08)  Table 1.

Numbers varied across  the cases, according to availability and need. Without including informal con-  versations and follow-up contacts, 18 interviews in Edis’s case and 22 in  Candy’s case were carried out. We interviewed industry experts (at least two for  each case) and a number of senior and middle managers from both the parent  and target firms. Besides one representative from the top management team  with responsibility for strategy development, these included the director of  human resources and the director of mergers and acquisitions (or equivalent  position; for example, the manager in charge of post-acquisition integration)  plus various account, sales and procurement managers. Interviews varied in  length from about one to over two hours, mainly depending on the type of  informant, and were tape-recorded whenever possible. Extensive notes were  also taken during interviews and company visits, and all available documenta-  tion (field notes, interview transcripts, etc.) was organized in a database to  enhance reliability and minimize investigator bias. We also collected company  documents, both internal (such as agendas, minutes of meetings, progress  reports) and external (such as public announcements, press statements and  annual reports). As for construct validity, we used a variety of tactics to make  sure that our operationalizations and measures were satisfactory. In some cases,  as in the case of the target firm’s embedded ties, we relied on a-priori specifi-  cation of the construct and on existing tested metrics.  We adopted Uzzi’s model (1997) to operationalize the concept of embedded  ties by distinguishing between social structural antecedents and components of  embedded ties (see Appendix A). We first asked key informants from the target  firm to provide a full list of all customers and suppliers before the acquisition and  to shortlist the most important ones. We then collected data on both the social  structural antecedents and the actual components of embeddedness according to  Uzzi’s conceptualization using triangulation of sources to validate our measures.  For example, in the case of exchange of fine-grained information we asked our  informants to identify the areas where information was exchanged (allowing us  to measure the extent of communications) and to quantify on a five-point scale  the level of detail of the exchanges (to gauge depth) and their perceptions about  the nature of information (to gauge sensitivity). We then compared the results  from different informants, including, whenever possible, those from the other  side (i.e. supplier or customer) of a given relationship. We also verified these data  by asking for examples of documents or reports that would corroborate them. In  some cases we were shown the documents but we were not allowed to analyse  their content, and this was interpreted as confirmation of the sensitive and pri-  vate nature of the information. On the basis of this evidence, the team discussed  and agreed on an ordinal category (very high, high, medium, low, very low) that  would summarize the various measures into a single indicator of ‘exchange of  fine-grained information’. A similar process was followed for other dimensions  (either structural antecedents or components) of embeddedness. Finally, we  identified the ties that proved to be ‘embedded’ according to our operational  measurements. The criteria for judging changes (dissolution) in embeddedness  level were in line with Uzzi’s model (1997) and with extant theory on the disso-  lution of embedded ties (Baker et al. 1998; Montgomery 1998): i.e. exit from the  relationship or a radical change in its main characteristics (such as, for example,  Spedale et al.: Target Firm Ties in Acquisitions 1175   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   a significant reduction in trust, severe interruptions to the exchange of private  information, or increased level of conflict).  Throughout data collection and analysis, we used triangulation (Pettigrew  1988) whenever possible, and validation from participants was sought and  incorporated. Also, precautionary measures were adopted to overcome the lim-  itations of retrospective recollections. For example, we made sure that temporal  proximity to the studied event was guaranteed by selecting cases that were still  in the post-acquisition integration stage at the time of data collection. Finally,  multiple perspectives were employed to reduce the danger of biased recollec-  tions and interviews were carried out at both the parent and target firm when-  ever possible.  Research Findings  The research findings relate to two key aspects, each addressed individually in  a specific sub-section. The first concerns the nature and context of target firms’  embedded ties before the acquisition. The associated sub-section provides a  detailed picture of these relationships at the onset of the changes recorded dur-  ing the study. The second concerns the dynamics of the target firm’s embedded  ties during the acquisition process. The associated sub-section focuses on the  changes to the social structural antecedents and the components of these  embedded relations and on the specific contingencies that influenced the  processes of, respectively, dissolution and preservation.  The Target Firms’ Embedded Ties before the Acquisition: Nature and  Context  All the target firms’ embedded ties in the study consisted of relationships with  suppliers and customers and showed fundamentally similar characteristics (see  Table 2).  First, all were long standing, ranging from a minimum of 10 years to over 25.  Edis’s embedded supplier in Table 2 had participated, through a combination of  spin-off and cooperation with other airlines, in the creation of Edis itself. The  already close relationship between this supplier and Edis was reinforced by  means of a mandatory participation agreement. Although this agreement was no  longer active at the time of the study, it had contributed in previous years to cre-  ate the necessary conditions of trust and reduced risk that allowed the two com-  panies to engage in a series of significant process adjustments to increase their  operational fit. Moreover, it had guaranteed Edis’s access to the entire range of  services provided by its supplier, a necessary condition for its success as an  intermediary. The mandatory agreement was later replaced by a broader part-  nership agreement, and this was interpreted as a sign that genuine long-term  trust had developed. One of Edis’s account managers recalled:  ‘We had been in business together since the start and we worked together. When they  changed their reservation system, we modified our own operations. It was not always  easy, but we talked and we knew they were not just trying to make life harder for us.  They wanted to improve, and so did we.’  1176 Organization Studies 28(08)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   This is confirmed by one of Edis’s more senior managers:  ‘Trust means commitment and we [i.e. the more senior managers] were right there, espe-  cially if there were problems. And this sent a message to them: We are here and we want  to make it work for both of us.’  The partnership agreement did not prevent exit from the relationship, had the  companies wished it, and there was no significant poison ‘pill’. This was explained  in terms of the fact that it would have been difficult for the partners, and espe-  cially for Edis, to abandon the partnership, given the amount of idiosyncratic  investments realized over time and its reliance on this supplier’s full range of  services for its own success.  As for the embedded customers in Table 2, their relationships with Edis were,  respectively, over 10 and 12 years old. One of them, in particular, was using  Spedale et al.: Target Firm Ties in Acquisitions 1177  Table 2.

In  both cases, there had been significant process adjustments by both sides. When  reflecting on the nature of the relationship with their closest customer in Table 2,  one of Edis’s account managers recalled:  ‘They basically used to make all their reservation through us, and when they changed  their system there were a lot of problems. But there are always problems, even when you  don’t change a thing. What we did was sit down and talk, me, them, also some of the  other managers [i.e. more senior ones] and find a way out that was good for them and  us. The fact is, after you do it a few times with the same people and get to know each  other’s way, it becomes easier.’  This shows how joint problem solving operated in practice, relying on both a  shared understanding of the long-term nature of the relationship, the reciprocal  interdependence, and the active and informal involvement and commitment of  managers at different levels of the organization.  The volatile nature of the business made continuous interactions between Edis  and its embedded customers a critical aspect of their relationship. Communications  were very intense and extremely frequent, characterized by high levels of face-to-  face interactions. The presence of the same account manager, who, according to  our sources, had maintained his position for over six years, proved a key success  factor. Interpersonal relationships, in this case, appeared to reinforce interorgani-  zational ones, allowing for higher degrees of trust to develop and for the transfer  across Edis and its embedded customers of fine-grained information through a  very quick and effective channel. One of Edis’s current account managers, who had  been in a more junior position before the acquisition, recalled how   ‘we met at least twice a week. They needed a lot of information that was not easy to get,  and we did pass it on. For us, meeting regularly was useful because we would anticipate  problems, and sort them out before they really blew up in our faces.’  Although it would have been easier for Edis to find new customers than for its  embedded customers to replace it as key provider, this did not seem to play a  significant role in shaping the relationship beyond the precautionary step of  drafting very detailed contracts. As noted earlier, from both sides there seemed  to be a mutual understanding of the long-term nature of the relationship and  interpersonal elements contributed towards maintaining the truth of this belief.  Candy’s relationships with its embedded suppliers in Table 2 had each been  in place for over 25 years. These were the main suppliers of two of Candy’s fun-  damental raw materials, sugar and glucose. Over time, significant reciprocal  adjustments had occurred, concerning size of operations, plant capacity and  operational processes. These adjustments were regarded as fundamentally  important for the maintenance of constant quality levels, one of the key success  factors in Candy’s own production efficiency and effectiveness. In both cases,  partnership agreements were drafted when a just-in-time system was intro-  duced, which also required increasing levels of information exchange and the  establishment of continuous communication channels. Some of these exchanges  involved information of a sensitive and ‘strategic’ nature, and managers at more  senior levels were involved regularly, as one of them recalled:  1178 Organization Studies 28(08)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   ‘We talked over long term issues, things such as decisions on product mix and quality,  often anticipating our next moves. It was not about “giving our secrets away”, but —  well, yes — some of the stuff was rather confidential.’  The exchange of fine-grained and sensitive information was supported by the  presence of significant levels of trust and reciprocal commitment. These were  reinforced by the practice of joint problem solving, which relied on a carefully  balanced combination of regular, scheduled meetings, formal assessment and  ongoing, personal interactions. Strong emphasis was put on self-certification.  These practices did not prevent a high level of attention being paid to the drafting  of exhaustive contracts. A documentary analysis of Candy’s contracts with one of  its embedded suppliers prior to the acquisition confirmed, in fact, the presence of  very detailed terms and conditions, especially relating to quality. This was in line  with interview reports from procurement managers, and was later confirmed in an  informal conversation with a member of the supplier’s organization. The detailed  nature of these contracts might be interpreted as a direct contradiction of the advo-  cated trust, but other explanations are also possible. In Candy’s case, both the pro-  curement manager and our informant with the supplier confirmed that the level of  detail in the contract only related to technical aspects, in order to guarantee sta-  bility and high quality of supply. They also stated that both parties had willingly  agreed to this level of contractual detail, considered ‘normal in our business’ and,  more specifically, did not interpret it as a sign of lack of trust. When pressed, they  tended to point towards the informality and regularity of their communications,  and their collaborative spirit in solving potential problems, as emerges from the  following quote from an interview with the procurement manager:  ‘That’s not what it means [“it” being the association between detailed contracts and lack of  trust as suggested by the interviewer]; it’s only a technical matter. Trust is different; it’s  about talking and being open with each other. If you have a problem, you tell me and I see  what I can do because it is also my problem. That is how it worked with them, and still does.’  Candy’s relationship with its embedded customer in Table 2 had also been ongo-  ing for over 25 years. Although contracts only lasted one year and were very  detailed, the relationship was characterized by a long-term perspective on both  sides and high levels of trust. These were, in fact, considered necessary elements  for the significant adjustments made by Candy to its own operations to meet the  demands and expectations of this important customer. A system of just-in-time  had been introduced, thereby facilitating coordination and communications, and  reducing cost. Moreover, Candy had altered its distribution system to suit the  needs of its embedded customer, and had also promoted innovation in its pack-  aging to fit its requirements. One of Candy’s managers emphasized how   ‘trust was a big part of it, it was essential. If we had not trusted each other, we would not  have done things such as JIT; we would not have agreed to deliver to their central distri-  bution centre, to our inconvenience; we would not have changed things such as our pack-  aging size and format just to please them.’  This was by no means Candy’s only customer, and the company was constantly  entering new geographical markets, thereby expanding its customer base and, to  a certain degree, shifting its focus from the country of origin to other places.  However, exiting from this particular relationship would have been   Spedale et al.: Target Firm Ties in Acquisitions 1179   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   ‘almost impossible. It is not only that we have been in business together for so long. There  are also significant costs associated with losing this customer, whether or not we replace  it. Some are clearly visible, in the just-in-time and all the other systems we have that are  specifically devoted to them. But some are hidden. It’s in the shared history and the under-  standing, in our shared culture, in the fact that we are from the same place in an expand-  ing world. This matters because it gives you safety and reliance.’ (senior manager, Candy)  The Dynamics of the Target Firms’ Embedded Ties  To sum up, prior to the acquisition, all target firms’ embedded ties in Table 2  were characterized by high levels of trust, mutual adjustments and idiosyncratic  investments, intense communications at various organizational levels, and  mechanisms for conflict resolution that relied more on discussions than on for-  malized contracts and procedures. The very same ties two or three years after  the acquisition offer a somewhat different picture. One (Edis’s embedded sup-  plier) no longer exists. Moreover, Edis’s relationship with one of its customers  would no longer qualify as ‘embedded’ in the definition adopted for this study  (Uzzi 1997). More specifically, the level of trust has reduced dramatically as  stated by one of the customer’s managers:  ‘Things are different, “frostier” in a way, from what they used to be. I am dealing with  different people, and with a different style. I personally don’t like it, but it’s still business  and we have to do what is best in the situation. Perhaps things will improve with time,  when we learn to work together again. But it will take some time and some hard work,  especially to build the same trust.’  Moreover, the level of conflict has significantly increased, as testified by a more  than threefold increase in the number of formal complaints since the time of the  acquisition (source: customer’s company data). According to the manager quoted  above:  ‘We now put things down in writing, to keep a clear trace and set the record straight. It  used to be done over the phone, and there was less of it, but now we have to be more  careful about how we deal with them.’  On the other hand, Edis’s relationship with the other customer in Table 2 can still  be classified as embedded. Although there has been an increase in the level of  conflict, it appears that both parties still regard the level of trust as high and that  problems are still dealt with on an informal, ad hoc basis. All of Candy’s embed-  ded relationships in Table 2 are also still classifiable as embedded. These varied  patterns raise a series of questions: What can explain these changes? Why did  some of the embedded ties dissolve either completely or into more arm’s length  ones whereas others were preserved? How did these processes of dissolution and  preservation unfold?  As expected, in the case of both Edis and Candy the acquisition produced  overall uncertainty regarding the future prospects of the target firms and their  respective network portfolios, but the two dissolved ties identified above  seemed to be affected in unique and different ways. As the preservation of  Edis’s relationship with a second embedded customer in Table 2 shows, the  processes of tie dissolution or preservation are complex and cannot be simply  ascribed to changes occurring within the target firm’s organization. Specific tie  1180 Organization Studies 28(08)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   contingencies are also involved, as the following analysis aims to show. In order  to identify the patterns described below, and schematically summarized in  Figure 1, we identified and analysed a series of events, initiatives and actions  that, throughout the acquisition process, might have impacted on the target  firms’ embedded ties in favour of either ‘preservation’ or ‘dissolution’.  We categorized each event or initiative in terms of its focus and intensity and,  following extant theory that suggests how managerial practices impact on the level  of embeddedness of business ties (Uzzi 1996), we identified a number of critical  areas through which tie dynamics could be comparatively observed and presented.  Processes of Dissolution  A first common element in the pattern of dissolution of Edis’s relationship with  its supplier and with one of the customers in Table 2 is the breaking down of  communications between these ties and the target firm. The frequency, intensity  and richness of communication exchanges altered considerably following the  acquisition. Company documents and interview data show that the news of the  acquisition was communicated to Edis’s embedded supplier in Table 2 by its  account manager only after the official announcement had taken place. It was  then followed by a visit from one of the senior managers of the parent firm, but  these combined actions did not manage to reassure Edis’s supplier about the con-  sequences for its long-term business prospects with the target firm. The parent  firm’s plans with regards to future relations with this supplier were, in fact, not  firmly established, as recalled by one of the target firm’s procurement managers:  ‘They [i.e. the parent] did not really know about our most important suppliers. They did  not realize that communication was important to them. And I don’t mean general infor-  mation, I mean the attention that you give to people who have been working with you  for over twenty years.’  The key area of difficulty concerned whether or not there would be a signif-  icant change in the range and extent of the services procured. In the past, Edis  Spedale et al.: Target Firm Ties in Acquisitions 1181  Figure 1  An Interpretive  Framework of the  Dynamics of the  Target Firm’s  Embedded Ties in  Acquisitions  Areas for managerial  decisions and actions  Dynamics of  the target firm’s  embedded ties    Communications    Idiosyncratic investments    Interpersonal relations    Personnel turnover    Trust    Joint problem solving    Conflict resolution    Exchange of fine-grained   information    Dissolution  Preservation       Tie-specific contingencies    Balance of power between target   firm and embedded relation    Interpretive processes between   target firm and embedded relation  Components of the target  firm’s embedded ties   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   had relied on the full spectrum of services offered by the supplier, but this could  not be guaranteed for the future, with obvious implications for the supplier’s  prospects in terms of both volume and mix of sales. Edis’s account manager at  the time (now working in a different role) recalled how this ongoing uncertainty  affected his personal relationship with his counterpart at the supplier’s end:  ‘Things had changed but I did not know exactly how. I guess they waited until they  could, to see what would happen, but they then decided to put their energies into servic-  ing somebody else. It’s an expanding market, and there are plenty of intermediaries like  us so it was not too difficult for them to replace us, whereas it is proving a lot more dif-  ficult for us to get the same somewhere else.’  This inability to communicate about future business opportunities also charac-  terized the development of Edis’s relationships with its no longer embedded  customer. Edis’s account manager recalled:  ‘I did not know about it — the acquisition —, it all came out of the blue. And sure, we  were worried because that is what you do if you don’t know what is going on, where you  are going. I did not know what to say to my contacts either, whether I should be open  about it or not.’  He also experienced a progressive deterioration of his personal relationship  with his counterpart, which he described as follows:  ‘I could see that my reticence was not helpful, and I was losing face. My customers were  becoming more and more aggressive and you can only say “trust me, it’s going to be  fine” without backing it up with more “meat” so many times before you lose them. But  I did not know where to go, the senior people did not seem to be able to help.’  As a result of these changes in communications and interpersonal relations,  Edis’s embedded customer reassessed its views on the overall transparency and  commitment of the target firm to the existing relationship, and responded by  adjusting in turn to the altered circumstances. A break-up of the overall rela-  tionship was not really feasible in the short term, given that Edis was the single  biggest supplier for this company, but other actions were, as revealed by inter-  view and company data, rapidly taken. For example, the ongoing transfer of  sensitive information that had characterized the relationship in the past was  interrupted, and a new communication ‘policy’ was devised, based on a more  carefully and formally regulated pattern of interaction.  For both dissolved ties, communication and interpersonal problems were com-  pounded by decisions taken by the new management of the parent firm in other  areas, and in particular on the level and nature of the idiosyncratic investments in  these relationships. In the case of Edis’s embedded supplier, for example, the ratio-  nalization plan following the acquisition brought about the partial dismantling of  some of the operational systems that had been in the past specifically adapted to  tailor this particular relationship. This reinforced the supplier’s perception that a  reduced level of commitment had to be expected in the future, and encouraged this  company to find alternative and more promising long-term outlets for its services.  In the case of Edis’s no longer embedded customer, managerial decisions affected  the relationship by means of drastic cuts to the account managers’ financial bud-  gets, which entailed diminished resources for travelling, less frequent visits and  reduced face-to-face interactions. These negative side effects are clearly high-  lighted by one of the retained sales managers of the target firm:  1182 Organization Studies 28(08)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   ‘We used to be able to work hand-in-hand with our clients, but all that disappeared as  soon as money was cut. They [i.e. the parent firm’s managers] did not seem to under-  stand how we worked, they were not interested.’  The same manager, reflecting on the character and impact of these cost-cutting  measures, observed:  ‘I tried hard to keep up, but it became impossible. What was I supposed to do? I did not  have the same money as before, so I could not operate as before. But it was difficult to  explain that to people that you knew well and had different expectations. I kept saying,  it’s not me, it’s the situation, but that did not stop them complaining and getting tougher.’  The change in circumstances due to reduced resources and new procedures led  people to reassess their relative positions, and change their behaviours. Personal  and informal relations gave way to formally regulated contacts, conflicts  became more widespread and negotiating positions hardened.  Communication and interpersonal problems, and levels of idiosyncratic  investment led, in both cases of dissolved embedded relationships, to increased  levels of conflict. This combined with significant changes in the nature of con-  flict resolution mechanisms, and led to the substantial collapse of joint problem  solving, one of the components of embedded ties. In the case of Edis’s supplier,  tension escalated rapidly. Once it became clear that the long-term business con-  ditions underlying the relationship had changed for the worse, the supplier  exited the partnering agreement and switched to one of the target firm’s com-  petitors. In the case of Edis’s customer there was a clear shift in the components  of embedded ties: from informal mechanisms of conflict resolution and prob-  lem solving to a more formal and contractually based relationship. In the recol-  lection of the parties involved, this shift was generally related to personnel  turnover within the target firm at different levels. The departure of a number of  old middle and senior managers in the aftermath of the acquisition led to a sig-  nificant reduction in the number of levels for interaction between the target firm  and its once embedded customer, thereby limiting the opportunities for higher-  level mediation and reducing the scope for joint problem solving. The follow-  ing analysis by one of the retained account managers illustrates this point:  ‘Before, if there was a problem between us [i.e. account managers and business rela-  tions], our management could help. They were on good terms and knew people. They  were involved. Now, if we have a problem it is only us and nobody else can really inter-  vene and mediate.’  The direct involvement of more senior managers, alongside account managers,  in the target firm’s embedded tie had been an essential element of this relation-  ship prior to the acquisition, as shown in the previous section. The removal of  this critical element due to high personnel turnover during the acquisition  affected negatively the existing level of trust, and further compromised com-  munications between the parties.  Processes of Preservation  The analysis of the processes of preservation focuses on changes occurring in the  critical areas individually considered to highlight in more detail their impact on the  components of the embedded ties. In the majority of the cases where embedded  ties were preserved during the acquisition, communications between the target firm  Spedale et al.: Target Firm Ties in Acquisitions 1183   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   and its embedded relations were not significantly affected. Information exchanges  did not alter in intensity, nature, level of ‘richness’ or indeed sensitivity. The only  exception is Edis’s preserved relationship with one of the customers in Table 2.  During the negotiation stage of Candy’s acquisition, all the target firm’s embedded  ties received some form of communication from the parent firm. These exchanges  had been ‘tailored’ to the specific parties involved, with the explicit objective of  reassuring them regarding the long-term direction of business relations. Initial con-  tacts were followed up by a series of phone calls and visits from the target firm’s  old top managers and some of the new members of the management team, during  which, as recalled by one of the managers involved:  ‘We clearly explained what our company stood for and where we wanted to go, and how the  acquisition would achieve all this. They asked questions and we did all we could to answer  and reassure them. We had, actually, several meetings, depending on individual cases.’  This promoted openness and contributed to dispel the embedded ties’ natural  worries about the future of their business operations. The target firm’s long-  term commitment to these relationships was also reinforced through other com-  munication mechanisms, including the use of the local language by the new  owners. One of the key relations in Table 2 recalled:  ‘You saw them (i.e. the new managers) and could talk to them. They were making an  effort to reassure us, by being there, and also spoke our language, which made an impres-  sion. I remember everybody talked about it, the language, and we even made jokes about  it. But it was good, very good.’  Communications between the parent firm, the target firm and its embedded ties  continued regularly after the acquisition.  In the case of Edis’s only preserved relationship (one of the embedded cus-  tomers in Table 2), levels of uncertainty following the acquisition remained, on  the contrary, quite high. Communication problems similar to those observed for  the dissolved ties described earlier developed in this case as well, but the situation  developed in a different direction. Other circumstances intervened to reduce the  overall impact of both uncertainty and communications problems. First of all, this  particular customer did not rely exclusively on Edis for its supply but had a more  dispersed and diversified supply base. At a time of potential crisis for the rela-  tionship, this allowed this company to take, in the words of one of its managers,  ‘a more long-term view of the potential problems but also the potential benefits’.  The acquisition had, in fact, brought uncertainty but had also inspired some cau-  tious satisfaction in view of the future opportunities for business expansion that  might be realized by the customer through its connection with a larger supplier.  This more optimistic interpretation of the mutated circumstances transpires from  the following statement by one of the managers of Edis’s preserved customer:  ‘We did not know what the future would bring, if they (the parent) wanted big changes.  But for us it could be an opportunity and we tried to see it that way and make things work  as before.’  The possibility of moving on to bigger business in the future generated, in  this case, the necessary goodwill on the part of Edis’s customer to try to solve  the current problems.  1184 Organization Studies 28(08)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   In all cases where embedded ties were maintained, decisions taken by the new  management with regard to the level and nature of the idiosyncratic investments  in these relationships did not have disrupting effects. In the case of Candy’s  embedded suppliers, every effort was made to maintain stability of operations,  given the importance of a constant and reliable level of quality supply for the tar-  get firm’s own success. One of the target firm’s senior managers recalled how the  integration plan explicitly comprised its firm’s embedded suppliers:  ‘Keeping operations smooth was priority number one; the rest would follow. With inter-  ruptions, people start arguing about whose fault it is, and this creates divisions and hos-  tility. But we knew very well how each other worked — no surprises there — and if it  had worked in the past, why should it all go wrong now?’  Candy’s parent firm developed an integration plan that prioritized a number of  key integration issues, each delegated to a dedicated, especially appointed com-  mittee. Strict deadlines were set. The target firm’s account managers in charge of  the ties in Table 2 were directly involved in some of these committees. Their  responsibilities included ‘continuation of operations’ and, specifically, the main-  tenance ‘of good business relations with our customers and suppliers’ (source:  from an internal document). The pressure to achieve fast results pushed them to  increase their efforts, so that more resources were actually invested in the embed-  ded ties than before, and closer cooperation was actively promoted. For example,  visits were specifically organized with the declared intent to reinforce commit-  ment and trust levels, and a press bulletin on the acquisition was regularly dis-  tributed to the target firm’s embedded ties.  In the case of Edis’s embedded customer whose relationship was preserved,  the acquisition integration plan, as stated earlier, included a significant reduction  in the account manager’s financial budget thereby reducing the level of idiosyn-  cratic investments for this particular relationship. In this case, however, the  impact of diminished resources for travelling, less frequent visits and reduced  face-to-face interactions was not as traumatic as in the case of the embedded cus-  tomer analysed above. A radically different interpretation was given by this cus-  tomer to the nature, relevance and time-scale of the difficulties following the  acquisition combined with a long-term view of the potential gains attached to  this business partnership. Instead of shifting towards a more formal and less ‘per-  sonally based’ relationship, this customer made a positive effort to maintain and  support its existing tie. This process was facilitated by the fact that there was no  change in another critical area for embeddedness, personnel turnover. The group  of people directly involved in the relationship was not modified and the old  account manager maintained his position. In his recollection of events, the  embedded customer actually increased its level of commitment by   ‘switching a gear. There were so many problems that I thought we might lose them at  some stage. But they stuck with us, and I think that our relationship is actually stronger  now. At least, I feel I trust them more.’  And also:  ‘They could have created a lot of fuss, because we were treating them so badly, but they  were patient and carried on talking to us, to me, and discussed ways to move things forward.  Spedale et al.: Target Firm Ties in Acquisitions 1185   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   I will never forget that. It was a joint effort, between me and them, and now things are slowly  getting better again.’  In this particular case, disrupted communications and decreased levels of  idiosyncratic investments generated an increase in the level of complaints. This,  however, did not affect existing methods of joint problem solving, nor did it  lead to a prevalence of contractual relations over personal contact or to a more  cautious approach with regard to the exchange of fine-grained information.  Quite the opposite, the specific tie contingencies of the relationship between  Edis and this embedded customer seemed to promote an intensifying of joint  problem solving and informal mechanisms for communications, with positive  implications for the level of trust and the maintenance of the tie as embedded.  In the case of Candy’s preserved embedded ties, personnel turnover, both at  the ties interface and at more senior levels within the target firm, was very low.  For example, generous retention packages for all managers and employees  involved in relations with the network, irrespective of their hierarchical level,  were put in place. These conditions seemed to reinforce prior levels of trust,  feeding a virtuous cycle of mutually reinforcing dynamics.  Discussion  The research findings above highlight the complexity of the dynamics of the tar-  get firm’s embedded ties in acquisition contexts. In the presence of high levels  of uncertainty and ambiguity, processes of tie dissolution and preservation are  affected by a complex web of managerial decision and actions in a number of  critical areas. These actions and decisions operate at different organizational  levels, sometimes in different directions. They can also lead to different results  in terms of the dissolution or preservation of a given embedded tie, depending  on its specific tie contingencies. It is, as a result, difficult to derive general con-  clusions on the direction and ‘sign’ of these interactions, but important consid-  erations can nonetheless be put forward as to what matters and when.  First of all, it appears that the processes of tie preservation and dissolution  observed in this study are associated with managerial decisions and actions in  four critical areas, namely communication, level of idiosyncratic investments,  interpersonal relations and personnel turnover. Changes in these four critical  areas, occurring at different levels of the organization, can be systematically  associated with the following components of the target firm’s embedded ties:  changes in the level of trust of the target firm’s embedded ties, as well as in the  type of information exchanged and in the nature of the conflict resolution mech-  anisms and problem-solving solutions adopted (see Figure 1).  Our findings, however, indicate that the exact nature and direction of these  associations, and the ultimate effect in terms of either the preservation or the  dissolution of the embedded ties involved, are not easy to generalize. Three  problematic aspects can be identified. First, similar conditions in one of the four  critical areas above help to discriminate between patterns of dissolution and  preservation in some cases but not in others. For example, communications are  clearly different in the case of the dissolved tie between Edis and its supplier on  1186 Organization Studies 28(08)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   the one hand (communications deteriorated) and in the case of the preserved ties  between Candy and its suppliers on the other (communications were main-  tained). They do not, however, discriminate between the former and the case of  Edis’s preserved customer where communications were equally disrupted. This  apparent inconsistency points to the presence of mixed interactions, which can  in principle be explained in systemic terms.  A second problematic aspect is connected to the fact that changes in the same  critical area can operate at different organizational levels in opposite directions  with, ultimately, diverging results. An example is personnel turnover. In Edis’s  ties with its embedded customers, low personnel turnover at the operational  level of tie interface (in both cases the same account managers were main-  tained) combined with high personnel turnover at the levels of middle and  senior managers (senior managers who, prior to the acquisition were directly  involved in joint problem solving with these embedded ties were replaced by  newcomers who did not engage in the same activities). This set of circum-  stances also applied to Edis’s embedded customers, but was associated with  very different tie dynamics, coinciding in one case with the dissolution of the  relationship and in the other with its maintenance.  A third problematic aspect is that entirely similar sets of circumstances,  namely, similar changes in the four critical areas in terms of both levels and  directions, can nonetheless be associated with different results in terms of tie  dissolution and preservation. This suggests that the process of either preserva-  tion or dissolution of an embedded tie is likely to occur under a given set of cir-  cumstances (that is, when changes in the four critical areas occur during the  acquisition) but is ultimately determined by the specific contingencies of the tie  involved. Two such specific tie contingencies are apparent in our findings. The  first is the nature of the interdependence between the target firm and the embed-  ded tie itself, which reflects their relative balance of power. The second is the  interpretation given by the actors directly involved in the specific relationship  to the altered circumstances, which leads them to reorient (or maintain unal-  tered) their behaviours. In the case of Edis’s embedded customers, very similar  changes in the four critical areas throughout the organization combined with  profoundly different tie contingencies. The customer whose embedded rela-  tionship dissolved was highly dependent on the supply of the target firm. Prior  to the acquisition the balance of power was in favour of the target firm, but a  long-term stability had been achieved through the development of ‘embedded-  ness’. With the new circumstances brought about by the acquisition, this long-  term equilibrium in the mutual interdependence between Edis and its embedded  customer was broken, and this imbalance was amplified when the latter inter-  preted the situation as a potential threat to its own survival. The relationship  could not be entirely severed in the short term, but a balancing act was achieved  by adjusting — that is, by reducing — the level of ‘embeddedness’ to reflect the  new circumstances. The context was different in the case of Edis’s preserved  embedded customer. This was less dependent on the supply of the target firm as  its supply base was more diversified. As the acquisition took place, the existing  balance of power between the two was modified, but Edis’s customer inter-  preted the situation in terms of an opportunity to increase the companies’  Spedale et al.: Target Firm Ties in Acquisitions 1187   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   mutual interdependence. This enhanced interdependence combined with the  more optimistic interpretation given by the actors involved to promote the main-  tenance, if not the actual deepening, of the pre-existing level of embeddedness.  These considerations lead to the generic conclusion that the processes of  preservation and dissolution of the target firm’s embedded ties cannot be easily  modelled, but several contributions can nonetheless be highlighted. The first is  the identification of the four critical areas of communication, idiosyncratic  investments, interpersonal relations and personnel turnover, which are consistent  with the social structural antecedents of embedded ties in Uzzi’s model (1996,  1997: see also Appendix A). Changes in these four critical areas due to manage-  rial actions and decisions during the acquisition process can impact, as Uzzi  anticipated and our findings confirm, on the actual components of the embedded  ties, namely trust, joint problem solving and exchange of fine-grained informa-  tion. However, our findings expand on Uzzi’s model by showing how these  changes by themselves are not enough to explain whether an embedded tie actu-  ally dissolves or is preserved. Two specific tie contingencies prove decisive in  our cases: the mutual interdependence between the target firm and its embedded  relation, with its associated balance of power, and interpretive processes occur-  ring at the interface between the two (see Figure 1).  The role of specific tie contingencies is key in the transformation of an embed-  ded tie into a more arm’s length one, or in its dissolution. In analysing processes  of embeddedness formation, Uzzi noted that a primer or trigger (for example,  third party referral) is needed to instigate the transformation of a market relation  into an embedded one. Our findings indicate that a trigger is also needed for the  reverse process, and the two identified tie contingencies play this role. Our find-  ings are also consistent with prior research on the dissolution of market ties  (Baker et al. 1998), as the four critical areas are associated with the social and  institutional forces that, according to this line of inquiry, are relevant for the sta-  bility or dissolution of market ties. But our findings also point to significant dif-  ferences. More specifically, the literature on the dissolution of market ties  suggests that institutional and social forces tend to promote tie stability  (Granovetter 1985; Seabright et al. 1992) whereas competition and power asym-  metry (Burt 1992; Fligstein 1996) promote dissolution. Our analysis reveals a  more complicated set of relations. Social and institutional forces, operating in our  case through changes in the four critical areas, do not appear to have a decisive  impact on the preservation or dissolution of the target firm’s embedded ties, which  is ultimately affected by specific tie contingencies, one of which is indeed mutual  interdependence with its associated balance of power. This means that, in our  cases, social and institutional forces, competition and power asymmetry have dif-  ferent roles in the processes of maintenance or dissolution of the embedded ties.  Finally, our findings highlight the critical role played by interpretive processes  in explaining phenomena that, so far, have been addressed in overly rationalistic  fashion by researchers involved in both in the study of embeddedness (Uzzi  1996, 1997) and the dissolution of market ties (Baker et al. 1998, Granovetter  1985; Seabright et al. 1992; Burt 1992; Fligstein 1996). The processes of disso-  lution and preservation of the target firm’s embedded ties observed in our study  cannot be satisfactorily entirely explained through rationalistic considerations,  1188 Organization Studies 28(08)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   whatever their nature (economic, strategic, organizational or cultural). They rely  on the participants’ interpretations of new sets of circumstances and situations  and on their adaptive responses and behaviours. In other words, they rely on  sensemaking (Weick 1995). Recent contributions in acquisition studies have  shown that acquisitions processes, with their intrinsic complexity and ambiguity,  are especially affected by the coexistence of rationality and irrationality in deci-  sion making (Vaara 2002, 2003). Our findings expand on these earlier contribu-  tions by suggesting that interpretive processes occurring outside the organizational  boundaries of the parent-target dyad are also important for understanding acqui-  sitions and their effects.  Conclusions  Before summing up the contribution offered by our findings on the dynamics of  embedded ties to both theory and practice, we would like to reflect on the key  limitations of the study and their potential significance. Two main problems  relate, respectively, to the small number of embedded relationships analysed  and to the particular nature of the acquisition cases selected as contexts for our  investigation. As for the small number of embedded ties under study, we believe  that the need to increase their number was counterbalanced by the equally legit-  imate need, given the exploratory stage of this research, to develop appropriate  methodological tools and to guarantee depth in analysis. In preferring depth to  breadth, we have exposed ourselves to criticism, but we have also strengthened  our chances of providing a methodological and conceptual platform for further,  larger-scale, studies. With regard to the decision to limit our investigation to  acquisitions motivated by growth and expansion, we acknowledge that this  might pose some issues of generalizability. Again, however, the exploratory  nature of the research and the need to pay significant attention to issues of  methodological development and depth of analysis constitute, in our view, legit-  imate reasons for our decision to curtail in some ways the complexity of the  empirical setting for the study.  Despite its inevitable and obvious limits, we believe that our research offers con-  tributions, i.e. new insights for both theory development and managerial practice,  and represents a useful starting point for future research in many directions. First,  our findings corroborate and expand extant theory on embeddedness (Uzzi 1996,  1997) in two main areas. First, they complement it by concentrating on the over-  looked processes of embeddedness dissolution and by identifying the dynamics  that underlie the transformation of an embedded tie into an arm’s length one.  Second, they expand it by highlighting the decisive role in this transformation,  besides changes in the social structural antecedents and the components of embed-  dedness, of specific tie contingencies. Our study partially corroborates the litera-  ture on the dissolution of market ties (Baker et al. 1998; Granovetter 1985;  Seabright et al. 1992; Burt 1992; Fligstein 1996) by confirming the importance of  social and institutional forces, power asymmetries and competition in the study of  tie dynamics. Our findings, however, point to different roles played by these forces  when applied to the processes of dissolution and preservation of embedded ties,  Spedale et al.: Target Firm Ties in Acquisitions 1189   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   thereby raising new questions to be addressed in future research. Our research  also promotes theory development in the field of acquisition studies. At a broader  level, it supports the view that acquisition studies can benefit from incorporating  a sensemaking and interpretive perspective (Weick 1995; Vaara 2003, 2003;  Vlaar et al. 2006) within more rationalistic considerations relating to strategic,  organizational, human and cultural aspects. The importance of interpretive  processes also mitigates the over-rationalistic approach that characterizes extant  literature on embeddedness and on the dissolution of market ties. At a more spe-  cific level, our study opens new lines of enquiry within this field by showing how  interpretive processes occurring beyond the boundaries of the parent–target dyad  have an impact on the target firm’s network portfolio.  Finally, we believe that our study clearly supports the importance of rela-  tional elements in acquisition studies. Starting from the methodological and  conceptual platform provided here, future research could explore a number of  potentially interesting issues. We would like to highlight a few. An important  development could be the application of extant ideas on the value of external  and internal knowledge (Menon and Pfeffer 2003) to acquisitions and, in par-  ticular, to the parent firm’s attitude to knowledge embedded in both the parent  firm and its network portfolio before and after integration. Future research  could also connect our study with theory developments on the social capital of  brokerage (Burt 1992, 2000, 2002). Bridges across structural holes provide  advantages in terms of information arbitrage and the early detection and devel-  opment of opportunities (Burt 2004). We suggest that the target firm’s embed-  ded ties provide this function for the parent firm, and their dissolution or  preservation might affect its innovative potential in significant ways. Other  important developments lie in connecting the dissolution or preservation of the  target firm’s embedded ties with a number of critical organizational dimensions  already identified in the literature review, such as, for example, knowledge and  learning (Kogut 2000; Uzzi and Lancaster 2003; Hansen 1999), absorptive  capacity (Van den Bosch et al. 1999; Jansen et al. 2005), the quality of strategic  decision making (Beckman and Haundschild 2002). Finally, although we con-  centrate on acquisitions motivated by growth and expansion, the study of other  types of acquisitions should not be overlooked. For example, in R&D acquisi-  tions, research has concentrated on knowledge exchange mainly between parent  and target firms with a focus on the factors that facilitate effective knowledge  transfer, such as communication, time elapsed since acquisition, and the knowl-  edge articulability (Ha°kanson 1995; Bresman et al. 1999). But, as the literature  on knowledge exchange between corporate and subsidiary levels in the context  of multinational companies already suggests (Andersson et al. 2001), relational  aspects might be an important element to add to the discussion.  As for managerial implications, we would like to emphasize the following  points. First and foremost, managerial decisions taken during the acquisition  process have effects that go beyond those immediately intended. A deeper under-  standing of these direct and indirect consequences might prevent managers from  running unnecessary risks, such as that of disrupting a potentially valuable source  of competitive advantage embedded in the target firm’s network portfolio.  Moreover, when engaging in acquisition processes, managers should be more  aware of the importance of relational elements and should pay to them the same  1190 Organization Studies 28(08)   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 22, 2009 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   Spedale et al.: Target Firm Ties in Acquisitions 1191  Note  References  attention they usually pay to strategic, organizational and process considerations.  Finally, managers should also recognize the importance of interpretive processes,  alongside rationality, in many dimensions of organizational life. In the course of  acquisition processes, interpretive processes that occur at the interface between  the target firm and its network portfolio are decisive in determining the future of  these important relations, with all that ensues in terms of the potential benefits (or  losses) for the parent and target firms (see Figure 1). This paper clarifies some of  the complexities associated with the challenge to manage parallel integration  processes, and invites both managers and researchers to pursue further the key  issue of integration with one important suggestion: integration does not only  occur within the organizational boundaries of the target–parent dyad, but includes  parts of its external environment. It is, indeed, triads — if not entire networks —  that matter.

Later,  as the director of research he helped transform that school into one of France’s top  schools of commerce. Roland co-authored 5 books and was involved in the writing of  over 50 journal articles. He organized the 2001 EGOS colloquium in Lyon and was  preparing to assume the editor-in-chief responsibilities of Organization Studies in 2003.  Roland was also known for his active interest in companies and for the help he gave  to executives in consulting and training sessions. Roland was also a tremendous  supporter of LRP.   c 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.  The Editor writes:  It was with great sadness that we learned that Roland Calori died suddenly a year ago, on Bastille  Day, 14 July 2002, at the age of 50. He was an active supporter of LRP both as board member  and contributor of many articles including two in the first two years of my tenure as editor. He  also was a wonderful character, friend to many and an intellectual stalwart of the strategy and  management community not just in France but world wide.  Roland had so many endearing qualities. Unusual among many academics, he was deeply inter-  ested in both business problems and ideas. He was an intellectual, a great consultant, and a man  with talent and a capacity for organising. But he was modest, fun loving, and a generous mentor  especially to junior faculty.  At the last board meeting it was agreed that we should remember Roland in some special way  by printing a short article that consists of a compilation of contributions from individuals close  to him who also have an association with LRP. These show the serious and playful sides of his  character. He was a truly Florentine man, intellectual, scholarly, talented in conversation, respected  by those who worked for him, a pillar for people to lean on, and dearly loved by his friends. And  he had some artistry too, and so at the end of this piece I reproduce a cartoon he drew for me  one summer after a visit to the desert together with our two Dutch colleagues Henk and Frans.  0024-6301/03/$ - see front matter  c 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.  doi:10.1016/S0024-6301(03)00036-0  Roland Calori at his desk in EM Lyon  Professor Frans A. J. Van den Bosch writes:  I will remember Roland Calori as an example of uncommon scholarship that may inspire us. As  I see it, his scholarship was not limited to getting “hits in A-journals” but he also gave his time  and energy to people that asked for his advice and friendship. He clearly lacked the “calculative  behaviour” we all hate.  I will briefly reflect on one aspect of his scholarship that attracts me in particular: the dynamics  of his intellectual curiosity. I will illustrate my observation by applying Mintzberg’s Ten Schools  of Thought in Strategy Formation on a selection of Roland’s publications that he wrote in the  period 1985–2002. By so doing, it becomes clear how his curiosity changed from a more prescrip-  tive to a more descriptive approach and how Roland moved through the Schools of Thought over  time. Each of these Schools of Thought focuses on a particular aspect of the strategy formation  process. The first three of the ten Schools are prescriptive, emphasizing how the strategy formation  process should be done. The next six Schools are descriptive and emphasize how strategy formation  may take place. The last and tenth School is labelled the Configuration School.  One of Roland’s first publications in an international scientific journal was in LRP on Effective  Strategies in Emerging Industries.1 Together with his other contributions to LRP, and in particular  the paper on Designing a Business Scanning System,2 these papers can be linked to the prescriptive  schools, that is the Design-, Planning-, and Positioning School. In the early nineties, Roland pub-  lished a paper on Entrepreneurial High Growth Companies and a series of papers including a  nice book in 1994 on European Management.3 These publications are clearly associated with the  Entrepreneurial School and the Cultural School in particular. In the Cultural School strategy for-  mation is conceived as a collective process.  During the nineties Roland shifted his perspective and developed a preference for the Cognitive  School in which strategy formation as a mental process is central. He published with various co-  authors on the topic of Managing Mergers Across Borders and on Nationally Bound Administrative  Heritage.4 An early example of his interest in the Cognitive School is his co-authored publication  on CEO’s Cognitive Maps and the Scope of the Organization in the Strategic Management Journal.5  He developed these ideas further in his paper on Philosophizing on Strategic Management Models  in Organization Studies.6 In this contribution he questioned on their own terrain the rational  modellers of strategy formation—the Design, Planning and Positioning Schools. In one of his  main conclusions he pointed out that: “Philosophizing is questioning, from which managers and  Roland Calori: A Special Tribute306  scholars can learn reflectivity which is the ability to be critical or suspicious of one’s intellectual  assumptions” (Calori, 1998:301). He recommended that we take into account socio-political  approaches and the perspective of “strategy as a discourse”. By so doing, Roland emphasized the  importance of the Power School with its emphasis on negotiated strategy formation and of the  Learning School. In the Learning School, strategy formation is conceived of as an emergent process.  In one of his last publications, in Organization on Organizational Development and the Ontology  of Creative Dialectical Evolution, Roland invited us to stretch towards both philosophy and prac-  titioners lay theories.7 Roland emphasized that if executives consider reality as a continuous devel-  opment—a creative “dialectical evolution”—they create the conditions for organizational develop-  ment. In such a perspective, executives do not consider organizational development as something  to be planned or to be designed. He pointed out that “managers who have internalized the prin-  ciples of creative dialectical evolution will design organizational forms and conduct strategy debates  in a way that enhances knowledge integration and consequently organizational development. In  so doing, they will create the conditions of meta flexibility.” (Calori, 2002:147)  In this sequence of Schools of Thought in Strategy Formation what is missing up till now is  the Environmental School and the Configurational School. I personally think Roland implicitly  disliked the Environmental School in which strategy formation is considered to be a reactive  process: his temperament and view on life contradicted such a passive approach. Looking back  on Roland’s Odyssey through the various Schools of Thought in Strategy Formation, I think I  would like to characterize and remember him as a fine example of a supporter of a “Configuration  School” in which strategy formation is considered as a process of transformation, encompassing  all the other Schools but each School taking in it’s own philosophical context. Having achieved  such a reflectivity is an important attribute of real scholarship, which at present is still uncommon.  Roland, thanks for your contributions.  Mike Lubatkin, University of Connecticut writes:  Professor Roland Calori died July 14th last year, ironically the day marking Independence in  France. He was only a few days shy of his 51st birthday. Roland was a world-renowned manage-  ment scholar.  Roland, Philippe Very, Jack Veiga and I teamed up to write some very good papers. I feel blessed  to have had the opportunity to work with a scholar with such boundless energy, penetrating  insights, and deserved reputation. I smile when I think about the epic battles that we had, many  over the trans-Atlantic phone lines, as he stubbornly held fast to his views about the direction of  our research, and I, of course, held fast to my views. And, I smile when I think about seeing him  one morning at 5am, standing outside my locked office door, with a donut in each hand, anxiously  waiting to access my computer. He wanted to try a particular statistical model that he had thought  of a few hours before, which had kept him awake, and which ended up serving as the breakthrough  model that made sense of all of our data.  Roland Calori was one of my dearest and closest friends. He and Marjia welcomed my wife  and I when we first arrived in France on the 28th of December in 1991, and treated us to a New  Year’s dinner 3 days later. Each summer when I returned to EM Lyon to teach my course, Roland  would drive me to his country home in Pollionnay where we would spend the weekends together.  We’d talk for hours about papers, children, parenting, and about life. We’d tell jokes and laugh—  and for those of you who knew Roland, you knew that he loved to laugh. We’d go for long walks,  get lost, and return back to his home just in time to enjoy the delicious dinner that Marjia had  spent the morning preparing. I will miss those times, and I will miss my friend. He was the good,  nurturing father of his two sons, Marc and Paul, and the committed husband of his wife, Marjia.  He was a man who celebrated life and welcomed those around him to join in his celebration.  Long Range Planning, vol 36 2003 307  Gerry Johnson, University of Strathclyde writes:  Roland was Renaissance man. His contributions varied from the hard end of strategy to insightful  philosophy; and in whichever mode he delivered penetrative insight. He was also determined.  When he had a goal in mind he did not let it go. One of my early collaborations with Roland  was on a paper for the Strategic Management Journal. The reviewers’ comments for the first draft  were discouraging but Roland was for seeing it through. He persuaded me to meet in Paris to  “give it a go” which is what we did for three days, working and reworking the arguments. The  paper was published.  He was also supportive. Colleagues could rely on his reliable and enthusiastic support when  they needed it. And not just established academics. At the first conference one of my past PhD  students attended she found herself sitting at dinner with a group of senior professors. The unfam-  iliarity of the situation was compounded by the jockeying amongst the professors for the high  ground, which left her with nothing to say and no-one noticing her discomfort. Unlike the other  professors, Roland did notice. “He talked of how he had always thought it best that PhD students  sit under trees in their university grounds in summer and play with ideas. Somehow this moved  on to talking about my research. This left me with an imprint of the joy of academic life I always  like to recall.”  Working with Roland usually meant that you came away with some new insight or new perspec-  tive, not just because of the discussions themselves, but the way they occurred. In the mid nineties  Roland prompted, sometimes organised and always attended, a small group of academics, formed  as the antidote to large and formal management conferences. This was just a few of us who met  to discuss academic matters from very different points of view, without papers, without scripts,  relying on intellects, friendship and, of course, good food, good wine and the occasional amble  through the countryside. We took lessons from Roland on how to listen to others. He occupied  the position that more often than not people had something interesting to say and that, by allowing  them the space to say it, their contributions would emerge. This required patience, good humour  and absence of academic posturing which we all know are the rare qualities which Roland had  and so many of us do not.  Roland also saw the good in people, rather than assume the worst or focus on their weakness.  He therefore drew out the best in people. Again this could be academics, but it might be anyone  else he met. At the Academy of Management Conference in 1993 Roland’s hotel was in downtown  Atlanta. He arrived late in the evening, but jetlagged as he was, wanted some air and went for a  walk—not the most advisable thing to do in downtown Atlanta. On his way back to the hotel a  large and dishevelled hustler jumped out of an alleyway and demanded Roland give him $10.  Roland had only just arrived from the airport where he had changed his francs. He only had large  denomination notes. Placing his cigarette in the corner of his mouth Roland pulled out a roll of  notes, and asked the guy if he had change for a $100 bill. Out of sheer shock, and hearing Roland’s  accent, the hustler asked Roland where he was from. In his broadest French, Roland explained he  was from Lyon. “But that’s where my family is from” replied the hustler. “Really” replies Roland  and they strike up a conversation. A few minutes later Roland is to be found buying the guy a  beer and chatting about France. This is Roland. I doubt it would happen to many others.  Roland took sheer joy in all that he did and was a joy to be with. I, like others, wanted to work  with Roland, not just because he was a good academic and a good colleague, but because it was  a joy to do so. It was not just because he knew how to mix work and pleasure—and he did. It  was because working and being with Roland made you feel good. I have also come to realize that  in this academic world, which can be so vain and shallow, it is also possible to meet real friendship.  I will miss Roland as an academic colleague but most of all as a dear, dear friend.  Leif Melin, Jönköping International Business School, writes:  Roland Calori was a true strategic management scholar. In all his outstanding research he contrib-  uted with new empirical accounts, theoretical perspectives and conclusions that helped establish  Roland Calori: A Special Tribute308  a European school of strategy. Some would say that during the last five years he left the strategy  field moving into pure organization theory studies. I think this interpretation is too limited, rather,  Roland Calori opened up totally new perspectives for understanding strategic development, renewal  and leadership.  In his most recent articles and papers, Roland Calori developed an innovative framework on  organizational learning and knowledge creation through taking in and translating concepts from  philosophy and social theory. His ambition was to increase our understanding of becoming and  the role of dialogue in strategic renewal processes. He introduced new concepts such as “creative  dialectic evolution”, combining work of two philosophers, Bergson on creative evolution and Mer-  leau-Ponty on hyperdialectics, thereby opening up a new agenda for innovative strategizing. In  what became his last, unfinished work, he further developed his new framework through emphasiz-  ing the organizations capacity for explorative learning, especially in conditions of diversity. Here  he extended the meaning of March’s exploration concept through focusing on why and how to  engage organizational members on many levels in explorative dialogues, based on Habermas “com-  municative action” and Aristotle’s “deliberation” and “open argumentation”.  I had the advantage of working closely with Roland in different research endeavours over the  last 15 years, which gave me the great experience of participating with him in many challenging,  intellectual journeys. Collaboration with Roland meant benefiting from his constructive,  demanding and rigorous input in our research dialogues. At the same time, the hard, energetic  and professional work was always combined with the importance of having a good time. He  enjoyed the hedonistic aspects of modern life such as excellent food and wine, followed by classic  blues music, at blues bars at different conference venues around the world. In whatever context  you met Roland you always experienced his warmth, his humour, his humility and his empathy.  Roland, you left us much too early. But we will continue to “interact” with you, feeling your  complex and human personality both when reading your texts and when listening to the blues  you liked!  Tugrul Atamer, Strategic Management Department EM-Lyon writes:  I wrote three books and numerous articles with Roland after he recruited me in 1986 at EM Lyon.  We shared a common passion for our profession sometimes through consultant projects, some-  times through research projects and finally for building up an international strategic management  team at EM Lyon. He became my close friend, almost my brother. Roland will not only be remem-  bered for his deep human warmth and friendship, for the extraordinary contact he established  with students in his classes, but also for the wealth and variety of intellectual excellence that he  brought to his teaching and research. Although rooted in his native Mediterranean land, Roland  was open to other cultures. I remember the day when we flew to Milan to visit Bocconi in 1989,  with the idea of building up a research community in Europe. This was the starting point of the  Modem Group that teamed up 16 people from 8 countries and led to the creation of the book  about the specificity of European Management.  Roland had a special ability to orchestrate a network of people coming from different countries.  Sometimes the personality of all these international network members was so different, misunder-  standings and miscommunications created so much tensions that I still wonder how they survived.  The magic was Roland’s diplomacy. At the hottest moment of the meeting he knew when exactly  to call a coffee break. Over the coffee break he knew how to fix problems and reduce tensions  by diplomacy.  Roland rejected extremism both in research and in everyday life, because he felt that reality  could be built around a movement of perpetual dialectic. An open ear to all the vagaries of opinion  was better than a hermetic fixed view. For Roland, strategic management was all about managing  this dialectic and integrating these subtleties. Roland believed that excellence was the fusion of  passion and pleasure. The true value of his legacy lies in this ability to have been perpetually  innovative in his ideas, guided by a unique and very strong principle of humanism.  Long Range Planning, vol 36 2003 309  Philippe Very, Professor of Edhec Business School, France writes:  Roland you were surely the one of the best-known French professors in strategic management in  the world, well known for your research and human qualities. You recruited me at EM Lyon  when I was a doctoral student and quickly involved me in ambitious research projects. In many  circumstances, you generated such a momentum that I was obliged to make progress. In the first  years that I followed you, I tried to avoid being outrun. You gave me ten days to create a list of  company CEOs to interview and asked me to write a consulting report late in the evening for the  next day’s meeting with the company executives! I helped you organise a conference where you  decided we should do everything ourselves. I remember running behind you on Stockholm’s side-  walks on a dark and rainy night where you endlessly searched for a good Blues Band concert. It  was a learning race. Learn about the job, the blues bands and so many other things... I never  succeeded in catching you up.  We conducted twelve years of research together, forged by close friendship between us and with  our offices separated only by a simple glass wall. You inspired respect as one deeply appreciated  by your peers. You proposed to read articles before others such as I sent them to journals. You  encouraged and gave advice over teaching. You always gave your best to the Business School,  meeting partners, organising big events and preparing reports.  You loved being with your friends, discovering new people and new cultures. You welcomed  visiting professors, exploring and discussing new ideas. I hope you get some rest now. Recently,  after a French colloquium, we were lying back in comfortable desk-chairs, a glass of Pastis in one  hand, speaking of our families, telling jokes in Marseille slang. We both loved your native town.  It was a lot of fun. Laughing like two young teenagers. I appreciated these moments as I think  you did.  Then you suddenly ran to take a taxi for the train station. No surprise. You left us at the dawn  of your 51st year. Is this your last joke? Because “51” is the brand name of the Pastis we used to  sip together.

Corporate  Relocating  Anywhere  Rotterdam  or   HQ  Offshoring is the buzz concept of the   noughties. But no matter how much the   material business is diverted to other   countries or even continents, headquarters   are invariably located where the company   originated – sometimes in out-of-the way   towns and small cities.   But, as Marc Baaij, Douglas van den Berghe,   Frans van den Bosch and Henk Volberda   point out, there are many cases where the   case for relocating headquarters is excellent.   So why doesn’t it happen? Is it inertia,   operational difficulty – or just that the   companies haven’t thought of it?   T he paradox of the global corporation is thatwhile most value adding activities relocatewhen the environment is right for change,  the activities of the headquarters remain at their  original location. A glance at the Fortune Global  500 corporations reveals that only one cross-border  relocation took place in the decade from 1994 to  2003: the Chrysler headquarters, relocated from the  US to Germany in 1998 after the cross-border  acquisition by the German firm Daimler.  This is the exception that proves the rule. Most  companies appear to believe that the activities  taking place at the headquarters are exempt from  the forces of internationalisation. But this is strange  when one considers that otherwise,  internationalisation forces are so all-pervasive. The  first element of the corporation to internationalise  was sales, then manufacturing. Currently, we are in  the midst of the internationalisation of activities of  higher added value – research and development and  corporate services, to take two examples.   The lowering, or even elimination, of trade and  investment barriers combined with the increasing  sophistication of ICT and transportation  technologies enables corporations to slice up their  value chain of activities more finely. They can then  optimise the geographical location of each  individual value adding activity.   With the ability to make activities mobile and  cross-country wholesale moves so necessary, and so  effective, why have corporate headquarters  remained untouched by the forces of  internationalisation? Changing the location of the  other activities isn’t without consequences for the  chain of command and control of the corporation –  i.e., the corporate headquarters. Having optimised  the locations of their value adding activities,  corporations now need to reconsider the location of  their command and control activities.   The fact is, central HQ may not be in the right  place. And although this is can be an earth-  shattering concept for employees, it is one that  should be considered like any other rational  business decision.   We are therefore on the brink of a next stage of  corporate internationalisation. The relocation of   the untouchable headquarters can be regarded as  the ultimate act of global strategy. The question  now is – how do we decide where the headquarters  should be?   From here to eternity  The starting point is to consider the traditional  check list of HQ site selection criteria:     Corporate tax advantages     Investment incentives     Investment climate    Company law     Operational costs     Quality, availability and costs of the workforce    Quality of living (major hotels and restaurants,  proximity of quality housing, cultural life and  recreation, quality of schools, cultural diversity,  safety, crime and health factors, personal taxes,  cost of living etc.)     Level of infrastructure (in particular  transportation, communication and IT)     Level of high-level business services (e.g.  accounting, legal and management consulting)     Sufficient representative office space     The presence of other major corporations.   The main benefit of this list is not to find suitable  sites, but to eliminate unsuitable ones. Once these  factors have been assessed, more strategic criteria for  the right headquarters location can be considered.   All I want is a place somewhere  To analyse the strategic motives for relocating  headquarters, we need to consider HQ in a radically  new light. What we currently call the headquarters  is actually three different entities:     The minimum headquarters    The value-adding function     The shared services headquarters.   The three have different location criteria. So if we  reconsider HQ in this way, we can more effectively  consider relocation.  The minimum headquarters consists of the  statutory seat of the corporation and includes  activities such as legal compliance, tax and  financial reporting, financial control and internal  audit and investor relations. It is the core and non-  discretionary part of the headquarters.   The value-adding function is core as well, but it is  also discretionary. It is defined as providing  strategic guidance for the businesses, building and  Summer 2005 Rotterdam or anywhereBusiness Strategy Review46  Tr  en  ds  The relocation of the untouchable headquarters can be  regarded as the ultimate act of global strategy. The  question now is – how do we decide where the  headquarters should be?  leveraging corporate-wide competences, and  facilitating synergies between the businesses.   The third part, the shared services, is also  discretionary – but non-core. These elements happen  to rest within the corporate headquarters because of  economies of scale, scope or specialisation.  Should I stay or should I go?  So where should the parts of the headquarters go  to? The shared services part is the most mobile  element of the headquarters. It does not need to be  close to the business. These services can be off-  shored or even outsourced as they are both non-core  and discretionary.   As is now familiar, corporations relocate their  shared services primarily for efficiency reasons.  Common examples are relocating IT activities to  India and administrative services to Eastern Europe.  The main criteria are: cost, quality, and flexibility of  labour; cost and quality of the IT infrastructure; and  tax advantages.  For corporations that relocate their shared  services, economic and political risk, country  infrastructure and cultural compatibility are all  important considerations.   In contrast, the value adding function – the second  of our three parts – needs to be located near the  business end of the corporation. Originally, the value  adding headquarters was conveniently located at the  site of the value adding activities of the corporation.  However, with the relocation of the value adding  activities, the original location of the headquarters  becomes out of sync with the rest of the value chain.  The value-adding headquarters should, therefore,  follow the corporation’s centre of gravity.   In high-tech industries, the value-adding  headquarters needs to be close to the R&D  activities. If R&D relocates to an industry cluster,  the value-adding headquarters should join them. An  example is Pharmacia & Upjohn, which relocated  from London to the cluster of pharmaceutical  industries in New Jersey in 1999.  And in manufacturing industries, the value-adding  headquarters needs to be near manufacturing. If  manufacturing relocates to the largest and most  important market, the value-adding headquarters  should follow.   If the corporation diversifies into other  businesses, the value-adding headquarters might be  torn in different directions – but it should follow its  centre of gravity. The value-adding headquarters  may need to relocate from its original location to a  more central location within the expanded corporate  space – as Boeing did when it moved from Seattle  to Chicago in 2001. Chicago was centrally located  for Boeing’s corporate portfolio of commercial  areoplanes, military aircraft and missile systems,  and space and communications.   But the first of our three thirds – the minimum  headquarters – does not need to be near the value  adding activities because it primarily fulfils a legal  and financial role. If the value adding activities have  been relocated abroad, the minimum headquarters  will typically relocate from the former location of the  value adding activities to a major metropolitan  centre within the home country. Because of its  financial role, the minimum headquarters should be  close to the financial markets.   International financial clusters such as London   will be attractive for the minimum headquarters.  Access to high level business services and the  proximity of other major corporations would also   be useful.  When two become one  There are three other strategic motives that can  affect the location decision of both minimum  headquarters and value-adding headquarters.    Mergers and acquisitions     Internationalisation of leadership and ownership    Strategic renewal.   When companies of equal size merge, they need to  find a neutral location for the headquarters of the  merged corporation. In 1987, ASEA from Västerås  in Sweden and BBC Brown Boveri of Baden,  Switzerland merged to create ABB Asea Brown  Boveri. The new headquarters were not situated in  either original location, but in Zurich.   In the case of acquisitions, the obvious solution is  the most effective – the new headquarters is that of  the acquirer, and the acquired corporation relocates  (e.g. DaimlerChrysler).  Our second motive – internationalisation of  leadership and ownership – makes corporations less  sensitive to national sentiments or ties to a specific  country. Foreign board executives and shareholders  will be less attached to the traditional home  country, and less likely to resist a cross-border  relocation of the headquarters.   Our final reason for relocating headquarters is  strategic renewal. This was a key reason for Philips  Electronics’ relocation to Amsterdam after 106  years of emotional ties to Eindhoven, the town  where Philips was founded. Relocation can be a  Business Strategy ReviewRotterdam or anywhere Summer 2005 47     Tr  en  ds  In contrast to startups, established corporations have to  deal with a legacy.  mechanism of change as it symbolises a fresh  start and a break with the past.   I want to break free  The reasons for relocating headquarters are sound –  so why is it still only a handful of small companies  who have taken headquarters relocation as an option?  Part of the reason is the number of barriers that exist  to impede relocation. In contrast to startups,  established corporations have to deal with a legacy. In  the past, investments have been made that tie the  headquarters to its current location. Corporations may  suffer from locational inertia – that is, the extent to  which the current location determines subsequent  investment in the same location.   National or regional legislation also impedes  relocation. These barriers are there for good social  reasons, such as the protection of local economies  and the protection of jobs, especially where a region  is reliant on the industry that wants to relocate. But  in many countries, especially in the EU, the barriers  are coming down. While this has significant social  implications that are not the remit of this article,  the fact is that things are changing and so  companies can consider headquarters relocation  more realistically than in the past.  Across the EU the situation is still complicated  and it can be very expensive to relocate the  statutory seat of a corporation from one member  state to another. However, the European Commission  is currently working on an Action Plan on modernising  company law which will enable cross-border  mobility of corporate headquarters within the EU.   As a result, cross-border relocation will become  more and more appetising to companies  contemplating the move. Shared services, being   the most mobile part, will relocate first. The  minimum headquarters and the value-adding  function will be the next candidates for  international relocation, each part according to its  own strategic criteria.   A song for Europe  We have already observed relocation of shared  services to Eastern Europe and India. As soon as   the European Commission’s Action Plan is  implemented, we may well find more examples of  international mobility of the other two parts of the  headquarters, the value-adding function and the  minimum headquarters.   Both European management and European  governments need to anticipate these upcoming  developments. If a large number of companies start  to shift, it could have significant consequences for  national and regional economies – both positive and  negative. It could be Rotterdam or anywhere – so  have your parachute handy, just in case.

Kriger  The European financial services sector is confronted with major forces that have  changed its competitive dynamics and the strategic context. Firstly, we investigate the  pace of the diffusion of two forces for strategic renewal (technological innovations and  regulatory changes); secondly, we assess similarities in the pace of diffusion across  countries; and thirdly, we assess the impact of these developments on the European  financial landscape, focusing on five EU countries from 1990 to 1999. Preliminary  findings suggest that country-specific patterns of diffusion have decreased substantially,  indicating the emergence of industry-generic patterns of diffusion, while the speed of  diffusion is increasing within the sector. This will give rise to a hyper-competitive  landscape in the beginning of this century. Understanding the emergence of such  landscapes creates important managerial challenges for the strategic renewal journeys  of both incumbent firms and new entrants, in the financial services sector and in  sectors confronted with similar developments.  c 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The Changing Landscape of Financial Services180  agers—in both the financial services sector and other sectors con-  fronted with similar questions—to increase their understanding  of the challenges for strategic renewal posed by newly emerg-  ing landscapes.  Although there are many different forces, we focus on two of  these here, building on and extending the work of other scholars1  by trying to empirically assess the speed of diffusion of the  changes triggered by these forces. On the basis of this analysis  we indicate future changes in the European financial services  landscape2 which may challenge managers to think about the  viability and necessity of generic European versus country-spe-  cific renewal strategies.  This article is structured as follows: firstly, we briefly point out  the process of increasing globalisation in financial services. We  then focus on the European Union and investigate the pace of  the diffusion of regulatory changes and technological develop-  ments as two major forces3 that enable strategic renewal in  France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom.  The results show patterns of national divergence regarding dif-  fusion in which the Netherlands and the UK are first movers.  The results also indicate a movement towards similar and  increasing speeds of diffusion across the countries investigated,  suggesting an emerging convergence in the European financial  services landscape. We conclude by pointing out the expected  changes in the European financial services landscape beyond  2000.  Although this article focuses on European industry- and  national-level changes, we present six small cases to illustrate the  impact of these changes on particular financial services firms.  An example of how regulatory and technological forces affect a  company’s strategic renewal process is illustrated in Exhibit 1 by  the case of Italy’s Banca Intesa.  Globalisation in the financial services sector  Although this article focuses on the European financial services  sector, it is important to point out the growing global interde-  pendence of regional financial services sectors as illustrated by  the recent Asian crisis, which painfully uncovered global interde-  pendencies between financial systems. Major financial players try  to cope with these interdependencies by globalising their activi-  ties: for example, large US banks like Citigroup are making  inroads into Europe, Japanese banks have entered US markets,  and European players are increasing their intercontinental oper-  ations by penetrating American (for instance, the Deutsche  Bank) and Asian markets. Almost one-third of the largest finan-  cial services firms in the world have businesses in three or more  continents.4 ING is a recent example of a European financial  services firm penetrating Japan by taking a stake in a Japanese  commercial bank. Increasing cross-border trade is another sign  of globalisation.  Figure 1 presents data on cross-border trade in financial ser-  Exhibit 1.

Total net profit over 1999 accumulated to   853  million; total assets by the end of 1999 were   305 billion and its  market capitalisation was   25.8 billion by 8 April, 2000.  The changes in the financial services sector greatly impacted on  the development and growth of Banca Intesa. The European-wide  challenges posed by the Internet, the EU push towards  consolidation and the highly fragmented market in Italy ‘forced’  Banca Intesa to adopt a specific growth model. This so-called  ‘federative’ model was based on a bottom-up process of soft  integration, without drastic reorganisations and bitter cost-cutting  programs. A large degree of operational autonomy was granted to  the banks that joined Intesa. Internal forces amplified the drive to a  federative model. Intesa’s president, Giovanni Bazoli, together with  Carlo Salvatori, now CEO of Banca Intesa, experimented with a  bottom-up, inclusive and consensus-oriented approach aimed at  pulling otherwise reluctant small local banks into Intesa’s reach,  thus successfully managing dozens of friendly acquisitions and  considerable growth.  Today, Banca Intesa is the largest bank in Italy with a network  of more than 4,000 branches and over 70,000 employees. This  success is mainly due to the rapid growth pattern driven by the  federative model. However, as the competition increases and  financial institutions no longer compete on the national level but  on a European or even global scale, the pressure is being felt  from within. Intesa’s shareholders are increasingly demanding  better financial results and a more efficient firm.  This is forcing the management to abandon the federative  strategy in favour of a more effective integration process. The  new strategic plan released in May 2000 calls for a fully fledged  divisional banking model based on closer customer focus, rather  than on pampering to traditional shareholders’ political interests.  The distribution strategy will move from the traditional branch-  based model towards a multi-channel approach, with an  ambitious   775 million investment plan for e-banking. The  integration strategy of Intesa’s latest acquisition BCI has also been  deeply revised, and now aims at   1 billion worth of synergies, of  which about 50 per cent are expected from cost reduction, lay-  offs, and divestment of physical branches.  The top management of Intesa will be trying to cope with  these entirely new and much more painful strategic challenges  using the well-established inclusive and consensus-building  approach. Whether the old organisational process will work in the  new strategic context remains to be seen.  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 181  The Changing Landscape of Financial Services182  Figure 1.

The numbers represent the sum of the imports and exports  of cross-border financial service transactions (excluding  insurance) of Canada, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the  US. Figure 2 provides the financial value of net international  bank lending of the G10 countries, plus thirteen other nations.  The amount has tripled from a low of US$245 billion in 1992  to a high of US$875 billion in 1997. International bank lending  fell in 1998 as a consequence of the Asian crisis.  These developments suggest increasing pressures to globalise.  As it is beyond the scope of this article to discuss changes in the  global financial services landscape, we concentrate on changes in  five European Union countries, and focus on European-based  financial services firms. The next sections analyse changes in EU  regulations and technological developments, two major strategic  renewal-enabling forces having a significant impact on the Euro-  pean financial services landscape.  Country differences in the pace of diffusion of  changes in EU regulations  Until the mid-1980s, the European financial services sector was  characterised by significant governmental involvement and by  numerous institutional and regulatory limitations on the dom-  estic, cross-border and cross-sector activities of financial service  firms. The process of deregulation and harmonisation in the fin-  ancial services sector has been a gradual one and has varied con-  siderably between European countries. Of the numerous regulat-  Figure 2. Estimated net financing in international markets69  ory changes that have taken place, we focus here on three  categories of regulatory changes (see Table 1) aimed at:  1. eliminating restrictions on domestic competition;  2. changing the scale and scope of financial activities; and  3. improving the external competitive position of financial  firms.5  Obviously, these regulatory changes have a major impact on the  strategic renewal context of the firms involved.  The first category relates to the process of enhancing domestic  competition. This process includes the elimination of restrictions  on the entry of new domestic firms and restrictions on mergers  and acquisitions. It also includes the removal of limitations to  the use of competitive tools such as interest rate controls and  the loosening of controls on capital flows that limit foreign com-  petition.5 In connection with this, we compare dates in which  capital flows and interest rates6 were deregulated.  The second category of regulatory changes comprises indi-  cators on the relaxation of regulations that limit the scale and  scope of financial services. These include restrictions on cross-  border establishments and limits on combining banking,  insurance and securities activities within a single firm.5 The pro-  cess of increasing the scale and scope of financial activities is  estimated via the year of implementation of the first banking  Table 1.

The second banking directive includes a list of  financial activities that are subject to the single passport,7  although there are still differences across countries regarding the  extent to which a single firm is allowed to combine banking,  insurance and securities activities. We also indicate these differ-  ences.  The third category of regulatory changes shown in Table 1  applies to variations in regulations impacting the external com-  petitive position of financial firms. These include solvency regu-  lations, capital adequacy requirements, and reserve and invest-  ment coefficients. These measures impact on the cost of doing  business and place limits on the free use of deposits and a firm’s  own funds.5 We indicate this process by stating the implemen-  tation period of the harmonisation of prudential regulations  across the five countries. Table 1 presents the three categories of  regulatory changes. We will expand on these patterns below.  Eliminating restrictions to domestic competition  The upper part of Table 1 presents the year of the first mover  and the time lag in years of the other countries regarding the  deregulation of all interest rates and the full liberalisation of capi-  tal flows.8 The first mover regarding interest rate deregulation  was the UK (1979). Two years later this regulatory change took  place in the Netherlands, hence the figure of  2 years in Table  1. The UK also moved first in liberalising capital flows, closely  followed by the Netherlands. Compared to the UK and the  Netherlands, France and Italy lagged behind almost ten years in  both the deregulation of interest rates and the liberalisation of  capital flows. These late movers followed a more gradual policy  of deregulating interest rates and liberalising capital flows.6  The scope and scale of financial activities  Three directives have guided the deregulation process in the Eur-  opean financial services sector. The 1973 directive abrogated dis-  criminatory rules, aiming to prevent discrimination between  banks of European Community countries and national banks  concerning freedom of establishment and freedom of financial  institutions to provide self-employed activities.  The first banking directive was approved in 1977 and was  based on the principle of generalised harmonisation. It was  intended to facilitate the access and the activities of credit insti-  tutions in EC member states, and to eliminate the most  important legal impediments between member states.9  The second banking directive was issued in 1989 and consisted  of four principles, of which the single license principle is most  important. This principle allows banks that are authorised by one  of the EU member states to conduct a number of activities in  any other EU member state without having to be authorised by  the foreign member state.9 The middle part of Table 1 shows  that the UK and the Netherlands were the first to implement the  first banking directive, and they were also the first to eliminate  restrictions to domestic competition. France, which was late in  deregulating interest rates and liberalising capital flows, was how-  ever quick to implement the first banking directive. Sweden lags  behind in implementing the banking directives because of its late  entrance to the European Union.  With regard to combining financial activities, differences  between the five countries have been largely diminished. Cur-  rently, there are no substantial differences in combining banking  and insurance activities. There is some variation in the exploi-  tation of securities activities by banks, notably in Italy and the  United Kingdom. We illustrate the effect of permission to com-  bine banking and insurance activities with the case of ING in  Exhibit 2.  Exhibit 2. Deregulation in bank insurance: ING  ING has developed into a global integrated financial services  institution which is active in the field of banking, insurance and  asset management. Total net profit over 1999 accumulated to    4.922 million; total assets by the end of 1999 were   492.8 billion  and its market capitalisation was   58.1 billion by 1 May, 2000.  The direction in which the financial services sector moved in  the second half of the 1980s made it clear that the borders  between banking and insurance were becoming blurred. As a  result, the Dutch government lifted the ban on combining  banking and insurance activities on 1 January, 1990, and most  Dutch banking firms acted on this regulatory change by adding  insurance activities to their banking core.  The most drastic move, however, was the merger of Nationale  Nederlanden, Netherlands’ largest insurer, with the third largest  Dutch bank, NMB Postbank, to form the Internationale  Nederlanden Group (ING). Ten years later, banking and insurance  activities are still legally separated, as Dutch law requires a  separation of capital between those activities. However, ING’s  operational structure has diverged from its legal structure,  promoting cooperation between market segments. ING now  carries one brand name for various types of products. It markets  its product range through a wide range of distribution channels,  including its bank branches, independent agents and virtual  channels such as the Internet. By 1995, some 10 per cent of ING’s  total new domestic business came from sales through its 400  bank branches and its network of 2,100 post offices.  The emergence of financial conglomerates such as ING and the  development towards combining and offering formerly separated  financial products within one organisation has been beneficial to  customers, but troublesome for regulators. The Dutch supervisory  system, which was organised by sector, adapted itself and  founded the Board of Financial Supervisors in July 1999. The new  supervisory role, in which the three supervisors of the banking,  insurance and securities sectors are represented, adds a cross-  sector perspective to the sectoral model of supervision.  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 185  Not all countries  implemented the  Basle Accord in the  same manner  The Changing Landscape of Financial Services186  Harmonisation of prudential regulation  Prudential regulation aims to create a level playing field and to  set minimum requirements. It includes, amongst other things,  legislation on solvency ratios and the definition of own funds.5  The lower part of Table 1 indicates the time periods during  which this legislation was adopted across Europe. It shows that  the starting dates of the implementation process range between  1989 and 1991, with the notable exception of the United King-  dom, which had already started in 1985. Four countries finished  implementating prudential regulation in 1995, Italy having fin-  ished two years earlier.10 On July 1, 1988, the Basle Committee  on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices issued the  Basle Accord. This was enforced in two stages: an intermediate  stage at the end of 1990, coming into full effect by the end of  1992.  The minimal capital requirement of banks came to depend on  the perceived credit risk exposure of banks’ assets and their off-  balance-sheet positions.11 The main requirement is that inter-  nationally active banks should hold a minimum of 8 per cent  spare capital as security against default on their loans.12 These  higher capital requirements result in a limit to how much capital  can be put to work, potentially reducing shareholders’ returns.10  Not all countries implemented the Basle Accord in the same  manner. The UK, for instance, has a system of differential capital  requirements. Only the top banks are allowed to hold close to 8  per cent of risk-weighted assets, whilst most British banks are  required to hold between 10 and 18 per cent. Belgium and France  treat most established banks equally, although risky new banks  may be forced to hold more capital.10 Currently, the Basle Accord  is under review and, for European banks, this could imply that  banks should hold more capital if they are seen as risky. Regu-  lators will be given explicit powers to enforce the new require-  ments. The review may level the international playing field  between UK and continental banks, since the UK banks are  required to hold more capital than their continental competitors.  A second issue of potentially major consequence is that banks  may be required to use internal ratings to measure loan risk  weightings. Only banks with sophisticated risk management sys-  tems can have their internal risk rated. This puts smaller banks  at a disadvantage since such systems may well be too expensive  for them to build and maintain.10  Establishment of the European Monetary Union and the  introduction of the Euro  The culmination of the harmonisation of regulations across Eur-  ope is the establishment of the European Monetary Union  (EMU) and the introduction of the Euro. The Euro is being  introduced in several stages. The Euro system, consisting of the  European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks,  sets the monetary policy for the EMU. The ECB’s main task is  to maintain price stability within the Euro zone. The main impli-  cation of the Euro is the promotion of the single market. EU  banks can lend and borrow without any exchange or interest  risks, which encourages cross-border activities. The EMU further  increases price transparency across European markets. Compa-  nies are now urged to think and act on a European instead of  a national scale, which promotes not only cross-border mergers  and acquisitions, but also domestic ones in order to gain suf-  ficient scale.13  Country differences in the pace of diffusion of  technological developments  In this section we focus on a number of technological develop-  ments that enable the strategic renewal of incumbents and the  emergence of new entrants by having a major impact on the  interface between clients and financial services providers. Build-  ing on several previous contributions,14 we investigated the dif-  fusion of technological developments along five indicators:  1. the introduction of the first ATM network;  2. the first EFTPoS network;  3. the e-purse;  4. the introduction of remote banking facilities; and  5. the first branchless bank in a country.  Below we briefly describe each indicator and the diffusion pat-  terns across the five countries. Table 2 presents, for each of the  five indicators, the year of introduction of each technology and  the time lags between the first mover country and the followers.  ATM networks  The introduction of the first automated teller machine (ATM)  network in a country is our first indicator of technological devel-  opment. The first ATM network, ‘Bankomat’, was founded in  1972 in Sweden.15 Italy followed 11 years later with its ‘Bancom-  at’ network.16 In France, the Groupement Carte Bleue, together  with Crédit Agricole and Crédit Mutuel, created the Groupement  Table 2.

Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 187  Debit cards are much  more widely used in  Europe than in the  USA, making this a  better indicator for  technological  development  The Changing Landscape of Financial Services188  des Cartes Bancaires (CB) in 1984 and introduced ‘interbancari-  té’, allowing customers to use their cards at any ATM or EFTPoS  terminal that accepts the CB card.17 In the Netherlands, Rabob-  ank, ABN, AMRO, NMB and Van Lanschot formed an ATM  network in 1985,18 and in the UK the ‘Link’ network was  founded in 1986.19  EFTPoS networks  EFTPoS is our second indicator, described as “an electronic pay-  ment method involving goods and services being paid for at the  point of sale through electronic debit of the customer’s  account”.14 Debit cards are much more widely used in Europe  than in the USA, making this a better indicator for technological  development than, for instance, the introduction of the first cre-  dit card. We have already mentioned that the CB network in  France, founded in 1984, consists of both ATM and EFTPoS. In  Sweden, the Babs company was founded in 1985 to manage the  EFTPoS network in that country.20 The Italians started a national  EFTPoS experiment in 1986, establishing terminals which also  accepted Bancomat ATM cards.21 The UK’s first debit card pay-  ment system, Switch, was founded in 1988,22 and the Dutch did  not introduce their EFTPoS network ‘PIN’ until 1990.18  E-purse  The e-purse, a substitute for cash, is our third indicator. The e-  purse is a card containing a microchip that stores electronic  money, and can be combined with a debit card, for example.  The Netherlands was the first country to launch an e-purse trial  in the city of Woerden in 1989, and also the first to introduce  a nationwide e-purse scheme, called Chipknip, in 1996.23 Italy  followed with the introduction of ‘Cassamat’, a local e-purse  which was launched in 1994 in the district of Alto Adige by the  Raiffeisen federation of cooperative credit institutions. The  ‘Mondex’ card was introduced in the UK in 1995 with a trial  undertaken in Swindon. In Sweden, the nationwide e-purse  scheme ‘Cash Card’ was introduced in 1998 by a consortium  consisting of Nordbanken, Sparbanken and SEB. The e-purse  reached France when the Crédit Mutuel Group acquired the  license for the Mondex card—previously trialed in the UK—and  introduced it in Strasbourg in 1999.24 Although France was the  last country to introduce an e-purse, it was the first in using the  microchip technology in another way when, in 1992, the mag-  netic stripe on the Cartes Bancaires cards was replaced by a  microchip,25 resulting in a 90 per cent reduction in card fraud.26  Remote banking  The fourth indicator is remote banking, defined as managing  one’s account without physically going to a bank office. We have  divided remote banking into three different types: telephone  banking, PC banking and Internet banking.27 Telephone banking  allows one to manage one’s account by talking to a human oper-  ator or a computer (using voice response). In the literature, the  terms PC banking and Internet banking are sometimes called  online banking and are used interchangeably. However, we  define PC banking as banking by using a computer and a modem  to manage an account. The software is installed on the cus-  tomer’s computer, so the bank can only be contacted using this  particluar computer. With Internet banking, no specific software  needs to be installed, which implies that wherever the customer  has access to the Internet, he can manage his accounts.  Telephone banking  Telephone banking was first introduced in Sweden by Swedbank  in 1985.28 The other countries were much later in introducing  these services, ranging from four years (the UK) to ten years  (Italy). First Direct was the first to offer a complete banking ser-  vice in the UK via telephone, although Nationwide and Abbey  National had already had telephone services for some time.29  Cortal, a subsidiary of Paribas, introduced Finexpress in 1990.30  In the Netherlands, the Postbank (part of ING) started offering  a telephone banking service called Girofoon in 1993.31 Italy was  the last country to introduce telephone banking. Cariplo (now  Banca Intesa) introduced this service just days before Banca  Commerciale Italia, which promoted the service as Italy’s first  remote banking service in 1995.32  PC banking  Of the five countries, the UK pioneered PC banking in 1985.  The Netherlands followed one year later. Italy and France lagged  about ten years behind in introducing PC banking services. In  the UK, the Bank of Scotland introduced its ‘Home and Office  Banking Service’ (HOBS) in 1985,33 using a keyboard that was  plugged into the televsion and the telephone socket.34 The cus-  tomer could view his balance, scroll back through statements,  transfer money between accounts or pay bills directly, and the  system could also be operated by PC. The first bank that intro-  duced a system specifically designed for the PC was Lloyds TSB  in 1996.35 In 1986, the Postbank introduced ‘Girotel’ in the  Netherlands.36 In France, BNP introduced the PC banking service  ‘BNP Micro’ in 1994.37  The fact that France lags five years in telephone banking ser-  vices and nine years in PC banking services can be explained by  its national videotext system Télétel, popularly known as ‘minit-  el’, introduced in the mid-1980s by the French government  together with France Telecom.38 In 1983 there were 120,000 min-  itel terminals in use, growing to 17 million by 1999. This tele-  phone-based interactive system offers a wide array of services  including an electronic telephone directory and home shopping.  Services vary between banks, but almost every single bank started  its own Minitel-based remote banking system in the mid-1980s.  French banks had thus no urgent need to offer other forms of  remote banking.  Italy was the last country to offer PC banking, with Cariplo’s  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 189  Of the five countries,  the UK pioneered PC  banking in 1985  A branchless bank is  defined here as a  bank that only offers  remote banking  services  The Changing Landscape of Financial Services190  1997 launch of ‘QuiCariplo’, a product with both PC banking  and Internet banking options.32  Internet banking  The time lags in the diffusion pattern of Internet banking are  much shorter than for telephone and PC banking. Sweden first  introduced Internet services in 1995, followed one year later by  Italy. France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands made  Internet banking possible two years after Sweden’s introduction  of it.  The fact that Sweden leads in Internet banking can be  explained both by its sparse population—branches are often dis-  tant from consumers’ homes—and its PC penetration ratio,  which is the highest in Europe.39 The Swedish bank Trygg-  Banken (now SEB) was the first bank to launch Internet bank-  ing.40 In 1996, Italy’s Cassa Risparmio di Firenze followed,41  while the Nationwide Building Society launched the UK’s first  Internet banking service in 1997.14 The same year saw Rabobank  offer Internet banking in the Netherlands,42 and Banque Directe  (owned by BNP Paribas) in France.43  Branchless banks  Our fifth indicator is the establishment of the first branchless  bank (see Table 2). A branchless bank is defined here as a bank  that only offers remote banking services. Conventional banks also  offer remote banking services, but these are complementary to  their existing product line. A branchless bank is usually owned  by an existing bank, but managed as a separate business unit  under a different brand name.  As already mentioned, First Direct was the first to offer a com-  plete banking service in the UK via the telephone in 1989,29 and  it was also the first branchless bank in the five countries investi-  gated here. According to the Financial Times,30 Banque Directe  of France, founded in 1994, ‘is modelled unashamedly on First  Direct’. Sweden also introduced its first branchless bank, Sesam  (owned by S-E-Banken), in 1994.44 In Italy, the insurer Ras cre-  ated a separate business unit, called Rasbank, to offer telephone  banking services in 1995.45 We did not find a branchless bank  offering complete banking services in the Netherlands. A case of  a branchless bank is Egg, a stand-alone branchless bank set up  by Prudential, the UK insurance firm (see Exhibit 3).  Country-specific versus generic European  patterns of diffusion  What can we learn from the different patterns of diffusion in  regulatory changes and technological developments? Are they  country-specific or industry-generic? Does the pace of diffusion  increase across countries? Below we reflect on the patterns that  were described in the previous two sections. We first assess these  patterns by integrating Tables 1 and 2, resulting in an overview  Exhibit 3. Branchless banking in the UK: Prudential and  Egg  Prudential is a leading assurance company, specialising in  personal financial products, primarily pensions, fund management,  life assurance and other general insurance. Total net profit over  1999 accumulated to   870 million; total assets by the end of  1999 were   241.7 billion and its market capitalisation was   29.7  billion by April 8, 2000.  Prudential’s main products were likely to be under some  pressure in the new millennium. Life assurance is a product  whose historical UK growth resulted from a favourable tax  treatment—much of which is no longer available. Pensions and  fund management are both products whose volumes are likely to  grow, but margins are diminishing.  In this changing environment, it is not difficult to see that  banking, with its historically high profit margins, would be  attractive, particularly as Prudential was already a well-known  financial brand and there was the additional expectation of cross-  selling of Prudential’s own products. Hence, in 1996, Prudential  recruited Mike Harris, who had formerly been responsible for the  launch of First Direct, the largest UK telephone bank. Initially, his  objective was to fill out Prudential’s product range by adding  banking products—selling them under the Prudential name.  Customer research during 1997 showed that a major change was  taking place, with increasing customer expectations of ‘anywhere,  any time’ banking. Further research in new technologies showed  a major opportunity for new delivery channels. This was  presented to the Prudential Board in January 1998 and resulted in  the birth of Egg, launched in October 1998 as a division of  Prudential.  Initially, Egg was designed as a telephone-based bank, but as  technology progressed rapidly, the operation was soon switched  to be based on the Internet. The main Egg products are savings  accounts and credit cards, together with some personal loans and  mortgages. Since its launch, Egg has attracted one million  customers (2 per cent of the UK banking market), and has total  assets of £8.6 billion while cumulative losses have risen to £0.3  billion. As a result of floating Egg on the London Stock Exchange,  the Prudential share price increased substantially since the  Prudential shares were re-rated as ‘new economy’ shares.  Although the question remains as to whether it will produce  sustainable long-term profits, the evolution of Egg from Prudential  is a major directional change for a long-established UK assurance  company.  of early versus late movers, showing the time lags between the  first mover and the followers.  Figure 3 shows that the UK leads in diffusing regulatory  changes, closely followed by the Netherlands.

Early vs. late movers in the diffusion of technological and  regulatory changes. Source: Erasmus Strategic Renewal Centre  (derived from Tables 1 and 2)  tain has used deregulation to promote competition in its finan-  cial services industry. Sweden is early in diffusing technological  developments, followed again by the Netherlands and the UK.  France and Italy are last in diffusing both regulatory and techno-  logical changes. Sweden’s position in diffusing regulatory changes  can be explained by its late joining of the European Union. These  differences suggest country-specific patterns of diffusion. To  detect changes over time in the diffusion of regulatory and tech-  nological changes, we added up the time lags of the five countries  for each indicator.  Figure 4 shows the increasing speed of diffusion of the regulat-  ory indicators. Whereas the time lag regarding the deregulation  of interest rates and the liberalisation of capital flows mounted  up to eleven years for some countries at the beginning of the  1980s, the finalisation of the diffusion period of prudential regu-  lation was two years at the most in the middle of the 1990s. The  speed of diffusion has become about five times higher and more  similar across the countries investigated. Such a pattern, how-  Figure 4. Accumulated time lags per indicator of regulatory change. Source: Erasmus Strategic Renewal  Centre (derived from Table 1)  ever, is less clear for the speed of diffusion of the various techno-  logical developments (see Figure 5).  But once again the more recent the technology developments  are, such as Internet banking, the faster the speed of diffusion  in comparison to older technologies such as ATM networks. In  the beginning of the 1970s the average time lag between the first  mover and the followers regarding ATM networks was about  twelve years. In the midst of the 1990s, the average time lag with  respect to introducing Internet banking was about two years.  Based on the presented data, this suggests that the speed of dif-  fusion of technological developments increased about six times.  These preliminary results suggest a process of European conver-  gence in which regulatory and technological changes are dis-  persed faster and faster across EU-countries.  Regulatory and technological changes are not the only  enabling forces for strategic renewal. An important demand-side  driver is changing consumer preferences; it is crucial that new  technological opportunities are aligned to changing consumer  preferences. An earlier example of changing consumer prefer-  ences is the success of remote banking, which undermines the  importance of conventional bricks-and-mortar outlets. Another  example is the growing popularity of a whole new range of fin-  ancial products, including hybrid products, and the appreciation  of one-stop financial shopping enabled by the permission to  combine banking and insurance activities. Payment methods  have seen a gradual change from cheques and cash towards debit  and credit cards and, most recently, to electronic payment  devices.  The growing popularity of these amenities has affected the  density of banks’ branch networks. Table 3 indicates that the  number of branches per 1,000 inhabitants decreased in France,  the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden by between 6 per cent  (France) to 31 per cent (Sweden), although, because of the elim-  ination of legal restrictions, branch density in Italy almost  doubled in the period between 1985 and 1997. Interestingly,  these data support our previous findings of country-specific pat-  terns in earlier time periods and industry-generic patterns in later  Figure 5.

We now turn to the impact that these strategic renewal-  enabling forces have had on the privatisation of financial services  firms, which appears to be mainly a country-specific phenom-  enon.  Privatisation processes in late movers  The share of private versus public ownership in the banking sec-  tors of the five countries is presented in Table 4.46 In 1988, the  French and Italian banking sectors had a relatively high degree  of public ownership, which coincides with their late mover  behaviour in diffusing regulatory and technological changes. The  consequent privatisation of the banking sector in these countries  is a further illustration of convergent pressures in Europe’s fin-  ancial landscape, and we describe these processes below.  Privatisation in France  As a consequence of the French socialist government’s nationalis-  ation program, 90 per cent of French banks were state-owned in  the early 1980s,47 but by the mid-1980s the French government  no longer considered the strategic position of the financial sector  a sufficient reason to maintain a direct hold on the strategic and  operating management of the sector.47 An additional motive for  privatisation was to reduce the ever-burdensome public debt,47  Table 4.

Exhibit 4. Post-privatisation developments in France:  SocGen  Société Générale (or SocGen) is one of the oldest universal French  banks. It was set up in 1864 as a merchant bank and is evolving  towards being a universal bank. SocGen was nationalised in 1945  and privatised in 1987. Total net profit over 1999 accumulated  to   1.98 million; total assets by the end of 1999 were   406.5  billion and its market capitalisation was   25.5 billion by April 8,  2000.  Technological developments and deregulation prompted many  European financial services firms to exploit the opportunity to  expand abroad, resulting in an increasingly competitive pan-  European arena. As a result, the French financial services sector,  formerly characterised by an affable banking fraternity, entered a  consolidation battle. The competitive pressures forced French  banks to cut costs and bulk up by merging just like their  European rivals.  In order to reduce costs, SocGen decided to reorganise its  network by reducing the number of regional services and by  developing distance operations with its customers. The strategy of  SocGen focused on developing its position in traditional banking  in France with higher margins, and developing international  market activities. SocGen’s first acquisition in 1996 of Crédit du  Nord, another French retail bank with 1,300 agencies and 8,395  employees, can be considered its first major move to fortify its  position on the French market. SocGen also developed  internationally by setting up a new team in New York, whose  objective was to develop into an international investment bank.  In 1999, SocGen planned to merge with Paribas, the country’s  biggest player. BNP atempted to break up that deal by trying to  buy both banks, but ultimately was forced to make the best of a  marriage to Paribas. BNP obtained only 31.7 per cent of SocGen,  placing the outcome in the hands of French regulators who  ordered the return of all tendered shares to their original holders.  BNP however obtained 65.1 per cent of Paribas, which in 1999  resulted in a merger.  Internationally, SocGen benefited from its presence in  international banking and capital markets. For instance, it has a  large stronghold in Germany and Austria through its Sogenal  subsidiary, and in 1998 a new division was set up to focus on  retail banking outside France. After the battle, SocGen  strengthened cooperation with British insurer CGU, which doubled  its stake in SocGen to 6.9 per cent. However, SocGen still lacks a  consistent international strategy. Only 17 per cent of its  employees are in foreign countries, and its international  development seems to be constricted by France’s  underdeveloped shareholder value culture and its traditional two-  tier market structure (consisting of banks and credit cooperatives).

Continued.  The six-month takeover battle with BNP could be seen as a  victory for the 1986 banking reform. It is considered a huge step  forward for the restructuring of the French banking system and  the acknowledgement that shareholders should control it.

Privatisation of the French financial sector really took off in  1987 when Paribas, Société Générale and Crédit Commercial de  France were privatised. This first wave was followed by a second  in the mid-1990s. In 1993, Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP)  was privatised; in 1994, Union Des Assurances (UAP); in 1996,  Assurances Générales de France; and GAN in 1998. The most  recent privatisation is that of Crédit Lyonnais in 1999.  The government often called on privatised companies, includ-  ing banks, to act as ‘noyaux dur’ for other privatisation candi-  dates. By serving the role of strategic partner and holding ‘hard  core’ stakes, a ‘noyau dur’ can, for instance, support the board  in hostile takeover situations.48 The privatised Société Générale  was one of the first companies to declare its interest in acting as  a ‘noyau dur’,49 and more financial services firms followed. The  French banking reform had significant effects on its formerly  sedate financial industry. Some banks even attempted to lock  others in through cross-stake holdings (which we discuss in the  ‘Post-privatisation developments in France’ case in Exhibit 4  Privatisation in Italy  Italy’s privatisation efforts are considered to be one of the major  forces behind the tremendous change that has taken place in the  Italian economy during the 1990s. At the start of the 1990s, the  public sector in Italy controlled about 80 per cent of the banking  sector. Banks were protected from competition and could main-  tain high margins. State control over the Italian banks was  guaranteed, on the one hand by a state holding company (fully  owned by the Ministry of the Treasury) and, on the other, by  local governments through charitable foundations. The privatis-  ation process began with the transformation of the charitable  foundations into joint-stock companies. Later, the shares of the  companies were offered through stock exchanges or through  private placements.  The process started in December 1993 with the privatisation  of Credito Italiano, followed by the privatisation of Banca Com-  merciale Italiana in February of 1994. Both organisations were  commercial banks and were part of the state holding company  IRI (Instituto per la Recostruzion Industriale). In the early 1990s,  IRI-controlled companies employed 400,000 people. Gradually,  all the firms belonging to the holding company were privatised,  which resulted in the dismantling of IRI in the spring of 2000.  This section has suggested that the legacy of national owner-  ship structures50 has largely defined the scope and timing of pri-  vatisation programmes. In the Netherlands, the UK and Sweden,  the relatively low degree of public involvement in the banking  sector made privatisation waves in the late 1980s and 1990s  unnecessary. France and Italy, on the other hand, had a public  banking sector. These countries reduced their government stakes  to pay off public debts and to create a more efficient banking  sector. We now address consolidation patterns in the European  financial landscape aimed at increasing scale and scope.  Industry structure: consolidation patterns across  Europe  This section describes the impact of the two forces discussed  above on the changes in industry structure. We focus on merger  and acquisition activities in the banking sector of the five coun-  tries from 1991 to 1998 (see Figure 6).  Figure 6 shows the relatively high number of these trans-  actions, about 380, across the countries investigated during 1991  and 1992. This coincides with the liberalisation of the banking  regulations and the establishment of the single European market  in 1992, suggesting that banks chose to combine forces to cope  with these changes. During the years 1997–1998 this number  decreased to about 125 mergers and acquisitions. With a total  number of 375 and 290 transactions over the period 1991–1998,  the late movers Italy and France displayed significantly more  action than the other countries. Although the number of mergers  and acquisitions was relatively high in the beginning of the 1990s,  the value of these activities increases from the middle of that dec-  ade.  This second merger wave—started in the years 1995–1996 by  France, the Netherlands and the UK—really took off in 1997  Figure 6. Banking merger and acquisition activity in the five EU countries.

Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 197  Cross-border mergers  are still rare, and  there are still no pan-  European banks  which have more  than two home  markets  The Changing Landscape of Financial Services198  when the total value spent on mergers and acquisitions in these  five counties exceeded US$47 billion. Additional data shows that,  in the period from May 1997 to May 1998, the total value of  bank mergers in all European countries amounted to US$127  billion—a quadrupling compared to the year before.51 This wave  was followed by a period of mega-mergers in 1999 and 2000.  Examples are the US$12 billion merger of BNP and Paribas in  France in 1999, and the US$32 billion merger between RBS and  NatWest in the UK in 2000.  To describe the international dimension of these mergers and  acquisitions, the number of domestic versus cross-border acqui-  sitions in the European banking sector are presented in Table 5.  Most of the transactions during the 1990s were home country  mergers aimed at protecting the domestic market. Cross-border  acquisitions were still rare, despite the ongoing European inte-  gration process. Financial institutions in the UK, France and Ger-  many have been most active in international mergers and acqui-  sitions; financial players in the UK, France, Spain, Italy and  Belgium were targeted the most.52 The Benelux and especially  the Scandinavian countries have seen the most significant and  successful53 cross-border mergers. An example of a successful  cross-border merger is MeritaNordbanken. Exhibit 5 describes  the evolution of this bank which, saved from bankruptcy in 1992,  developed into a successful pan-Scandinavian financial insti-  tution. Merger and acquisition activities have had a major impact  on the structure of the financial industries of the five countries  investigated. We indicate their impact by providing changes in  the concentration ratio of the largest five firms in each country.  Table 6 shows that these ratios have changed over the period  1985–1997, but not in the same way for all countries. Sweden,  followed by the Netherlands, showed the highest concentration  ratio in 1997. The concentration ratio of the Italian financial  industry increased, but still has a long way to go compared to  the Netherlands and Sweden, and the UK market also remains  rather fragmented. France is an exception in that its concen-  tration ratio decreased, in spite of the restructuring of its finan-  cial services industry.  In conclusion we see increasing merger and acquisition activity  across Europe. Most of these are domestic. Cross-border mergers  are still rare, and there are still no pan-European banks which  have more than two home markets. The concentration ratios of  France, Italy and the UK indicate that there is sufficient room  for further consolidation in these countries.  Table 5.

Frontrunners in cross-border integration:  MeritaNordbanken  MeritaNordbanken was established in 1998 through the merger of  Finland’s dominant universal bank Merita with the major Swedish  retail operations of Nordbanken. MeritaNordbanken is one of the  leading Nordic bank groups, with a broad range of financial  products and services. Total net profits over 1999 accumulated  to   1.098 million and its total assets by the end of 1999 were    103.8 billion.  After the merger, its top management tried to establish a  completely new entity and immediately started a process of  integrating the two banks. CEO Hans Dalborg characterised the  merger in the bank’s 1998 Annual Report as: ‘A merger for growth  between equal and complementary companies in which specialist  expertise is exchanged and enriches work. It is not based solely  on the idea of eliminating work duplication.’ From the time Merita  and Nordbanken merged, the bank has been engaged in a series  of attempts to establish an integrated pan-Scandinavian banking  group.  On 6 May 2000, the bank announced the acquisition of  Unidanmark, Denmark’s second biggest bank. The bank further  made an agreed takeover bid for Christiania Bank, Norway’s  second largest bank. (Government approval for this acquisition  has still to be obtained.) With its aggressive pan-Scandinavian  strategy, MeritaNordbanken seems to have an early mover  advantage over its Scandinavian peers. The necessary cross-border  integration, however, also has its costs and associated risks.  Whether the merger and acquisition strategy of  MeritaNordbanken proves more successful then the organical  expansion strategy followed by competitor Handelsbanken  remains to be seen.  European financial services: 2000 and beyond  In this final section we will briefly discuss our findings, point  out several limitations, and suggest issues for future research. We  will conclude by indicating the future changes we expect in the  European financial services landscape.  Our findings reveal, on the one hand, country-specific patterns  in the diffusion of regulatory and technological changes, first  mover behaviour being displayed in both the United Kingdom  and the Netherlands. We have illustrated the catching-up of the  late movers, France and Italy, and indicated changes in their  national landscape by discussing their privatisation processes. On  the other hand, our findings indicate that the speed of diffusion  of the two forces has become more similar across the countries  investigated. This suggests industry-generic patterns and a grow-  ing convergence across the five countries, making the rather frag-  mented and stable European financial services landscape more  and more interdependent and dynamic. Furthermore, our find-  ings suggest a substantial increase in the speed of diffusion of  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 199  The Changing Landscape of Financial Services200  Table 6.

Limitations and future research  There are several limitations to our analysis of the changing land-  scape in the European financial services sector. Due to the fact  that our regulatory and technological indicators are related to  the banking industry, developments in, for example, the  insurance and securities sector were largely kept out of the analy-  sis. The ongoing revolution in these sectors, blurring the bound-  aries between the industries54 constituting the financial services  sector, on which we touched in the ING case (Exhibit 2), and  the invasion of new ‘click’ players in the online financial services  sector55 seem to take the developments in the financial services  sector to another level.  A second limitation is our focus on only two of the key forces  that enable strategic renewal. Other major influences, including  changing demographics and consumer preferences, and the  impact of disintermediation and corporate governance structures  (as pointed out by Canals and Porter,56 among others) were to  a large extent left out of our analysis. However, several of these  forces and aspects interact with our regulatory and technological  indicators and are as such touched upon indirectly. A third limi-  tation is our focus on only five EU countries and on European-  based financial services firms.  Since this article is a first attempt to assess changing competi-  tive landscapes in the European financial services sector, many  issues remain to be addressed in future research.57 One issue to  be addressed is the impact on the pace of strategic renewal of  incumbents operating in first mover countries like the Nether-  lands and the UK (see Volberda et al. for a first approach58). In  this connection, an interesting question is to what extent firms  in first mover countries have stronger managerial intentions  regarding strategic renewal compared to firms in late mover  countries. As suggested by Lewin and Volberda,59 the mutual  influence of both environmental selection forces and managerial  adaptations on strategic renewal journeys can be fruitfully ana-  lysed from a co-evolutionary perspective.  A second issue is the incorporation of more EU countries such  as Germany and Spain into the analysis. Germany is the home  country of one of Europe’s biggest banks (Deutsche Bank) while  Spain is interesting in terms of the pace of consolidation and  cross-border acquisitions, and the emergence of new banking  models.60  A third issue is the investigation of how changes at global level  impact the strategic renewal context of the European financial  services landscape. For example, how will the 1998 creation of  Citigroup, with the strategic intent of being ‘the global leader in  financial services’,61 influence the pace and nature of strategic  renewal in European incumbents? This issue raises important  questions such as who will be among the top ten truly global  financial services providers? Which of the European players will  be on that list, and which will become successful niche players?62  A fourth issue relates to differences in the speed of penetration  of new technologies across countries. This article has focused on  the introduction dates of regulations and new technologies in  each of the countries investigated, but we have not estimated the  speed of penetration within a country of, for instance, a new  technology like the e-purse, which might increase our under-  standing of the pace of diffusion patterns and how these are trig-  gered by changing consumer preferences across countries.  Another interesting issue for further investigation, therefore, is  the influence of changing consumer preferences on the context  for strategic renewal.  A final task for future research is to investigate the relation  between the profitability of incumbents, new entrants and the  speed of adoption of technological and regulatory developments.  For instance, the relatively high ROEs of UK banks in particular  have attracted new entrants with new approaches, probably  speeding up the diffusion of regulations and technologies in  the UK.63  Managerial challenges  In conclusion, based on our preceding analysis of the changing  European landscape, we would expect that the European finan-  cial services sector will be lifted to another level of turbulence  in the twenty-first century. We have observed that the speed of  diffusion across the five EU countries has become more similar  and pointed at converging patterns of consolidation. The privat-  isation of the French and Italian financial services sectors indi-  cates further convergence. However, it appears that the consoli-  dation process of the past decade was primarily domestically  oriented within the same industries, aimed at gaining economies  of scale and defending the home turf. Of the investigated coun-  tries, this process was most extreme in the Netherlands.  We expect that, after domestic markets have been consoli-  dated, a second wave of both cross-border and cross-sector con-  solidation will take place. The moves of Dutch and Swedish play-  ers, whose domestic markets are most consolidated, suggest  consolidation will first occur in nearby markets and sectors. We  predict that it will still take several years before financial services  Long Range Planning, vol 34 2001 201  the European  financial services  sector will be lifted to  another level of  turbulence in the  twenty-first century  The Changing Landscape of Financial Services202  companies with a real European look and feel about them will  emerge.64  Exhibit 6 illustrates the struggle of Storebrand, which has  attempted to cope with this changing landscape by cross-industry  and cross-border expansion. Cross-border and cross-industry  mergers and acquisitions might trigger different types of strategic  renewal journeys, as discerned by Volberda et al.60 We predict  that cross-border consolidations are likely to be driven by scale  and efficiency considerations and are, therefore, more closely  associated with emergent renewal journeys. Cross-industry merg-  ers and acquisitions, in particular between incumbent financial  services firms and incumbent firms from related industries like  telecommunications and retail, are likely to be driven by a stra-  Exhibit 6. Struggling for renewal: Storebrand  Storebrand AS is Norway’s largest insurance company offering a  full range of traditional insurance products in both life and  general insurance. It currently operates two banks serving  different market segments. Net income over 1999 reached  approximately   125 million and the firm’s total assets  accumulated to   18.6 billion by the end of 1999. On April 8,  2000, the company had a market capitalisation of   2.3 billion.  Today’s Storebrand is the product of approximately 70 mergers  and acquisitions. In the 1980s, Storebrand merged with Uni  Insurance to form Uni Storebrand, and this combination became  Norway’s largest insurance company. The next attempt to grow  was initiated by a charismatic CEO in 1990–91 when, in a hostile  takeover attempt, he tried to acquire the largest Swedish  insurance company, Skandia, to establish a pan-Scandinavian  insurance giant. The takeover attempt failed, however, leaving Uni  Storebrand with an extremely high and unmanageable debt load.  Because of Norway’s state intervention policy, the company went  into government receivership and managed to survive. The CEO  was forced to resign, and the government appointed an interim  chairman to take over operations.  Uni Storebrand spent the next few years consolidating and  restructuring in an attempt to regain its quality brand image and  financial strength. A new CEO, Aage Korsvold, took control of the  company in 1995 and started a new period of growth and  acquisitions. In 1998, Storebrand attempted a merger with  Norway’s second largest bank to form a national bank/assurance  combination. This growth strategy also failed, this time because of  the dissatisfaction of a major shareholder group.  The case of Storebrand clearly shows that, in a turbulent  environment, companies are not always successful and have to  be flexible in their strategy to keep up with the competition.  Moreover, it shows that national governments can play an  important role in shaping the financial services landscape. Success  for Storebrand, however, seems to lie in growth beyond its  national borders.  tegic intent to change the industry rules and are, therefore, more  closely associated with directed or transformational renewal jour-  neys.  The two forces of regulatory change and technological devel-  opment have not only greatly diminished spatial and cross-sector  impediments to offering financial services; according to the find-  ings of this article, a substantial increase in the speed of diffusion  of these forces has taken place as well. These developments  enable firms to offer combinations of all sorts of financial activi-  ties quickly in any EU member country. Novel technologies, new  business models and strategic alliances53 might partly replace  often difficult-to-manage mergers and acquisitions by making it  easier to offer financial services around the clock to customers  located anywhere. Information technology by itself, however, is  no panacea, merely enabling the required multi-channel bank-  ing strategy.65  These opportunities encourage non-financial players like GE  and Microsoft, telecommunications companies such as KPN and  Vodaphone and European retailers like Ahold, Sainsbury and  Tesco to enter the financial services sector. These firms are con-  fronted in their home industries with regulatory change and  technological developments as well, triggering the necessity for  their strategic renewal. The confrontation between non-financial  players like Microsoft and incumbents in the financial services  sector, each looking for strategic renewal options, will give rise  to an even more dynamic and interdependent financial services  landscape in which the boundaries will become less clear.  These recent developments are driving the European financial  services sector further into a state of hyper-competition. We now  begin to see the shape of an upcoming ‘rugged landscape’ that  may shake up the incumbent financial services players. The  future will confront these incumbent financial services firms with  the even more profound challenge of both competing and coop-  erating with new players, making strategic renewal journeys not  only a challenge, but also a necessity for survival.

In this article we will focus on the first two forces mentioned  in Taylor’s article. However, we consider privatisation not as  a separate force. Canals discussed the following four factors  having impact on the banking industry in industrialised  countries: deregulation, globalisation, disintermediation and  new competitors, and (information) technology.

Senior Team Attributes and Organizational  Ambidexterity: The Moderating Role of  Transformational Leadership  Justin J. P. Jansen, Gerard George,  Frans A. J. Van den Bosch and Henk W. Volberda  Erasmus University Rotterdam; Imperial College London; Erasmus University Rotterdam;  Erasmus University Rotterdam  abstract Organizations capable of pursuing exploration and exploitation simultaneously  have been suggested to obtain superior performance. Combining both types of activities and  achieving organizational ambidexterity, however, leads to the presence of multiple and  often conflicting goals, and poses considerable challenges to senior teams in ambidextrous  organizations. This study explores the role of senior team attributes and leadership behaviour  in reconciling conflicting interests among senior team members and achieving organizational  ambidexterity. Findings indicate that a senior team shared vision and contingency rewards  are associated with a firm’s ability to combine high levels of exploratory and exploitative  innovations. In addition, our study shows that an executive director’s transformational  leadership increases the effectiveness of senior team attributes in ambidextrous organizations  and moderates the effectiveness of senior team social integration and contingency rewards.  Hence, our study clarifies how senior executives reconcile conflicting demands and facilitate  the balancing of seemingly contradictory forces in ambidextrous organizations. Implications  for literatures on senior team attributes, transformational leadership and organizational  ambidexterity are discussed.  INTRODUCTION  Firms are constantly faced with the challenge of exploiting existing competencies and  exploring new ones (Vera and Crossan, 2004). As they seek to adapt to environmental  changes, firms explore new ideas or processes, and develop new products and services for  emerging markets. Simultaneously, they need stability to leverage current competences  and exploit existing products and services (Danneels, 2002). Hence, prior literatures have  increasingly argued that successful firms are ambidextrous – they generate competitive  advantages through revolutionary and evolutionary change (Tushman and O’Reilly,  Address for reprints: Justin J.

Journal of Management Studies 45:5 July 2008  0022-2380  1996), adaptability and alignment (Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004), or simultaneously  pursuing exploratory and exploitative innovation (Benner and Tushman, 2003).  Although studies have highlighted the benefits of balancing high levels of exploratory  and exploitative innovation (Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004; He and Wong, 2004), few  have examined the drivers of ambidexterity. The lack of research regarding this link is  surprising, especially since simultaneously pursuing both activities appears to be complex  and difficult to achieve (Benner and Tushman, 2003; Sheremata, 2000). Exploration and  exploitation may require fundamentally different and inconsistent architectures and  competencies that can create paradoxical challenges. Exploration refers to search, varia-  tion, and experimentation that result from decentralization, loose cultures, and less  formalized processes. Exploitation, on the contrary, captures refinement, efficiency, and  improvement that succeed by reducing variance and increasing control and formaliza-  tion (Benner and Tushman, 2003; March, 1991). Although studies are beginning to  address some factors that enable ambidexterity such as the appropriate structure  (Gilbert, 2005; Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996) and context (Gibson and Birkinshaw,  2004), there is little empirical evidence about the role of senior executives in ambidex-  trous organizations. Yet scholars have emphasized that senior executives are crucial to  firm outcomes (Hambrick and Mason, 1984) and play a decisive role in establishing a  supportive context and reconciling the implicit tension (Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004;  Smith and Tushman, 2005). Beyond a conceptual framework (Smith and Tushman,  2005), however, there have been few attempts to examine how senior executives con-  tribute to achieving ambidexterity.  This study adds to the emergent dialogue on ambidexterity in two important ways.  First, this study provides insight into the relationship between senior team attributes and  organizational ambidexterity. Combining exploration and exploitation within an orga-  nization poses considerable challenges to senior teams (Denison et al., 1995). Although  structural differentiation can help overcome resource and routine rigidity (Gilbert, 2005),  senior teams face tradeoffs in their decision-making. For instance, senior teams need to  allow for variety and local adaptation, yet facilitate collective action and strategic coher-  ence (O’Reilly and Tushman, 2004). In this sense, they face considerable role conflicts  and role ambiguities as senior teams in ambidextrous organizations are expected to  resolve contradictions through joint information processing and tight integration (Floyd  and Lane, 2000; Michel and Hambrick, 1992). We systematically examine three  attributes of senior teams that might help achieve organizational ambidexterity. In so  doing, this study deepens our understanding of how senior teams combine contradictory  strategic agendas and overcome paradoxes in decision-making associated with simulta-  neously pursuing exploratory and exploitative innovation.  Second, we explore the moderating role of leadership behaviour in senior team  dynamics and achieving organizational ambidexterity. Encouraging senior executives  to work as a team has been suggested as an important mechanism by which strategic  leadership can enhance senior team effectiveness in ambidextrous organizations. Studies  have argued that the executive director, as senior team leader, might participate in team  processes and thereby influence team dynamics and organizational outcomes (Finkel-  stein, 1992; Haleblian and Finkelstein, 1993; Hambrick, 1994; Peterson et al., 2003). For  instance, executive directors may improve team effectiveness through appropriate coach-  Transformational Leadership 983  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008  ing or process choices (Edmondson et al., 2003; Peterson et al., 2003; Wageman, 2001).  There is little empirical evidence on this contingency perspective, however, and scholars  have called for more research in this area (Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004; Smith and  Tushman, 2005). Our study addresses how executive directors may contribute to the  effectiveness of senior teams in ambidextrous organizations and considers how their  transformational leadership behaviour (Bass, 1985) strengthens the impact of senior team  attributes on achieving organizational ambidexterity.  In the next section, we present the theoretical review and hypotheses. Then, we  present the empirical findings using data from 305 senior team members and 89 execu-  tive directors at Dutch autonomous branches of a large European financial services firm.  These branches were chosen because of – although part of the financial services firm –  their autonomy with respect to the types of products and services offered under increas-  ingly dynamic and competitive environmental conditions. We conclude with a discussion  of the implications, limitations and issues for future research.  LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESES  Organizational Ambidexterity  Many studies have emphasized the need for organizations to combine exploration and  exploitation (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Kang and Snell, 2008; Levinthal and March,  1993), whereas others have associated exploration and exploitation with different types  of learning and innovation (Benner and Tushman, 2003; He and Wong, 2004; Jansen  et al., 2006; Smith and Tushman, 2005). Exploratory innovations are radical and  designed to meet the needs of emerging customers or markets (Abernathy and Clark,  1985; Benner and Tushman, 2003). They require new knowledge or departure from  existing knowledge and often are associated with experimentation, flexibility, and diver-  gent thinking ( Jansen et al., 2006). Conversely, exploitative innovations are incremental  and meet the needs of existing customers or markets (Abernathy and Clark, 1985;  Benner and Tushman, 2003). They broaden existing knowledge and skills and often are  associated with efficiency, refinement, and focus (Zahra and George, 2002).  Based on case study research, Tushman and O’Reilly (1996) proposed that ambidex-  trous organizations possess the ability to combine exploratory and exploitative innova-  tion. Hence, prior literatures have defined organizational ambidexterity as the ability of  firms to pursue and synchronize exploratory and exploitative innovation simultaneously  (Benner and Tushman, 2003; He and Wong, 2004). Organizational ambidexterity not  only helps firms overcome structural inertia that results from a focus on exploitation, but  also refrain firms from accelerating exploration without deriving benefits from these  activities (Levinthal and March, 1993).  Senior Executives, Reconciling Conflicts, and Achieving Organizational  Ambidexterity  O’Reilly and Tushman (2004) found that ambidextrous organizations host exploratory  and exploitative innovation in structurally independent organizational units that  J. J. P. Jansen et al.984  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008  remained strategically integrated into the senior management hierarchy. In this sense,  senior management allows departure from existing knowledge within exploratory units  (Gilbert, 2005; Hill and Rothaermel, 2003), yet establishes cross-fertilization and syner-  gies with ongoing businesses in exploitative units (Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996). In  addition, they need to allocate scarce resources to both types of units: allowing experi-  mentation and the generation of exploratory efforts by avoiding resource constraints  when exploratory activities become overwhelmed by mature businesses. Achieving ambi-  dexterity may create conflicts among senior team members as the short-term, efficiency  and control focus of exploitative units is at odds with the long-term, experimental focus  and decentralized architectures at exploratory units.  Because of these paradoxical ambidextrous designs, senior teams typically face role  conflicts that may diminish acceptance of decisions (O’Reilly and Tushman, 2004). The  likelihood of conflict is further exacerbated by the fact that senior team members are  responsible for differentiated exploratory or exploitative organizational units (Eisenhardt  et al., 1997; Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996). Achieving ambidexterity may enhance  self-interested behaviour in which senior team members perceive direct competition  regarding the allocation of scarce resources (Bower, 1970). Senior teams in ambidextrous  organizations are therefore expected to recognize and translate different, ambiguous,  and conflicting expectations into workable strategies. How these conflicting tensions are  resolved within senior teams is a crucial element in the ability of firms to create integra-  tive and synergetic value among exploratory and exploitative activities and to achieve  organizational ambidexterity. To uncover how senior teams are able to reconcile con-  flicting interests and overcome barriers associated with combining exploratory and  exploitative innovation, we consider how senior team attributes and leadership affect the  achievement of ambidexterity as depicted in Figure 1.

Conceptual model  Transformational Leadership 985  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008  Scholars have argued that an overarching set of values, team integration processes,  and common fate incentive systems enable senior teams to manage inconsistent align-  ments (Siegel and Hambrick, 2005; Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996). Together, these  studies suggest that the effectiveness of senior teams in ambidextrous organizations is  associated with a set of senior team attributes: (1) shared vision, (2) social integration, and  (3) group contingency rewards (Hambrick, 1994; O’Reilly and Tushman, 2004; Siegel  and Hambrick, 2005; Smith and Tushman, 2005). In addition, prior studies have been  focusing on the role of leadership in realizing the effectiveness of senior teams under  ambiguous and uncertain conditions (Edmondson et al., 2003; Eisenhardt et al., 1997).  Strategic leaders may be more or less directive in resolving conflicts and reconciling the  paradox of combining exploratory and exploitative innovation. For instance, executive  directors may assign different senior team members to exploratory and exploitative  activities, recognize conflicts between agendas, and facilitate discussion and debate about  possible synergies (Smith and Tushman, 2005). Hence, we propose that leadership  behaviour influences the effectiveness of senior teams in ambidextrous organizations. To  better understand how senior executives affect organizational ambidexterity, we explore  how senior team attributes (i.e. shared vision, social integration, and team contingency  rewards) and leader behaviour (i.e. transformational leadership) enable organizations to  reconcile conflicting demands and combine exploratory and exploitative innovation.  Senior Team Attributes and Organizational Ambidexterity  Senior team shared vision. A senior team shared vision embodies the collective goals and  aspirations of senior team members that express the developmental path for an organi-  zation’s future (Larwood et al., 1995; Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998). A shared set of goals and  values provides a common strategic direction that ameliorates conflicting interests and  disagreement. It can override the adverse effects of divergent goals and conflicting  perspectives among senior team members responsible for exploratory and exploitative  units (Brewer and Miller, 1984; Mackie and Goethals, 1987), and prevent senior teams  from devolving into fragmented structures. By contrast, a lack of such shared values can  lead to distrust and suspicion within senior teams and throughout the organization,  making it hard to draw common characteristics and to identify, extract and combine  diverse skills, abilities, and perspectives within exploratory and exploitative units. Hence,  common goals and shared values in ambidextrous organizations motivate senior team  members to generate opportunities for resource exchange and combination across  exploratory and exploitative units (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995; Tsai and Ghoshal,  1998; Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996). They contribute to a collective understanding of  how senior team members might resolve contradictory agendas and engage in produc-  tive behaviours towards overarching goals (Orton and Weick, 1990; O’Reilly and  Tushman, 2004; Sinkula et al., 1997).  In other words, when a shared vision is acknowledged throughout senior teams,  members are willing to consider and incorporate opposing views about tactical issues  (Simons et al., 1999). To illustrate, consider the description of O’Reilly and Tushman  (2004) of Ciba Vision, a producer of contact lenses, which decided to combine explor-  atory and exploitative innovation by competing in the mature business of conventional  J. J. P. Jansen et al.986  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008  contact lenses and to explore new technologies and markets for extended wear and  fashion lenses. These latter exploratory activities required new technology and manu-  facturing competences and took place in physically separated organizational units. Yet  they required collaboration and coordination with existing organizational units. As the  emerging technologies might threaten the future of existing organizational units and  create potential conflicts in senior teams, Ciba Vision developed common goals and  values by propounding a shared vision, ‘healthy eyes for life’, that justified the coexist-  ence of the old and emerging businesses. In this sense, a senior team shared vision  contributes to resolving conflicts regarding resource exchange and combination, and to  achieving organizational ambidexterity.  Hypothesis 1: Senior team shared vision increases the achievement of organizational  ambidexterity.  Senior team social integration. Social integration is a multifaceted phenomenon that reflects  the ‘attraction to the group, satisfaction with other members of the group, and social  interaction among the group members’ (O’Reilly et al., 1989, p. 22). Social integration  differs from shared vision, which refers to shared values and common understanding of  collective goals, in that social integration is directly related to affective factors or social  forces among senior team members (Smith et al., 1994). Previous studies, therefore, have  distinguished between both types of senior team attributes in examining team effective-  ness and performance (i.e. Ensley and Pearson, 2005; Klein and Mulvey, 1995).  Members of socially integrated teams exhibit greater efficiency in task coordination and  aspire for team success (O’Reilly et al., 1989; Smith et al., 1994). Socially integrated senior  teams are related to increased negotiation, compromise, and collaboration across orga-  nizational units (Michel andHambrick, 1992). In this way, members of socially integrated  senior teams are expected to work harder to recognize opportunities and synergies for  combining exploratory and exploitative activities (Smith et al., 1994). Social integration  increases collaborative problem solving that is based on social interaction and trust among  senior team members (Dailey, 1978). Such interaction and trust enable senior executives  to articulate and develop arguments more effectively and to build realistic understandings  of key preferences and conflicting roles in senior teams (Eisenhardt et al., 1997). Social  integration stimulates critical debate as senior team members are more likely to evaluate  alternative ways to reconcile conflicting goals associated with exploratory and exploitative  activities. It provides comfortable and familiar platforms that routinize thorough consid-  eration of conflicting strategic agendas and increases the confidence of senior executives to  engage in dissenting viewpoints ( Jehn et al., 1997). Hence, we propose that senior team  social integration contributes to achieving organizational ambidexterity.  Hypothesis 2: Senior team social integration increases the achievement of organiza-  tional ambidexterity.  Senior team contingency rewards. Previous research has suggested that pay patterns among  executives influence interactions and outcomes of senior teams (Baron and Pfeffer, 1994;  Gomez-Mejia et al., 1987; Siegel andHambrick, 2005). For instance, studies have argued  Transformational Leadership 987  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008  that contingency rewards, which reflect the degree to which benefits for individual team  members depend on their team’s outcome, are beneficial to senior teams confronted with  pressures for mutual adjustment (Harrison et al., 2002; Shaw et al., 2002; Wageman and  Baker, 1997). Team contingency rewards foster collaboration and create commitment to  organizational goals (Bloom, 1999). They cause senior team members to direct attention  and corresponding behaviour to interdependent rather than individual activities (Siegel  and Hambrick, 2005). Team contingency rewards create an outcome interdependency  among senior team members (Slavin, 1996; Wageman, 1995) and encourage them to  achieve integrative value through identifying ways to use shared resources across explora-  tory and exploitative units (Smith and Tushman, 2005). In this sense, team contingency  rewards motivate senior team members to transcend their unit’s direct interests and to  establish ways to allocate resources to both exploratory and exploitative innovation.  Moreover, they establish norms that motivate senior team members to advance thinking  and participate in clarifying problems and proposing solutions to complex issues  (Wageman, 1995). Team contingency rewards reduce interpersonal competition and  facilitate negotiation and mutual adjustment (Pfeffer, 1995) necessary for exploratory and  exploitative units to coexist. Govindarajan and Trimble (2005) described how Analog  Devices, a semiconductor company, avoided strong incentives tied to mature businesses’  performance and started to evaluate and reward senior managers based on overarching  achievements. In this sense, AnalogDeviceswas able to promote and leverage assets across  differentiated exploratory and exploitative units. In ambidextrous organizations, senior  team contingency rewards are likely to urge executives to transcend their unit’s direct  interests and allocate resources to and achieve integrative value across exploratory and  exploitative units (e.g. Smith and Tushman, 2005).  Hypothesis 3: Senior team contingency rewards increase the achievement of organiza-  tional ambidexterity.  Transformational Leadership, Senior Team Attributes and Organizational  Ambidexterity  Organizational literature has identified the importance of leader behaviour and in  particular, transformational leadership, to team and organizational outcomes (Bass,  1985; Lowe et al., 1996). Transformational leaders exhibit idealized influence, arouse  inspirational motivation, provide intellectual stimulation, and treat followers with indi-  vidualized consideration (Avolio et al., 1999). Idealized influence represents the degree to  which leaders are admired, respected, and trusted. This dimension includes charismatic  behaviour that causes followers to identify with the leader. Inspirational motivation is  defined as the degree to which leaders articulate an appealing vision and behave in ways  that motivate those around them by providing meaning and challenge to their followers’  work. Intellectual stimulation is defined as the degree to which leaders stimulate their  followers’ effort to be innovative and creative by questioning assumptions, reframing  problems, and approaching old situations in new ways. Individualized consideration  captures the degree to which leaders pay attention to each individual’s need for achieve-  ment and growth by acting as a coach or mentor (Bass et al., 2003).  J. J. P. Jansen et al.988  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008  Transformational leaders may affect senior team effectiveness by participating in and  facilitating senior teams to resolve conflicts and contradictory demands. Leaders exert  their influence by broadening and elevating team members’ goals and providing them  with confidence in performing beyond expectations (Dvir et al., 2002). Accordingly,  leaders in ambidextrous organizations may be more or less directive in affecting senior  team dynamics and influence the way how senior teams reach closure on a decision,  direct team discussion and structure debate (Edmondson et al., 2003). Intervention of  transformational leaders has appeared to be particularly relevant to senior teams with  goals and perspective asymmetries across senior team members (Stasser, 1999). By  translating shared goals and collective values in desired behaviour, for instance, trans-  formational leaders enhance the effectiveness of a senior team’s shared vision to reconcile  conflicting agendas and to implement synergies across exploratory and exploitative units.  Consistently, we argue that transformational leadership increases the effectiveness of  senior team attributes in achieving ambidexterity.  First, through inspirational motivation, transformational leaders display personal com-  mitment to shared goals and values, and emphasize the ideological importance of a senior  team’s shared vision (Shamir et al., 1998; Waldman et al., 2006). The idealized influence  of transformational leaders bolsters a sense of belongingness and inspires senior team  members to commit to the overarching goals and values across exploratory and exploita-  tive organizational units. To this end, transformational leaders facilitate the implementa-  tion of a shared senior team vision by translating shared goals and collective values in  desired behaviour and increasing the likelihood that a shared senior team vision is  implicated in actual collaborative action (Gardner and Avolio, 1998; Shamir et al., 1998).  Through individualized consideration, leaders can also enhance the effectiveness of a  shared senior team vision by providing ideological explanations that link exploratory and  exploitative efforts of individual senior team members to the achievement of shared goals  and values. In this sense, they motivate senior team members to get more involved in  searching integrative and synergetic value across exploratory and exploitative units and  realize the achievement of shared goals. Hence, by encouraging collaborative action and  creating affective response to overcoming conflicting agendas, transformational leader-  ship increases the impact of a shared senior team vision on achieving ambidexterity.  Second, transformational leadership also moderates the effectiveness of senior team  social integration in ambidextrous organizations. Transformational leaders use inspira-  tional motivation to emphasize harmonious relationships and encourage shared learning  experiences across senior team members with possible conflicting interests (Chen et al.,  1998; Vera and Crossan, 2004). For example, Waldman and Yammarino (1999) indi-  cated how Mary Kay Ash, former CEO of Mary Kay Cosmetics, offered women a career  as beauty consultants and articulated a compelling vision that stressed the coming  together as cohesive teams to accomplish organizational objectives. Through such intel-  lectual stimulation, transformational leaders induce senior team members to openly  discuss conflicting interests. In so doing, they encourage asymmetric information sharing  that enhances the quality of decision-making in socially integrated senior teams  (Edmondson et al., 2003). Moreover, past research has argued that idealized influence of  transformational leaders facilitates senior team behaviours to cascade to lower hierar-  chical levels (Avolio and Bass, 1995; Waldman and Yammarino, 1999). Based on role  Transformational Leadership 989  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008  modelling of transformational leaders, synergetic and integrative efforts of socially inte-  grated senior teams permeate across hierarchical levels. Such efforts inspire organiza-  tional members at lower echelons to demonstrate preferred behaviour and search for  synergetic possibilities across exploratory and exploitative units to achieve organizational  ambidexterity.  Third, although contingency rewards have typically been related to transactional  leadership, recent studies have shown that contingent rewards are associated with  transformational leadership behaviours as well (Bycio et al., 1995; Wofford et al.,  1998). Transformational leaders are believed to carefully manage performance-based  incentives by recognizing and rewarding effective performance based on values for  fairness and trust rather than on exchange agreements (Goodwin et al., 2001). Trans-  formational leaders motivate senior team members to think and act in terms of col-  lective interests (Bass, 1985) rather than in direct interests of their exploratory and  exploitative units. The idealized influence of transformational leaders involves the  display and attribution of role modelling for senior team members that promote the  transcendence of ordinary preoccupations and self-interests of senior team members  (Bass and Riggio, 2006). Moreover, through inspirational motivation, transformational  leaders articulate complex paradoxical challenges into attainable goals and rewards. As  Smith and Tushman (2005, p. 527) explained, such leadership behaviour signals con-  fidence in the ability of senior teams in ambidextrous organizations to reconcile con-  flicting situations and helps reduce threat and fear among senior team members. By  doing so, transformational leaders use individual consideration and intellectual stimu-  lation to express high confidence in the senior team’s ability to meet complex expec-  tations, and to increase the team’s efficacy that collective aspirations and rewards will  be achieved (Bono and Judge, 2003; Shamir et al., 1993). Individualized consideration  by transformational leaders may also decrease the probability of senior team members  to engage in social loafing, in which senior team members realize that they might ‘hide  in the team’ while still reaping the benefits of contingency rewards (Høigaard et al.,  2006). In this way, transformational leaders mitigate the potential negative effect of  social loafing resulting from establishing contingency rewards. Hence, transformational  leadership facilitates the acceptance and commitment to senior team contingency  rewards in ambidextrous organizations.  Overall, we predict that the effectiveness of the three senior team attributes in ambi-  dextrous organizations will be most pronounced when occurring in concert with a  transformational leadership behaviour of the executive director.  Hypothesis 4: Transformational leadership positively moderates the impact of (a) senior  team shared vision, (b) senior team social integration, and (c) senior team contingency  rewards on organizational ambidexterity.  METHODS  Setting and Data Collection  The empirical research was conducted at Dutch branches of a large European  financial services firm with a broad range of financial service providers in various  J. J. P. Jansen et al.990  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008  countries. The firm has more than $350 billion in assets and ranks among the top 30  on the Fortune Global 500 in terms of total revenue in the banking industry. We chose  the branches because they are geographically distinct, autonomous decision entities  with their own board of directors. They have autonomy with respect to types of prod-  ucts and services offered and markets within which to provide these products and  services. Each branch has its own senior management team with budget responsibil-  ities regarding several aspects of their operations such as pursuing exploratory and  exploitative innovation. Branches provide a wide range of products and services  that cover asset management, mortgages, loans and savings, insurance, leasing, equity  participation, corporate banking, and investment banking. Moreover, they operate in  markets with varying levels of environmental dynamism and competitiveness –  a condition required to observe branches pursuing different innovations (Han et al.,  1998).  To deal with potential problems associated with single-informant bias and common  method bias, we separated the measurement of the independent and dependent vari-  ables and collected data through multiple respondents. The first ‘executive director’  survey was designed for the executive director and a second senior team member of  each branch and included items on a branch’s exploratory and exploitative innovation.  The second ‘senior team’ survey was designed for remaining senior team members in  each branch and included items on senior team shared vision, senior team social inte-  gration, senior team contingency rewards, and the executive director’s transforma-  tional leadership style. We developed survey packages, each containing copies of the  executive director questionnaire and copies of questionnaires for senior team members  and administered them to 211 branches in the Netherlands. To ensure confidentiality,  we agreed not to reveal the names of the respondents and asked to return the ques-  tionnaire directly to us.  We received a total of 89 questionnaires from executive-directors, corresponding  to a 42 per cent response rate. From these 89 branches, we received 305 ‘senior  team’ questionnaires (34 per cent response rate). The number of senior team  members who responded ranged from 2 to 8 with a mean of 3.43 members per  branch. The executive directors had an average company tenure of 8.10 years  (s.d. = 7.26). The average company tenure of the senior team members was 5.88  years (s.d. = 5.61). The mean size of the branches was 128.74 (s.d. = 68.29) full-time  employees. To test for non-response bias, we examined differences between respon-  dents and non-respondents for our final sample. T-tests showed no significant differ-  ences based on a branch’s number of full-time employees, total assets, and prior  performance. We also compared early and late respondents (before and after 6 weeks)  in terms of control and model variables. These comparisons did not reveal any sig-  nificant differences (p < 0.05), indicating that non-response bias was not a problem in  this study.  Measurement and Validation of Constructs  This study used existing multi-item scales that were verified through various analyses  (items of constructs are provided in the appendix).  Transformational Leadership 991  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008  Organizational ambidexterity. Following prior studies, we consider exploratory and exploit-  ative innovation as orthogonal (Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004; He and Wong, 2004)  and used a two-step approach to develop a measure for organizational ambidexterity.  First, branch executive-directors provided information concerning their branch’s level  of exploratory and exploitative innovation. The measure for exploratory innovation was  adapted from Jansen et al. (2006). The six-item scale for exploratory innovation  (a = 0.91) captured the extent to which branches depart from existing knowledge and  pursue radical innovations for emerging customers or markets. In the context of financial  services, exploratory innovation has been associated with developing fundamentally new  loan structures and contingent contracts (Uzzi and Lancaster, 2003). A six-item scale  (a = 0.88) measured firm-level exploitative innovation ( Jansen et al., 2006) and captured the  extent to which branches build upon existing knowledge and pursue incremental inno-  vations that meet the needs of existing customers (Abernathy and Clark, 1985; Benner  and Tushman, 2003; Smith and Tushman, 2005). Prior research on financial services has  related exploitative innovation to aggressive lending, shopping the market and increasing  efficiency (Uzzi and Lancaster, 2003). To provide evidence of convergent and discrimi-  nant validity for branch-level exploratory and exploitative innovation, we performed  exploratory factor analysis. The analysis clearly replicated the intended two-factor struc-  ture with each item loading clearly on their intended factor (all factor loadings were  above 0.74 with cross-loadings below 0.25) and all factors having eigenvalues greater  than one. Second, to develop a measure for a branch’s level of organizational ambidex-  terity, we followed previous research and computed the multiplicative interaction  between exploratory and exploitative innovation. The computation of the multiplicative  interaction reflects arguments that both types of activities are orthogonal (cf. Gibson and  Birkinshaw, 2004; Gupta et al., 2006).  In addition, to examine reliability issues associated with the executive-director data, we  collected responses from a second senior teammember in each responding branch.Of the  89 branches that participated,we received 40 responses from second senior teammembers  located in branches that were comparable in size, age, and prior performance to our full  sample. We calculated an inter-rater agreement score (rwg) between the scores of the  executive director and the second senior team member for exploratory innovation and  exploitative innovation ( James et al., 1993). Themedian [average] inter-rater agreements  were 0.82 [0.80] and 0.89 [0.88] for both constructs, suggesting adequate agreement.  Senior team attributes and transformational leadership. The data for senior team attributes and  transformational leadership were collected through multiple senior team members per  branch. The measure for senior team shared vision (a = 0.84) was adapted from Sinkula et al.  (1997) and refers to the extent to which senior teams have collective goals and shared  aspirations. Senior team social integration (a = 0.77) was measured by seven items adapted  from Smith et al. (1994). The items reflected the attraction to the senior team, satisfaction  with other senior team members, and the social interaction among team members  (O’Reilly et al., 1989). Senior team contingency rewards (a = 0.73) refers to the extent to which  senior team incentives, such as bonuses and profit sharing, were tied to overall firm  performance. We adapted a four-item measure for senior team contingency rewards  from Collins and Clark (2003). Transformational leadership was assessed by senior team  J. J. P. Jansen et al.992  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008  members’ response to items of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ-5X;  Bass and Avolio, 1995). Each senior team member rated the items on transformational  leadership for his or her executive director on a five-point scale, with 1 = ‘strongly  disagree’ and 5 = ‘strongly agree’. The four dimensions of transformational leadership  consist of four items for intellectual stimulation, inspirational motivation, individualized  consideration, and eight items for idealized influence. Because the dimensions are highly  correlated (average r = 0.78) and past research showed that the dimensions of transfor-  mational leadership failed to exhibit discriminant validity in predicting outcomes, we  averaged the items to create a single index for transformational leadership (a = 0.96).  Similar to previous studies (Bono and Judge, 2003; Jung et al., 2003), we conducted  subsequent analyses using the composite index.  To empirically justify using data from the ‘senior team’ survey that assesses senior team  attributes and transformational leadership, we conducted various analyses to demonstrate  convergence and discriminant validity, within-team agreement and between-team dif-  ferences for senior team shared vision, social integration, contingency rewards, and  transformational leadership. First, convergent and discriminant validity of senior team  characteristics and transformational leadership were established through exploratory and  confirmatory factor analysis. Exploratory factor analysis clearly replicated the four-factor  model and did not reveal any evidence of a single underlying construct. Next, we used  confirmatory factor analysis on all items pertaining to senior team characteristics and  transformational leadership (with the four facet scores used as manifest indicators of the  latent transformational leadership factor) which yielded a model that fitted the data  adequately (c2(164) = 468.87, c2/df = 2.86, CFI = 0.931, NFI = 0.900, SRMR = 0.056).  Item loadings were as proposed and significant (p < 0.001), providing evidence for  convergent and discriminant validity. Second, we calculated an inter-rater agreement  score (rwg) for each variable ( James et al., 1993). Median [average] inter-rater agreement  was 0.81 [0.78] for senior team shared vision, 0.77 [0.78] for senior team social integra-  tion, 0.92 [0.91] for senior team contingency rewards, and 0.83 [0.81] for transforma-  tional leadership, which were well above the cut-off value of 0.70. Third, intra-class  correlations were generated using one-way analysis of variance. An indication of conver-  gence within firms is an ICC(1) value greater than zero with a corresponding ANOVA  F-statistic that is statistically significant (Kenny and La Voie, 1985). The ICC(1) values for  the particular variables ranged between 0.26 and 0.39 with significant F-statistics, indi-  cating that the means for the ratings for each variable accurately represent team scores.  Hence, results indicate that our measures represent concepts that are theoretically and  empirically distinguishable, and are not characterized by common method variance.  Control variables. We controlled for possible alternative explanations by including relevant  control variables. As larger branches may have more resources and yet lack the flexibility  to pursue exploratory and exploitative activities simultaneously (Ahuja and Lampert,  2001), we included the natural logarithm of the number of full-time employees within  branches to account for branch size. Senior team size could affect the heterogeneity of  senior teams, and accordingly, impact the achievement of ambidexterity. Following  previous studies, we measured senior team size through the number of senior executives  who are responsible for strategy formulation and implementation (e.g. Siegel and Ham-  Transformational Leadership 993  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008  brick, 2005). Previous research has suggested that gender may influence the extent  to which executive directors are recognized and accepted as legitimate leaders (Eagly  and Carli, 2003). Female leaders have been suggested to encounter obstacles when inter-  vening in senior team dynamics and affecting the effectiveness of senior teams in achiev-  ing organizational ambidexterity. Hence, we included a dummy variable CEO gender  (male = 1 and female = 0) to control for such possible confounding effects. An executive  director’s tenure was also included, because previous research has suggested that the  tenure of an executive director may be related to senior team effectiveness and organi-  zational outcomes (Haleblian and Finkelstein, 1993; Wu et al., 2005). Environmental  aspects, such as dynamism can trigger branches to develop new products and services.  Hence, we included a five-item scale (a = 0.91) adapted from Jansen et al. (2006) that  captures environmental dynamism.  ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  Table I presents descriptive statistics and correlations for study variables. Table II pre-  sents the regression results for organizational ambidexterity. Prior to the creation of the  interaction terms in model 3, we mean centred the independent variables (Aiken and  West, 1991). We also calculated variance inflation factors (VIF) to assess multicollinear-  ity. The maximum VIF within the models was 1.96, which is well below the rule-of-  thumb cut-off of 10 (Neter et al., 1990). The baseline model 1 contains the moderator  and control variables. Model 2 introduces effects of senior team attributes and model 3  examines the potential moderating effects of transformational leadership. We discuss the  results of the final model, i.e. model 3 in Table II.  The proposed positive effect of senior team shared vision on organizational ambidex-  terity (Hypothesis 1) was supported (b = 3.78, p < 0.01). The coefficient for senior team  social integration was not significantly related to organizational ambidexterity. Accord-  ingly, Hypothesis 2, which posited that social integration would contribute to overcoming  strategic contradiction and to pursuing exploratory and exploitative activities simulta-  neously, was not supported. Hypothesis 3, proposing a positive relationship between  senior team contingency rewards and ambidexterity, was supported (b = 1.82, p < 0.01).  In addition to the direct effects of senior team attributes on achieving ambidexterity,  we argued that their impact will be most pronounced when occurring in concert with  transformational leaders. This proposed interaction effect, however, was not significant  for transformational leadership and senior team shared vision (Hypothesis 4a not sup-  ported). Consistent with the hypothesis, the interaction effect between senior team social  integration and transformational leadership is significantly related to organizational  ambidexterity (b = 5.48, p < 0.01). To plot this interaction, senior team social integration  and transformational leadership took the values of one standard deviation below (i.e. low  level) and above (i.e. high level) the mean. The plot of the interaction is shown in  Figure 2. Consistent with Hypothesis 4b, Figure 1 shows a positive relationship between  senior team social integration and organizational ambidexterity when transformational  leadership is high. Interestingly, contrary to our Hypothesis 4c of a positive moderating  effect of transformational leadership on the relationship between senior team contin-  gency rewards and ambidexterity, the effect was negative and significantly related to a  J.

As plotted in Figure 3, organizations with  transformational leaders together with senior team contingency rewards are less condu-  cive to achieving ambidexterity than organizations with transformational leaders and  lower levels of contingency rewards.  To further verify our research findings, we conducted additional regression analyses  with the sum of exploratory and exploitative innovation as an alternative measurement  for organizational ambidexterity (Lubatkin et al., 2006). We repeated hypotheses tests  using this alternative measurement as dependent variable, and found similar results.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  Strategy scholars strive to understand the factors that impel organizations to explore and  exploit emergent opportunities so as to augment firm performance. Due to its theoretical  importance and practical relevance, research in this area is burgeoning. Conceptual  arguments assert that achieving ambidexterity imposes considerable challenges on senior  executives, because of the necessity to allow differentiation while maintaining integration  and balanced decision-making (Smith and Tushman, 2005). Senior teams in ambidex-  trous organizations are collectives of individuals responsible for resolving conflicting  strategic agendas while managing the operational functions for which they are respon-  sible. We posit that senior teams are important elements for ambidextrous organizations  to resolve conflicts and combine exploratory and exploitative activities in different parts  of the organization. Hence, we test this core idea to find that senior team attributes and  10  12  14  16  18  20  22  24  26  28  30  hgiHwoL  Senior team social integration  O  rg  an  iz  at  io  n  al   A  m  b  id  ex  te  ri  ty  Low Transformational  Leadership  High Transformational  Leadership  Figure 2.

Implications  Our results confirm that organizational ambidexterity requires the development of a  strong and compelling shared vision. A collective aspiration expresses the future develop-  mental path and can prevent ambidextrous organizations from leading into fragmented  structures (Hambrick, 1994). Our result also support assertions that common values and  aspirations are an important team attribute that facilitates senior team members to  prioritize and interpret problems and reduce conflicts (Simons et al., 1999). Another  conceptual extension introduced in the present study is that shared values and collective  goals facilitate team processes that compensate for spatial differentiation in ambidextrous  organizations. Orton and Weick (1990), for instance, argued that shared values may  constitute the sole remaining basis that holds together loosely-coupled exploratory and  exploitative units. In addition, Ouchi (1980) discussed that goal congruity may serve as  a central control mechanism that directs discipline and behaviour of organizational  members. A strong and compelling senior team shared vision, therefore, becomes a  primary mechanism for embracing conflicts that stem from senior team members occu-  pying multiple roles with potentially incompatible expectations. Shared values and  collective goals are associated with integrative and synergetic behaviours through which  senior teams balance requirements for resource allocation to both exploratory and  exploitative efforts.  Interestingly though, whereas a senior team shared vision is a positive and significant  predictor of organizational ambidexterity, our study fails to support the hypothesis that  senior team social integration enables reconciling conflicts within senior teams. Although we  expected social integration to increase efficiency of coordination and attention given to  overcome complex problems, our study reveals that it does not help senior teams to  reconcile conflicting demands and to allocate resources to both exploratory and exploit-  ative innovation. At first glance, the fact that socially integrated teams do not directly  favour the achievement of organizational ambidexterity seems inconsistent with prevail-  ing view that behavioural integration increases team effectiveness in ambidextrous or-  ganizations (Lubatkin et al., 2006). On close inspection, however, it is not. A possible  explanation could be that the attractiveness dimension of social integration might be  detrimental to openly discussing and debating conflicting demands. Mullen and Copper  (1994), for instance, found that the more the social integration tapped into interpersonal  attraction, themore social integration impaired group-decisionmaking. This would imply  that interpersonal attraction as an inherent part of social integration (Smith et al., 1994)  might decrease the willingness of senior team members to discuss and debate conflicting  demands and force the confrontation of competing goals and aspirations. Senior team  members in socially integrated teamsmight compromise confrontation of competing goals  associated with exploratory and exploitative units. Our study suggests that further  research is needed to evaluate the influence of the elements of social integration (i.e.  attraction to the team, satisfactionwith other teammembers, and social interaction among  team members) on the effectiveness of senior teams in ambidextrous organizations.  J. J. P. Jansen et al.998  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008  Another plausible explanation for the non-significant finding could be that the task  interdependency within senior teams is typically limited in scope and generally involves  only subsets of members. Senior team members in ambidextrous organizations may  sometimes work alone at independent tasks associated with their exploratory or exploit-  ative units and sometimes work together as a team. Meta-analytic results suggest that  teams exhibiting low to moderate levels of task interdependency benefit less from social  integration (Beal et al., 2003). Such hybrid forms of interdependencies have received  relatively little attention in the literature (e.g. Wageman, 1995), however, and might be  particularly important as they moderate the process and performance of senior teams in  ambidextrous organizations. More research is certainly necessary to address task inter-  dependency as an important characteristic and contingency condition for senior teams in  ambidextrous organizations.  Our findings on senior team contingency rewards highlight the importance of reward  systems in implementing complex strategic choices such as achieving organizational  ambidexterity. Whereas the literature on executive compensation has largely consid-  ered individual consequences of pay patterns, our study indicates that shared pay  patterns  can be expected to affect the functioning of senior teams in ambidextrous organiza-  tions (Siegel and Hambrick, 2005). Compensating senior team members for overall  firm performance decreases the chance of interest asymmetries and encourages senior  team members to seek opportunities for strategic synergies across inconsistent explor-  atory and exploitative organizational units. Senior team contingency rewards reduce  interpersonal competition and foster a firm wide view and collaboration (Edmondson  et al., 2003; Wageman, 1995) that prevents ambidextrous organizations from drifting  towards fragmented structures. Hence, our study contributes to recent insights con-  cerning the importance of team contingency rewards to enhancing organizational per-  formance under highly dynamic environmental conditions (Siegel and Hambrick,  2005) as we show that such ‘shared-fate’ rewards enable firms to combine exploratory  and exploitative efforts and to achieve organizational ambidexterity.  Our study’s findings on the moderating effect of transformational leadership also add to  the emergent dialogue on the level of discretion that leaders may possess over senior  team processes (Haleblian and Finkelstein, 1993; Peterson et al., 2003) and, conse-  quently, in influencing organizational ambidexterity. With regard to the effectiveness  of a shared senior team vision in ambidextrous organizations, however, our findings  did not provide evidence that transformational leaders facilitate the commitment to  and implementation of a senior team shared vision in ambidextrous organizations.  Although previous research has suggested that transformational leadership ensures the  attendance and understanding of a strategic direction (e.g. Berson and Avolio, 2004),  our non-significant finding might be explained by the fact that senior team members  may have a voice in determining the strategic direction. Through this increased  involvement, senior team members may already be committed to and perceive shared  goals and values as highly important to achieving organizational ambidexterity. In this  sense, the effect of transformational leaders emphasizing the ideological importance  diminishes yet may be particularly important to the effectiveness of organizational  members at lower hierarchical levels. Future research is necessary to explore this  Transformational Leadership 999  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008  possibility and examine how transformational leadership increases the effectiveness of  shared goals and values at lower levels within organizations.  Of particular interest is that senior team social integration only affects the achievement  of organizational ambidexterity in the presence of a transformational leader. Specifically,  socially integrated senior teams with a transformational leader aremore likely to reconcile  conflicting demands and debate about inconsistent perspectives at exploratory and  exploitative units. This finding has important implications. Together with the non-  significant direct effect of senior team social integration on organizational ambidexterity,  it highlights that transformational leaders are necessary to force socially integrated teams  to critically debate and openly discuss conflicting task issues. Socially integrated teamsmay  establish strong behavioural expectations, reduce deviant behaviour, and limit divergent  perspectives how to establish organizational ambidexterity (Rowley et al., 2000). Our  study indicates that socially integrated teams need inspirational and intellectual stimula-  tion on behalf of a transformational leader to debate conflicting interests and to reconcile  conflicting demands among senior team members in ambidextrous organizations.  Studies are beginning to address the idea that the use of rewards for performance may  be tied to transformational leadership (Goodwin et al., 2001). We expected transforma-  tional leaders to provide credit and expressions of satisfaction, and to influence senior  team members’ expectations about the fairness of group rewards for senior team per-  formance. Interestingly, however, our study shows that transformational leadership  negatively moderates the impact of senior team contingency rewards on achieving orga-  nizational ambidexterity. We speculate that this finding may be consistent with argu-  ments suggesting that transformational leaders emphasize intrinsic rather than extrinsic  rewards (Bono and Judge, 2003). Because senior team members become attracted by a  transformational leader’s inspirational motivation and intellectual stimulation, they may  implicitly assume they can trust the leader to provide rewards consistent with collective  performance. Shamir et al. (1993), for instance, argued that transformational leadership  motivates followers through intrinsic aspects, such as self-expression, self-efficacy, self-  worth, and self-consistency. Intrinsic motivation on behalf of senior team members, in  turn, diminishes perception about the importance of negotiating and implementing  extrinsic contingency senior team rewards that are tied to overall firm performance.  Hence, this result suggests that the effectiveness of senior team contingency rewards to  achieve organizational ambidexterity may be stifled when its leader exhibits transforma-  tional leadership behaviours. This finding encourages further research on the link  between transformational leadership, intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of contingency  rewards and achieving ambidexterity.  Limitations and Future Research  Although our study presents the first step towards uncovering the specific features of  senior teams and leadership behaviour in ambidextrous organizations, a number of  limitations call for further research. First, one possible shortcoming is that our hypoth-  eses, albeit generic, were tested at branches of a large financial services firm. Our focus  helped to control for corporate-, industry- and country-specific differences that might  have otherwise masked effects. Yet our focus may raise questions about the generaliz-  J. J. P. Jansen et al.1000  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008  ability of our findings to other industry settings. We demonstrated that specific senior  team attributes and leadership behaviour affect a firm’s ability to achieve organizational  ambidexterity. In other settings, some conditions may not hold, and the degree of  homogeneity among the branches may mean that the effects of study variables are  underestimated in our study. In addition, prior studies have shown that environmental  dynamism and uncertainty influence the discretion of executive directors over team  processes and outcomes. In less regulated and more dynamic and uncertain industry  settings, effects of transformational leadership on team attributes may be more pro-  nounced; however, the financial services sector has also been witnessing an increasing  extent of turbulence due to increased competition. With this in mind, there is reason to  believe that the salient features of our sample are evident in other industries as well. Of  course, this cannot be confirmed without more analyses offering a similar depth of  coverage.  Second, although we took great care in separating collection of data on the indepen-  dent and dependent variables as well as the use of multiple respondents that provide  valuable methodological contributions, future longitudinal research is necessary to  empirically establish the causal claim of our model. Third, as we averaged the items  pertaining to dimensions of transformational leadership to obtain a single index, it would  be useful to examine differential effects of each component of transformational leader-  ship. In this sense, future research may provide a richer assessment about the effective-  ness of each component of transformational leadership to senior team dynamics and  achieving organizational ambidexterity. Moreover, future studies may address how  transactional leadership influences the effectiveness of senior teams in ambidextrous  organizations. Finally, although our study provides new insights into how senior execu-  tives contribute to achieving organizational ambidexterity, it does not address perfor-  mance implications of achieving organizational ambidexterity. Although prior studies  have suggested that ambidexterity is a critical capability for success (i.e. Gibson and  Birkinshaw, 2004; He and Wong, 2004), future research exploring whether environmen-  tal dynamism and competitiveness are important boundary conditions, would be an  important extension of our study.  There are several other opportunities in which our findings could be extended both  theoretically and empirically. First, although our model focused on the senior team  attributes and transformational leadership behaviour, we did not directly examine team  decision-making processes. Senior team decision-making processes may have important  moderating or mediating influence on the relationship between senior team attributes  and organizational ambidexterity. Future research that incorporates measures of  decision-making such as speed, quality, and comprehensiveness may help explain more  variance in organizational ambidexterity. Second, our study variables provide partial  explanation of the phenomenon. Undoubtedly there are other important factors that  affect the ability of organizations to achieve organizational ambidexterity. For instance,  future research may investigate additional senior team attributes such as internal and  external social networks (i.e. content, strength, and density) as these dimensions have  been associated with team effectiveness and performance (Balkundi and Harrison, 2006).  Moreover, organizational determinants such as formal and informal integration mecha-  nisms may help implement differentiated exploratory and exploitative activities in a  Transformational Leadership 1001  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008  targeted integrated structure and further develop a firm’s ability to pursue exploratory  and exploitative innovation simultaneously. Third, future research on ambidextrous  organizations may take the notion of multiple levels into account. As our study investi-  gated close leadership effects on senior team dynamics and achieving organizational  ambidexterity, it would be useful to examine distant leadership effects on ambidextrous  behaviours at lower levels within organizations. Gibson and Birkinshaw (2004) suggested  that leaders may serve as role models who encourage organizational members at lower  hierarchical levels to make their own judgment about conflicting demands. Future  studies may also address exploration and exploitation at the manager level-of-analysis  (i.e. Mom et al., 2007) and examine how organizational and leader attributes affect  managers’ exploration and exploitation activities.  In conclusion, our study responds to calls for research on combining and synchroniz-  ing exploratory and exploitative innovations within organizations. The study not only  examines how senior teams might successfully coordinate pursuing exploratory and  exploitative innovations, but also reveals how transformational leadership might mod-  erate the effectiveness of senior teams in ambidextrous organizations. In doing so, this  study contributes to the management literature on ambidexterity and senior teams,  transformational leadership and capability development.

HEUGENS  Concordia University  FRANS A. J. VAN DEN BOSCH  CEES B. M. VAN RIEL  Erasmus University Rotterdam  This study examines the central contention of instrumental stakeholder theory—  namely, that firms that breed trust-based, cooperative ties with their stakeholders  will have a competitive advantage over firms that do not. A case study of the intro-  duction of genetically modified food products in the Netherlands provided the ba-  sis for the empirical analysis. The results support the instrumental stakeholder  management thesis, showing that stakeholder integration, through the develop-  ment of mutually enforcing relationships with external parties, may result in both  organizational learning and societal legitimacy.  The view that stakeholder management and beneficial corporate perfor-  mance go hand in hand has nowbecome commonplace in themanagement  literature (Donaldson & Preston, 1995). In the words of Freeman (1999),  “If organizations want to be effective, they will pay attention to all and  only those relationships that can affect or be affected by the achievement  of the organization’s purposes” (p. 234). Donaldson and Preston (1995)  have labeled the specific branch of stakeholder literature that seeks to  establish theoretical connections between such corporate practices and  firm performance “instrumental stakeholder theory.” Over the past  36  AUTHORS’NOTE: In its present form, this article grew out of a presentation at the 10th  Annual Conference of the International Association for Business and Society, June 24-28,  1999, Paris, France.

Recently, a number of empirical contributions have appeared in the lit-  erature that provide a direct test of the hypothesis that corporations whose  managers adopt stakeholder principles will show better financial perfor-  mance than those whose managers do not (Berman, Wicks, Kotha, &  Jones, 1999; Ogden & Watson, 1999). Donaldson and Preston (1995),  however, have commented critically on such empirical contributions:  “Whatever value the [studies examining the link between stakeholder  management and market performance] may have on their own merits,  most of themdo not include reliable indicators of the stakeholdermanage-  ment [italics added] (i.e., the independent variable) side of the relation-  ship” (p. 78).  In this article, we take this critique to heart and report on an in-depth  case study, aimed at theory building, that specifically examines the indica-  tors of instrumental (or strategic—cf. Berman et al., 1999) stakeholder  management. We set out to chart these indicators with the help of two  research questions. The first of these is as follows: What specific types of  stakeholder management do firms use to increase their market perfor-  mance? The second question is, What specific types of competitive bene-  fitsmight firms expectwhen they use these stakeholdermanagement tech-  niques? A detailed case study of the strategic stakeholder management  practices of firms in the Dutch foods industry during the recent introduc-  tion of genetically modified ingredients (covering the 1992-2000 period)  provides the empirical basis for our analysis.  We develop this article in the five following sections. First, we deduc-  tively generate a typology of stakeholder integration mechanisms, based  on two underlying theoretical dimensions (i.e., the locus and modus of  integration). Second, we briefly discuss the methods we used for our  empirical study. Third, we provide a case description in which we report  data on the attempts at stakeholder integration by the firms in our sample.  Fourth, we analyze this data to develop four propositions that link the vari-  ous stakeholder integration types to specific forms of competitive bene-  fits. Finally, we sum up with some brief concluding remarks.  THEORY DEVELOPMENT: A TYPOLOGY  OF STAKEHOLDER INTEGRATION TYPES  Instrumental theory in general posits that certain outcomes will obtain  if certain behaviors are adopted (Jones & Wicks, 1999). Instrumental  stakeholder theory in particular holds that “firms that contract (through  Heugens et al. / STAKEHOLDER INTEGRATION 37   © 2002 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

This particular strategy of obtaining a competitive  advantage through the development of close-knit ties with a broad range  of internal and external constituencies has been labeled “stakeholder inte-  gration” in the literature (Hart, 1995; Sharma & Vredenburg, 1998).  Empirically, however, the phenomenon appears in many different guises.  Examples range from employee stock ownership plans (Marens, Wicks,  & Huber, 1999) to stakeholder representation on corporations’ boards  (Luoma & Goodstein, 1999). We suggest two conceptual dimensions to  distinguish between these various types: the locus (“where?”) and the  modus (“how?”) of stakeholder integration.  Locus of Stakeholder Integration  In their task environments (Dill, 1958), organizations are confronted  with a variety of sources of uncertainty and interdependence (Bazerman  &Schoorman, 1983; Pfeffer&Salancik, 1978; Thompson, 1967). To han-  dle these problems effectively, organizations are forced to forge links with  the critical constituencies in their environment (Bresser & Harl, 1986;  Pfeffer, 1972; Selznick, 1949). As Schoorman, Bazerman, and Atkin  (1981) observed, “The management of an organization’s linkages to  financial institutions, suppliers, and customers may be just as crucial to  the effectiveness of the total organization as its internal management”  (p. 244).  Such linkages may take the form of dyadic relationships between the  firm and its most important stakeholders. In Freeman’s (1984) early work,  for example, the stakeholdermodel is presented as amap inwhich the firm  is the hub of a wheel and stakeholders are positioned at the ends of the  wheel’s spokes (cf. Frooman, 1999). This conceptualization suffices as  long as a firm can isolate its most important stakeholders. Freeman also  admitted, however, that a firm’s stakeholder environment often consists of  “a series of multilateral [italics added] contracts among stakeholders”  (Freeman&Evan, 1990, p. 354). In otherwords, because stakeholder rela-  tionships often occur in a network of influences, firms do not always  respond to each stakeholder individually but rather to the interaction of  multiple influences from the stakeholder environment (Rowley, 1997). In  sum, we suggest that the locus of stakeholder integration can either be the  dyad (one-on-one relationships between a firm and its stakeholders) or the  network (multilateral contracts between a firm and its stakeholders).  38 BUSINESS & SOCIETY / March 2002   © 2002 SAGE Publications.

One particularly effective way of dealing with outside pres-  sures is the establishment of boundary-spanning structures to signal com-  mitment to institutionalized beliefs and represent the organization favor-  ably to valued stakeholders (Aldrich, 1979; Edelman, 1992; Rao &  Sivakumar, 1999; Thompson, 1967). As Meyer and Rowan (1991)  remarked, adherence to such institutionally prescribed structures conveys  the message that an organization “is acting on collectively valued pur-  poses in a proper and adequate manner” (p. 50). External stakeholders  who observe these structures may consequently see the organization as  valuable and worthy of support (Suchman, 1995).  Not all strategies for managing outside dependence rely on structural  adaptations, however (Oliver, 1991; Pfeffer, 1972). Organizations may  also respond on amore informal basis to the pressure of specific centers of  power within a community (Selznick, 1949). External stakeholders may,  for example, be offered the opportunity to informally influence a corpora-  tion’s policy as a recognition of the resources they command (Frooman,  1999; Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). In particular, collaboration is often men-  tioned as an effective process for managing external dependencies and for  producing solutions to boundary-spanning problems that none of the par-  ties involved could achieve working independently (Gray, 1989). In this  modus of stakeholder integration, the emphasis is not on a particular struc-  tural adaptation but on interaction processes with external stakeholders.  Following Pettigrew and Whipp (1991), we label the latter approach  processual. In sum, the modus (or modus operandi) of stakeholder inte-  gration can either be structural (the creation of boundary-spanning struc-  tures) or processual (the development of informal means for managing  outside pressure).  Using the locus andmodus dimensions, one can construct a straightfor-  ward two-by-two typology of stakeholder integration forms (see Fig-  ure 1). Effectively, this typology provides a tentative conceptual answer to  our first research question.  Four Types of Stakeholder Integration  Buffering. Organizations in general aremotivated to secure enough sta-  bility and determinateness to preserve the efficiency and effectiveness of  their primary transformation processes (W. R. Scott, 1998). The need for  certainty induces many organizations to adopt buffering strategies, aimed  Heugens et al. / STAKEHOLDER INTEGRATION 39   © 2002 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

As a stakeholder integration mechanism,  buffering comes down to forging close links with representative organiza-  tions to avoid having to deal with many dispersed, anonymous, and there-  fore less controllable individual stakeholders. Rowley (1997) showed that  organizations facing many of these so-called indirect stakeholders are in a  vulnerable position because they are unable to influence the information  exchange processes in the stakeholder network. By developing boundary-  spanning structures with representatives of these indirect stakeholders,  they are able to buffer themselves from these network-level influences.  These structures enable them to preserve some autonomy regarding their  operational structure (Meyer & Rowan, 1991).  Co-optation. Organizations must also deal with direct stakeholders  (Rowley, 1997), who differ in their degree of perceived salience (Agle,  Mitchell, & Sonnenfeld, 1999; Mitchell, Agle, & Wood, 1997). With  respect to the most salient of a firm’s stakeholders, buffering is often not  an option, if only because some stakeholders actually contribute to a  firm’s technical core directly through investments in co-specialized assets  (Dyer & Singh, 1998; Teece, 1987). Organizations may manage the  uncertainty that results from such interdependencies through co-optation,  which has been defined by Selznick (1949) as “the process of absorbing  new elements into the leadership or policy-determining structure of an  organization as a means of averting threats to its stability or existence”  (p. 13). According to Pfeffer (1972), co-optation is a partial absorption  Locus dimension  Modus dimension  Dyad Network  Structural Co-optation Buffering  Processual Mutual learning Meta-problem solving  Figure 1.

Co-  optation is therefore a dyadic stakeholder integration technique, which  takes the form of adaptations to a firm’s leadership structure to obtain the  consent of external stakeholders or to use them as messengers that trans-  mit information ofmutual interest (Galaskiewicz, 1985; Pennings, 1981).  Mutual learning. Not all interdependencies between organizations and  their stakeholders need to be managed by means of structural adaptations  such as buffering or co-optation (Pfeffer & Nowak, 1976). Organizations  often face symbiotic interdependencies with other organizations—symbi-  osis being defined by Hawley (1950) as “a mutual dependence between  unlike organizations” (p. 36)—that are best managed through processual  adaptations. In particular, mutual learning is often noted as an especially  appropriate capitalization strategy (March & Simon, 1958; Powell,  Koput, & Smith-Doerr, 1996). Central to the mutual learning process is  the notion of reframing or redefining the symbiotic interdependence  between organization and stakeholder (Gray, 1989). Individual organiza-  tions are likely to bring their own feasibility preoccupations to the table,  which unnecessarily limits the range of cooperative options to a restricted  set. Through dyadic collaborative processes, however, symbiotically  interdependent parties may discover each other’s feasibility preoccupa-  tions and find a solution that incorporates at least some of the interests of  each of the stakeholders involved (Wood & Gray, 1991).  Meta-problem solving. Symbiotic interdependencies are not necessar-  ily restricted to the dyadic level but may extend to the network level  (Westley & Vredenburg, 1991, 1997). This happens, for example, when a  number of organizations face a joint problem domain that is ill-defined, a  problem domain in which relevant stakeholders are not defined a priori, or  a problem domain in which there are clear disparities in terms of power or  expertise among the parties involved (Gray, 1989). Such problemdomains  have been labeled meta-problems in the literature (Chevalier, 1966).  Because meta-problems transcend the boundaries of many individual  organizations, they must be addressed cooperatively by combining multi-  ple perspectives and resources for their resolution (Emery & Trist, 1965).  Alternatives such as incremental or unilateral efforts to deal with such  boundary-spanning problems typically produce less than satisfactory  solutions (Gray, 1989). Effective meta-problem solving, therefore, con-  sists of collaborative processes operative at the network level that help to  integrate organizations “that may be widely disparate in wealth, power,  Heugens et al. / STAKEHOLDER INTEGRATION 41   © 2002 SAGE Publications.

METHOD  To develop an instrumental theory of stakeholder integration that is  potentially testable, we conducted an in-depth case study of the dynamics  in the Dutch food industry during the recent introduction of genetically  modified ingredients. We selected this case because of the issue’s increas-  ing societal relevance and topicality. The level of controversy surrounding  the issue (Jardine, 1999; A. Scott, 1998) ensures that it meets the criteria  for an “extreme case” (Eisenhardt, 1989), one in which the process of  stakeholder integration is more urgent and transparent than in most other  cases.  After selecting geneticmodification as our object of study,wewere left  with an important question: What is our case (Miles & Huberman, 1994)?  Weused four cumulative demarcation criteria to drawaboundary between  what we would and would not study. First, the social unit we focused on  was the Dutch food industry and its stakeholders. It is important to note  that we analyzed both organization-level and industry-level dynamics,  reflecting an embedded case study methodology (Yin, 1994). Second, our  phenomenon of interest within this unit was the stakeholder integration  attempts of the firms represented in the industry. Third, the spatial bound-  aries we set for this study were the geographical borders of the Nether-  lands. In other words, we focused only on the local activities of the many  multinational enterprises in the area. Fourth and finally, we selected the years  1992 and 2000 as our lower and upper temporal boundaries, respectively.  Data Collection and Sampling  To gather firsthand knowledge of the stakeholder management prac-  tices of the Dutch food sector, we conducted so-called focused interviews  (Merton, Fiske, & Kendall, 1956) with a broad range of participants in the  genfoods issue. To obtain data that captured the greatest possible variation  in stakeholder management experiences, we selected a group of 23 key  players in the issue, following Glaser and Strauss’s (1967) notion of theo-  retical sampling in terms of theoretical relevance. More specifically, we  sought variationwith respect to the roles the various participants played in  the issue, as indicated both by the nature of the organizations that  employed them and by their job titles. A full listing of our interviewees is  presented in Table 1.  42 BUSINESS & SOCIETY / March 2002   © 2002 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

Most of our interview-  ees preferred us not to tape-record the conversations, so we decided not to  transcribe the interviews. Instead, we made detailed interview reports,  usually within 2 days after the data collection. In all, the interview reports  amounted to some 150 pages of double-spaced text.  We also used three additional data sources to “triangulate” (Denzin,  1989; Jick, 1979; Patton, 1987) our interview findings. First of all, we  were allowed to use the archives of the Product Board for Margarine, Fats,  and Oils, which contained personal correspondence (letters, faxes)  between members of the Product Board and industry representatives, as  well as brochures, scientific reports, minutes of meetings, and so forth.  Second, we were able to organize and participate in three roundtable dis-  cussions involving high-placed representatives from the Dutch food  industry.

Reliability and Validity  Reliability. In the present study, we have attempted to establish a mini-  mum degree of reliability by carefully documenting our data collection  and analysis procedures (Kidder & Judd, 1986; Yin, 1994). We have also  used an interview protocol with a minimal set of theoretically relevant  questions (analogous to Dutton & Dukerich, 1991), even though the inter-  views we conducted were typically open-ended and assumed a conversa-  tional manner. The use of this protocol, of which a short version is pre-  sented in Table 2, established at least a minimum degree of comparability  across the different interview reports.  44 BUSINESS & SOCIETY / March 2002  Table 2  Interview Protocol  Illustrative Questions  Position on biotechnology What is your official position on the use of  biotechnology?

Apel stressed that the production of valid knowledge presupposes an  understanding between the researchers and their respondents about what  the latter are actually doing. We sought to establish a community of inter-  pretation by means of the roundtable discussions. These occasions  allowed us repeatedly to enter into a discussion with a panel of industry  experts about the meaning and implications of our research findings.  Construct validity. To establish construct validity—the formulation of  correct operational measures for the concepts being studied (Kidder &  Judd, 1986)—we used two tactics. First, as noted above, we aimed at  establishing convergent lines of inquiry by using multiple sources of evi-  dence (Yin, 1994). Second, we had several versions of the case study  report reviewed by a number of key informants (N = 5). The rationale  behind this tactic is that informants and participantsmay disagreewith the  researchers’ conclusions and interpretations, but they may as a rule not  disagree over the actual facts of the case (Yin, 1994). The reviewers that  we used to verify our findings are numbered 1, 2, 5, 13, and 22 inTable 1.  CASE DESCRIPTION: STAKEHOLDER INTEGRATION  IN THE DUTCH FOOD INDUSTRY  During the period we investigated (1992-2000), the Dutch food indus-  try tried to deal with the issue of genetic modification collectively by  establishing three consecutive interorganizational platforms that were  intended to forge close relationships with their most salient stakeholders.  In order of initiation, these platformswere labeled InformalConsultations  onBiotechnology (1992-1995),TaskForce of theProductBoard forMarga-  rine, Fats, and Oils (1995-1998), and Project Team Biotechnology Product  Boards (1998-2000). Following the example of Dutton and Dukerich  (1991), we construct an event history of how these three platforms evolved.  We describe them in terms of key events, attributes of the arrangement, and  major responses adopted by the participating organizations.  Phase 1: Informal Consultations on Biotechnology  Key events. In response to the rapid scientific advancements in the field  of biotechnology, the EuropeanUnion adopted twomajor directives about  Heugens et al. / STAKEHOLDER INTEGRATION 45   © 2002 SAGE Publications.

The first of these  focussed on the deliberate release of transgenics into the natural environ-  ment, and the second focused on their use in contained environments such  as laboratories and factories. These two directives created additional con-  straints for European companies working in the biotechnology field. In  contrast, U.S.-based companies such as Monsanto and DuPont were less  hampered by regulations, because theU.S. Food andDrugAdministration  (FDA) decided in 1992 that altered foods had to meet the same standards  as all other foods but no new ones.  Attributes of the arrangement. In response to the new EU regulations, a  number of the key food- and ingredients-producing companies in the  Netherlands (e.g., Gist-Brocades, Numico, Unilever, and Sara Lee) initi-  ated a collaborative platform called “Informal Consultations on Biotech-  nology” in 1992. This collective effort emerged out of the awareness that  this particular issue permeated and transcended the boundaries of each  individual firm in the industry. A quote taken from a speech on the impact  of biotechnology by Morris Tabaksblat, at the time the chairperson of  Unilever, illustrates this awareness:  Whether you are buyers, traders, crushers, regulators, or [working] in an-  other sector of the foods business, you represent an enormous range of  products and sectors. It’s impressive to see how diverse and yet how closely  interdependent these different areas are. At the end of the day, however, we  all share the same ultimate goal—serving the consumer better. (Archives of  the Product Board for Margarine, Fats, and Oils)  The membership of this informal platform was not restricted to busi-  ness firms. The initiating organizations invited a number of  nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to participate in the consulta-  tions. Organizations such as the Consumer’s League and Nature & Envi-  ronment accepted the invitation.  Major responses. The purpose of the consultations was twofold. First,  the participantswanted to collect and share information ofmutual interest.  Second, the meetings were intended to initiate an open dialogue between  industry representatives and members of NGOs. Because the meetings  startedwell over 4 years before the actual introduction of geneticallymod-  ified ingredients in the Netherlands occurred, they allowed for the devel-  opment of communicative relationships between the parties long before  the public debate about biotechnology got heated.  46 BUSINESS & SOCIETY / March 2002   © 2002 SAGE Publications.

This  implied that the new variety could be grown and sold like any other bean.  Monsanto spent 1995 on producing seeds for commercialization, and in  1996, the first seeds found their way to U.S. farmers. Approximately 2%  of that year’s crop consisted of the new beans.  Attributes of the arrangement. Industry members realized that the  informal consultations were no longer the appropriate vehicle for manag-  ing the issue because the platform lacked staff, budget, and a clear man-  date. To fill the void, they appointed the Product Board for Margarine,  Fats, and Oils (a semipublic organization representing the interests of the  food industry) as their official spokesperson in the fall of 1995. The board  employs a permanent staff of around 30 people and is endowed with suffi-  cient budget (mostly through the compulsory contributions of industry  members). It was decided that the board would initiate a task force to  maintain close relationshipswith salient stakeholders during the introduc-  tion period.Whenwe asked one ofUnilever’smanagerswhy the company  conceded part of its autonomy in biotechnology affairs to the board, he  provided the following statement:1  We: Why did the industry appoint the Product Board as the central actor in this  issue?  R12: If you are serious about providing customer service, you need to use a  central information point. A worried mother does not want to dial twenty  different telephone numbers. From a consumer’s point of view, centraliza-  tion of responsibilities is the best alternative.  Major responses. The task force used a threefold strategy. First, it rec-  ognized the salience of the media in this issue and started organizing press  workshops to provide the journalists that reported on the topic with factu-  ally correct information. Second, it initiated a national information cam-  paign aimed at the general public featuring toll-free telephone lines and  brochures with background information. Third, it arranged a number of  informal meetings for industry representatives and NGOs in which the  parties could nurture the ties that they developed in the informal  consultations.

Novartis’ Bt-corn, a second modified crop after soy, was  introduced on the Dutch market in 1998.  Attributes of the arrangement. Corn does not belong to the jurisdiction  of the Product Board forMargarine, Fats, andOils, because the crop is pri-  marily used for animal feed and for the production of starch, not for the  extrusion of corn oil (which is only a marginal product). When we asked  the secretary of the boardwhat impact the new introductionwould have on  the board itself, he provided us with the following insight:  We: What does [the introduction of Bt-corn] imply for this organization?  R01: Currently, the newly introduced crops transcend the level of responsibil-  ity of the individual Product Boards. At the same time, consumers do not  distinguish between the various introductions. This is why we intend to  coordinate more of our efforts with the other Boards.  Soon thereafter, the board established more formal linkages with the  boards that are responsible for the introduction of Bt-corn, namely, the  Product Board for Animal Feed and the Product Board for Grains, Seeds,  and Legumes. Jointly they established the Project Team Biotechnology  Product Boards.  Major responses. The Project Team “absorbed” all the capabilities,  resources, and contacts of the Task Force and added additional funds and  staff. It is therefore not surprising that the methods of the project team for  dealing with the issue reflect those of the Task Force. The team composes  “fact packs” of every new introduction, which are distributed among the  affected stakeholders, and this contributes to an open dialogue between  scientists, the national government, and NGOs. Also, the initiative of  press workshops has been continued, and the Project Team has started a  public information campaign about Bt-corn, featuring a toll-free tele-  phone line and free brochures.  CASE ANALYSIS: STAKEHOLDER INTEGRATION  AND COMPETITIVE BENEFITS  The three platforms described above can be understood as stakeholder  integration attempts, ranging from highly process-oriented initiatives (the  Informal Consultations on Biotechnology) to very formal structural solu-  tions (the Project Team Biotechnology Product Boards). Furthermore,  48 BUSINESS & SOCIETY / March 2002   © 2002 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

In this section, we will link these various forms  to competitive benefits that firms in the Dutch food industry experienced  as a result of their stakeholder integration attempts.  Cognitive Legitimacy  We previously asserted that buffering entails the establishment of tight  linkages with representative organizations to avoid having to deal with  widely dispersed individual stakeholders. These linkages shield the orga-  nization from environmental uncertainty by stabilizing external influ-  ences and making them more predictable. In essence, buffering mecha-  nisms raise the organizational boundaries higher to shut out unwanted  influences on corporate policy and operations (Harrison & St. John,  1996). The companies in the Dutch food industry have attempted to raise  the boundaries between themselves and critical third parties in the 1992-  1995 period by developing relationships with their representative organi-  zations through the informal consultations. One of our interviewees  reflected on these buffering attempts as follows:  We: What has your company learned from its cooperative relationships with  the organizations representing third parties in the informal consultations?  R14: What we have learned . . . is that it is important not to create a new plat-  form for every new issue. Consumers do not distinguish between introduc-  tions. They are not interested in the differences between modified soy and  modified corn, so it is better if they receive their information regarding the  entire “menu” of [modified] agricultural products from a single organiza-  tion. You must respect existing channels, so to speak.  Perhaps the most influential representative organization in the Nether-  lands is the official Consumer’s League. With its 640,000 members, it is  the largest consumer’s league in Europe, and in relative terms, it is even  the largest league in the world (www.consumentenbond.nl). Because of  its sheer size and its influence on consumers, the league plays a critical  role in the production of stability in the food industry’s task environment.  It is therefore not a surprise that many of the industry’s stakeholder inte-  gration attempts have been oriented toward this consumer representative  organization. Consumer & Biotechnology, a subsidiary of the official  Consumer’s League, at one point decided to join the Informal  Heugens et al. / STAKEHOLDER INTEGRATION 49   © 2002 SAGE Publications.

When we asked one of their policy directors why, he gave  the following explanation:  We: By participating in the informal consultations, Consumer & Biotechnol-  ogy strongly signals its commitment to biotechnology to the public at large.  Why has your organization chosen to join the platform?  R10:Becausewe do not think that informing the public is a task for the national  government. And also because we think that the parties in the private sector  are a little too eager to provide only that information that suits their interests  best. Therefore, we have decided, in conjunction with the food industry, to  inform the public at large for them. In return, we receive early access to new  information.  The endorsement of such influential third parties is critical, because  affirmative backing may transform the organization’s position into an  intersubjective “given” that is no longer open for discussion (Suchman,  1995). The organization then acquires a state of “taken-for-grantedness”  (Jepperson, 1991; Zucker, 1983) that Aldrich and Fiol (1994) describe as  “cognitive legitimacy.” As Aldrich (1999) explained, “The highest form  of cognitive legitimacy exists when a product, process, or service is  accepted as part of the sociocultural and organizational landscape”  (p. 230). Therefore, we put forward the following proposition:  Proposition 1:The creation of stakeholder integration structures at the network  level (i.e., buffering) leads to the establishment of cognitive legitimacy on  behalf of the organization as perceived by its stakeholders.  Sociopolitical Legitimacy  Another way of improving upon the predictability of changes in the  external environment is to engage in direct, bilateral relationships with  external stakeholders (Harrison & St. John, 1996). Organizations may  seek to establish linkages with stakeholders that they cannot or should not  buffer from their technical cores. To this end, managers invest consider-  able amounts of time and resources in organizational actions that serve no  other purpose than to get acquainted with such critical outside parties.  When we asked one of our interviewees (working for the largest Dutch  retailing organization) for his experienceswith such activities, the conver-  sation went as follows:  We:What types of activities does your company pursue in order to inform itself  about the parties involved with the genfoods issue?  R19: As a retailer, we are very close to the final consumer. They visit our shops  frequently, and they are our most important external constituency. We  50 BUSINESS & SOCIETY / March 2002   © 2002 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, the Dutch food industry as a whole tried to establish  structural linkageswith the national government proactively, in an attempt  to preserve its autonomy in biotechnology-related affairs. When we asked  a high-placed official working for the Ministry of Economic Affairs for  his opinion with respect to these matters, he provided the following  account:  We: The industry has clearly opted for self-regulation in this issue. Why hasn’t  the national government demanded to receive a larger say?  R07: We have decided not to intervene in the process because the industry  informs us well. We often meet one another in a range of different settings,  such as the Communicative Consultations on Biotechnology and the Regu-  lar Consultations of the Food and Drug Administration. That is how we  keep a finger on the pulse.  By allowing government officials to exert (some) informal influence  over their biotechnology policies, theDutch food producing organizations  displayed their “willingness to relinquish some measure of authority to  the affected audience” (Suchman, 1995, p. 578). Such co-optation prac-  tices turn audiences into constituencies (Wood, 1991), providing the  co-opting organizations with what Aldrich and Fiol (1994) called  “sociopolitical legitimacy.” Aldrich (1999) has defined this form of legiti-  macy as “the acceptance by key stakeholders . . . of a [technology] as  appropriate and right” (p. 230). Therefore, we put forward a second  proposition:  Proposition 2: The creation of stakeholder integration structures at the dyadic  level (i.e., co-optation) leads to the establishment of sociopolitical legiti-  macy on behalf of the organization as perceived by its stakeholders.  Symbiotic Learning Effects  Not just structural forms of stakeholder integration can lead to compet-  itive benefits. More informal collaborative processes may yield equally  valuable results. One beneficial outcome could be a higher percentage of  successful innovations resulting from the involvement of stakeholders in  product/service design teams (Harrison & St. John, 1996). Another exam-  ple is the improvement of a company’s media relations by incorporating  the needs and preferences of journalists in its media policies. Unilever, for  instance, was one of the companies that recognized early in the intro-  Heugens et al. / STAKEHOLDER INTEGRATION 51   © 2002 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

The company fine-tuned its press relations by  listening to critical journalists and changing its media policy accordingly.  We discovered this when we spoke to a journalist from one of the leading  Dutch newspapers:  We: Why do you have such high regards for the people at Unilever?  R21: They [have learned to] understand my profession. What matters to me is  that I have a personal contact person inside the organization. I don’t want to  speak to some kind of Public Relations official, because they are only a bur-  den. Unilever lets me speak to people that are of interest to me.  This example illustrates an important characteristic of collaborative  relationships, notably that groups that have differing interests at the start  of a collaborative venture may redefine and potentially align their inter-  ests as the collaboration proceeds (Gray, 1989; Wood & Gray, 1991). We  label this process symbiotic learning, the discovery of mutual feasibility  preoccupations by interdependent but unlike organizations (cf. Hawley,  1950). Organizations do not have an equal capacity to learn from all other  organizations, however, because they are inclined to learn more from par-  ties that have comparable knowledge bases and dominant logics (Lane &  Lubatkin, 1998). The following quote, derived from an interview with the  coordinator of biotechnology-related matters of the Dutch Ministry of  Agriculture, illustrates this particular phenomenon:  We: How would you describe your relationship with the other ministries with a  stake in modern biotechnology as compared to your relationship with  industry members?  R08: There is definitely a difference. The Ministries of Agriculture, Economic  Affairs, and Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment are often on  the samewavelength. The heterogeneitywithin the industry ismuch greater  than that between the ministries. It is much easier for us to share our experi-  ences with other ministries than to disseminate them amongst private  parties.  This quote illustrates that symbiotic learning is most likely to occur  between organizations that are sufficiently dissimilar as to have relevant  differences in terms of their respective knowledge stocks but that are at the  same time sufficiently similar to stimulate a smooth transfer of informa-  tion. Verify with the following proposition:  Proposition 3: Stakeholder integration processes at the dyadic level (i.e.,  mutual learning) result in symbiotic learning effects between organizations  and their stakeholders.  52 BUSINESS & SOCIETY / March 2002   © 2002 SAGE Publications.

Such partnering  activities allow firms to build bridges with their stakeholders in pursuit of  common goals, whereas traditional company-centered stakeholder man-  agement techniques only facilitate the satisfaction of stakeholder needs  (Harrison & St. John, 1996). When we asked the secretary of the Product  Board for Margarine, Fats, and Oils what the firms his organization repre-  sents had actually gained from their involvement with the issue, the dis-  cussion went as follows:  We: What has the industry as a whole learned from the introduction of modern  biotechnology?  R01: Thatwe can only succeed in keeping this issue atmanageable proportions  if we, on the one hand, maintain our good relationships with what we call  “bridgeable partners.” On the other, we must continue to inform the  “unbridgeables,” those stakeholders that are against biotechnology and that  do not want to compromise. Maintaining our dialogue with them, and sup-  plying them with information, are key.  Insights such as these result from what is sometimes called “the con-  structivemanagement of differences” (Gray, 1989; Pasquero, 1991). Gray  (1989) noted that there can be no positive symbiosis between parties in the  absence of differences in terms of interest and insight between them. The  director of Public Affairs of Gist Brocades (currently DSM) provided  another illustration of such learning in the face of different perceptions.  During the interview, he explained to us that product development at Gist  is mainly an interdisciplinary activity. The conversation proceeded as  follows:  We: But can you tell me why your company develops new products in interdis-  ciplinary teams?  R17: For years, we have regarded ourselves as a research and development  organization that happened to sell products on the side.As you know,we are  mainly operative in business-to-business markets, that’s why. Our involve-  mentwithmodern biotechnologywas a big eye-opener for us, however. The  level of controversy that we met when we introduced a number of genetic  engineering-based products was unprecedented for us. Since then, we have  started to integrate our research and development centermorewith ourmar-  keting and public affairs departments.  It is precisely the collective learning that results from the exploration of  different viewpoints that has led this organization to improve upon its  Heugens et al. / STAKEHOLDER INTEGRATION 53   © 2002 SAGE Publications.

We therefore  posit the following proposition:  Proposition 4: Stakeholder integration processes at the network level (i.e.,  meta-problem solving) result in collective learning effects between organi-  zations and their stakeholders.  This fourth proposition completes our efforts at linking the four con-  ceptual types of stakeholder integration to an equal number of distinct,  empirically observable competitive benefits that may potentially enhance  the market performance of commercial organizations. The identification  of these four benefits effectively answers our second research question.  These benefits are once again linked to themodus and locus dimensions of  stakeholder integration in Figure 2.  The quotations presented in this article are mainly meant as empirical  illustrations of the propositionswe forwarded. As a rule, such illustrations  cannot be regarded as empirical evidence that could lead to the acceptance  or rejection of such propositions as true knowledge claims, because they  fail to indicate the extent to which these relationships are supported by the  data.Nevertheless, to demonstrate some of the patterns in our findings,we  have included some additional information on the frequencies with which  certain key constructs (i.e., stakeholder integration types and competitive  benefits) have been observed empirically (see Table 3).  54 BUSINESS & SOCIETY / March 2002  Locus dimension  Modus dimension  Dyad Network  Structural Sociopolitical  Legitimacy  Cognitive  Legitimacy  Processual  Symbiotic  Learning  Effects  Collective  Learning  Effects  Figure 2.

We explored this contention with the help of  two more detailed research questions. The first was, What specific types  of stakeholder management do firms use to increase their market perfor-  mance? The second was, What specific types of competitive benefits might  firms expect when they use these stakeholder management techniques?  We addressed the first question in three steps. First, after a brief exami-  nation of the stakeholder literature, we concluded that the development of  mutually enforcing relationships with external constituencies is broadly  seen as the dominant pathway toward excellent market performance  (Freeman, 1984, 1999; Hart, 1995; Jones, 1995; Sharma & Vredenburg,  1998). Second, we suggested a typology of stakeholder integration based  on two dimensions—locus (dyad versus network) and modus (structural  versus processual)—to distinguish between the various empirical guises  of the phenomenon (see Figure 1). We labeled these buffering (network/  structural), co-optation (dyad/structural), mutual learning (dyad/  processual), and meta-problem solving (network/processual). Third, we  juxtaposed this typology with empirical observations derived from a  detailed case study of the Dutch food industry’s stakeholder management  practices during the introduction of genetically modified ingredients.

We found four, each of which corresponded  closely to a specific integration type (see Figure 2). First, buffering allows  organizations to reach widely dispersed stakeholders through their repre-  sentative organizations. The affirmative backing of these representatives  bestows cognitive legitimacy, or taken-for-grantedness (Jepperson, 1991;  Zucker, 1983), upon the buffering organization. Second, co-optation  allows for the neutralization of key external constituents by including  them in policy-determining structures (Emerson, 1962; Selznick, 1949;  Zald, 1969). This provides the co-opting organization with sociopolitical  legitimacy (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994). Third, engaging in collaborative pro-  cesses at the dyadic level can allow parties to discover their mutual feasi-  bility preoccupations (Gray, 1989; Turcotte, 1997; Wood & Gray, 1991).  Drawing on Hawley’s (1950) concept of symbiosis, we labeled this effect  symbiotic learning. Finally, firms can capitalize on network-level interde-  pendencies by combining perspectives not readily found under a single  roof (Powell, 1998; Powell et al., 1996). We have labeled the outcomes  that result from this constructive management of differences (Gray, 1989;  Pasquero, 1991) collective learning.  It is important to note that the competitive benefits that have accrued to  the Dutch food producing companies have not necessarily generated a  competitive advantage for some firms in the food industry over all the oth-  ers. The processes of institutionalization and societal acceptation of mod-  ern biotechnology benefit all firms involved with this new method of pro-  duction. Furthermore, symbiotic and collective learning processes are  likely to benefit all of the collaborating parties, not just a selected number  of them. Schelling’s (1960) concept of nonzero-sumgames is insightful in  this respect. Because the benefits of legitimization and learning poten-  tially accrue to all firms in the Dutch food industry, they do not result in a  redistribution of the pie in the sense that they help some firms outperform  others. Instead, they effectively enlarge the pie, leading to an enhanced sit-  uation for all of the parties involved.  In sum, the present research has identified some stakeholder integra-  tion mechanisms that could become important “indicators of stakeholder  management” (Donaldson&Preston, 1995, p. 78).We believe that further  theoretical development in the instrumental stakeholder field relies at  least in part on the identification of indicators of this kind as well as on  their inclusion in credible theory-testing research. We also believe that  organizations that want to manage their external relations efficaciously  should pay attention to such stakeholder integration mechanisms because  they can offer them the leverage required to achieve their purposes  56 BUSINESS & SOCIETY / March 2002   © 2002 SAGE Publications.

Hence, the message that practicing managers may  derive from this article is that their companies may derive very concrete  competitive benefits from building mutually enforcing relationships with  their external stakeholders.

49  Strategic Issue Management in  Major European!Based Companies  M. J. H. Oomens and F. A. J. van den Bosch  THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH MULTINATIONAL com-  panies operate is becoming increasingly turbulent  and complex. Public opinion and individual norms  and values have changed, and society’s expectations  and the demands it makes to companies are now  higher than before. Large organisations are being  asked to behave in a socially responsible way and to  pay considerably more attention to the interests of  various internal and external stakeholders. These  self-appointed stakeholders can raise strategic issues  which have a serious impact on a company’s per-  formance and reputation. If these issues are not prop-  erly managed, they can escalate and cause negative  publicity and financial damage. A well-known exam-  ple of such an issue is the commotion caused for Shell  over the dumping of the Brent Spar oil platform in  the North Sea.1  From a managerial point of view, a key question is:  ‘‘How should companies prepare themselves to deal  effectively with strategic issues?’’ As a response to the  increased social pressures and the public criticism of  their behaviour and actions, many corporations have  started organising for ‘Issue Management’, i.e.,  developing a systematic process by which the com-  pany can identify, evaluate, and respond to strategic  issues affecting the company.  The academic literature on Issue Management  mainly stems from American contexts and focuses on  topics such as the development and necessity of Issue  Management, Issue Identification and Interpretation,  Issue Life Cycles, Issue Response Development, and  Issue Management Process models. Little attention,  however, has been paid to how Issue Management  should be organised and who should be responsible  for strategic issues in large international firms. Some  scholars have recognised this. Greening,2 for example,  states that ‘‘very little research has been done on how  Pergamon Long Range Planning, Vol. 32, No. 1, pp. 49 to 57, 1999  PII: S0024–6301(98)00124–1 © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved  Printed in Great Britain  0024–6301/99 $—see front matter  \  The purpose of this study is to contribute to the  development of an integrated managerial  framework for identifying, managing and  organising responses to strategic issues in  multinational enterprises. To this end, we  distinguish three key elements of strategic issues,  three different forms of organisational  involvement, and two ways of allocating  managerial responsibilities. The framework is  illustrated with the results of empirical  research within four European-based  multinational enterprises. © 1999 Elsevier  Science Ltd. All rights reserved  the process of managing responses to issues is struc-  tured within firms.’’  Given the need for a managerial perspective in  Issue Management, a perspective lacking in both the  literature and practice, as well as the importance of  dealing with Issue Management in a European  context, a research study on this subject was carried  out in 1997. The research question was: ‘‘What key  factors in organisational and managerial processes  play an essential role in Issue Management within  European-based multinational companies?’’ The  research method consisted of reviewing the literature  and producing case studies of four European-based  multinational companies. The companies operated  in different industries and were of different sizes,  ranging from 30,000 to more than 200,000 employees.  To keep the case studies confidential, we have lab-  elled the companies W, X, Y, and Z.  The four case studies were based on information  from public documents (annual reports, speeches, art-  50  icles, press releases), internal documents (memos,  policy briefs, organisation charts, brochures) and,  most importantly, a series of semi-structured inter-  views. At each company, five to ten interviews were  held at different organisational levels (mostly cor-  porate and operating levels), with people having vari-  ous functions in the organisation, both staff directors  and line managers. The interviews lasted one and a  half hours on average. After writing the four case  studies, a comparative analysis was made. By com-  paring the empirical research with conclusions from  the existing literature we produced an integrated  framework describing different approaches to the  management of strategic issues and the organisational  forms which are used.  In this article, we build on the results of this  research study, a review of the literature, and insights  gained from the case studies to develop an integrated  managerial framework and to explain how it may be  used in practice. The framework relates different  ways of managing and organising for issues to three  key elements of strategic issues. Also, it explains the  importance of the management’s attitudes to the  ‘‘stakeholders’’ in particular, whether they are reac-  tive or proactive since this influences the possibility  of strategic choice in responding to issues.  Perspectives On Strategic Issues  The analyst can adopt three perspectives when exam-  ining strategic issues: i.e. a Strategy perspective, a  Business and Society perspective, and a Public Policy  perspective. These perspectives are reflected in the  academic literature. Igor Ansoff,3 one of the first sch-  olars in the strategy field who analysed the import-  ance of strategic issues, defined a strategic issue as:  ‘‘. . . a forthcoming development, either inside or out-  side of the organisation, which is likely to have an  important impact on the ability of the enterprise to  meet its objective.’’ The strategy literature pays par-  ticular attention to the impact which strategic issues  may have on a company. The Business and Society  literature on strategic issues focuses on the potential  gap between the company’s actual performance and  the performance which is perceived or expected by  the company’s stakeholders. This is reflected in the  description given by one of the prominent scholars in  the field: James Post4 defines a strategic issue as ‘‘. . . a  gap . . . between what the organisation’s relevant pub-  lics expect its performance to be and the organ-  isation’s actual performance.’’ The Public Policy  perspective traditionally stresses the controversial  aspect of strategic issues: how to reconcile the con-  flicting claims of the external stakeholders as the legit-  imate representatives of society.  Wartick & Mahon5 tried to integrate these three dif-  ferent perspectives in the literature on strategic  Strategic Issue Management in Major European-Based Companies  TABLE 1. Strategic issues: three key elements  Element Perspective  Gap in expectations Business & society  Controversy (i.e. conflict of Public policy  interests)  Impact on the firm Strategic management  Source: Adapted from Wartick & Mahon (1994).  issues. They suggested that a corporate strategic issue  has three key elements: Gap, Controversy, and Impact  (see Table 1). Extending the approach of Wartick &  Mahon, we propose to consider these three attributes  in sequence. A strategic issue is based on Gaps which  arise between the perceptions of management and  other stakeholders regarding corporate performance.  These Gaps may give rise to Controversies which may  have a significant present or future Impact on the  organisation. Looking at these elements in a sequen-  tial way suggests that companies can be involved in  managing strategic issues from the very beginning  (the Gap stage), from the Controversy stage or at the  Impact stage.  In our research, we tried to determine the question  whether the strategic issue definitions used by the  four multinationals implicitly or explicitly reflected  these three key elements and to what extent. We gath-  ered descriptions of strategic issues used in the four  companies from various internal documents, from  visits to different departments (e.g., public relations,  external affairs, strategy) and from interviews with  personnel responsible for managing strategic issues.  In company X a strategic issue was described as fol-  lows: ‘‘We consider topics that can exert an important  influence on our Group as strategic issues.’’ This  description focuses on the Impact. In company Z  management explained that: ‘‘conflicts with external  stakeholders are the source of strategic issues.’’ This  description explicitly refers to the Controversy  element and implies also a Gap in expectations.  Our analysis of the descriptions used by both of  these companies revealed that they usually refer to  the Impact. However, there was a striking difference  between the two companies in the frequency with  which the Gap was mentioned. Practically all the  descriptions of strategic issues from company Z men-  tioned the Gap. In contrast, company X’s descriptions  of strategic issues mentioned in particular the Impact.  This may indicate that company Z has more possi-  bilities for proactive strategies than company X.  Organising For Strategic Issues  As interest in Issue Management has grown, a con-  siderable number of articles (mostly by American  51  authors) have appeared in the 1980s and 90s con-  cerning the history, development, and necessity of  Issue Management, Issue Identification and Interpret-  ation,6 Issue Life Cycles,7 Issue Response Devel-  opment,8 and models describing the Issue  Management process in several steps.9–11  However, research into the question of how to  organise for Strategic Issue Management and what  basic organisational forms can be distinguished is  scarce, and the few earlier contributions that do  exist12 lack an integrated managerial framework.  Given the primarily external focus of both the Busi-  ness and Society, and the Public Policy perspective, it  is clear that the corresponding literature and research  findings do not offer many clues. As Table 1 suggests,  the literature presented from the Strategy Perspective  should, however, give more clues to this question. In  this respect, one of the most substantial contributions  based on both theoretical and empirical work is Lenz  & Engledow’s13 analysis of the organisational struc-  ture of environmental analysis units in leading U.S.  corporations. Although this analysis does not pri-  marily deal with Strategic Issue Management, their  findings imply that companies can be organised to  cope with strategic issues in a ‘strategic planning-  integrated’ way or in a more ‘function-oriented’ way.  In the latter case, the focus of environmental analysis  is functional area-specific. Elaborating on their analy-  sis and using a Strategy Perspective, we suggest that  there are three ways of organising for strategic issues:  Corporate Level, Functional Level, and Process-Ori-  ented; see Fig. 1.  The three forms in Fig. 1 differ regarding a number  of characteristics. For example, the analysis in the  first form is at the corporate level, while in the pro-  cess-oriented organisation, the business level and the  local operating companies play a key role. The  location and the focus of the analysis influence the  decision-making on strategic issues. If the analysis is  made at the corporate level and the focus is on cor-  porate issues, decision-making tends to be central-  ised. If the location and the focus of the analysis are  at the business and operating company levels, this  produces a more decentralised decision-making pro-  cess. So, the three organisational approaches imply a  low, medium, and high organisation-wide involve-  ment.  These three analytical forms were useful in  researching the question of ‘‘How are European-based  multinationals organised for Strategic Issue Man-  agement?’’ Of the four companies investigated, Com-  pany Z uses the Process-Oriented approach and  Company X primarily uses a Corporate-level  approach. Of the other two companies, one resembles  the Functional-level form and the other uses a mix-  ture of the Corporate-level and Process-Oriented  approaches. However, all four companies were  involved in reorganising their organisational struc-  Long Range Planning Vol. 32 January 1999  ture in directions that would facilitate the Process-  Oriented approach to Strategic Issue Management.  We will focus upon the two extremes regarding the  extent of organisation-wide involvement: companies  X and Z.  Allocating Managerial  Responsibilities  Scholars have devoted a great deal of time and effort to  drawing up models presenting the Issue Management  process as a sequence of steps to be executed.14–16 In  general, the following steps can be found in these  models: Scanning or Monitoring the Environment,  Issue Identification, Prioritisation, Analysis, Strategic  Decisions & Action Programs, Implementation, and  Evaluation. Although these models make clear the  core tasks to be executed in the management of issues,  they do not answer the key questions of who is respon-  sible for Issue Management. Several questions can be  raised including: How should management coor-  dinate and communicate efficiently, especially in a  large international organisation? Who is responsible  for identifying these strategic issues in good time and  managing the actions of the company effectively?  Issue Allocation  We believe that another step should be considered in  the Issue Management process: i.e. Issue Allocation.  As soon as important strategic issues have been ident-  ified, they should be ‘allocated’ to a particular person,  in staff or in line management, who will be respon-  sible for monitoring and managing it. During our case  study research, we discovered a new concept, until  now not mentioned in the literature, but being prac-  tised by all four multinational companies in the field  study: ‘Issue Ownership’. However, the companies  used this concept for different people with different  functions. Two companies (one of them company Z)  allocated strategic issues after their identification  directly to line managers, since they had the power  to decide what should happen and could act right  away if necessary. Of course, these line managers  could delegate certain tasks to others, and rely on staff  members to coordinate the information flows and give  expert advice and support. We considered the line  managers as the ‘real’ issue owners, as they had the  associated ‘duties and rights’ to decide and to act  which owners normally have.  The other two companies (one of them being com-  pany X) had a different way of allocating managerial  responsibilities. After the issues were identified, they  were assigned to corporate staff directors, who were  responsible for disseminating information about the  issue. They were also responsible for monitoring the  issue, keeping up to date on its status, filing docu-  ments, staying well informed on further devel-  52  Characteristics:  Location of analysis  Focus of analysis  Decision–making  Extent of  organisation–wide  Corporate Level  Corporate staff  Corporate issues  Centralised  Low  Functional Level  Functional  Functional area  departments  issues  Largely Centralised  Medium  Process–Oriented  Business Unit &  Corporate, Business  Operating Companies  & Local issues  Decentralised  High  involvement     FIGURE 1.

When the company began to experi-  ence a significant impact, line management in that  part of the company became involved, and they were  responsible for managing the actual issue and for tak-  ing action. At this point, the line management often  contacted staff members for advice and support.  To distinguish their role from that of the ‘Issue  Owner’, we suggest that the corporate staff directors  might be called ‘Issue Guardians’. These staff mem-  bers ‘guard’ or monitor the issue and collect infor-  mation about it until line management takes over.  Therefore, we can distinguish two possible situations:  (1) Issue allocation to line managers, referred to as  Issue Owners; (2) Issue allocation to managers in staff  departments, which we might call Issue Guardians.  There is a general consensus in the literature that  senior line managers should be made responsible for  important strategic issues and that staff members  should play a supporting, advising and coordinating  role.17–20 So, writers recommend the appointment of  Issue Owners, not recognising the second option of  Strategic Issue Management in Major European-Based Companies  Issue Guardians that exists in practice. There is also  consensus that Issue Management should be part of  the strategic decision-making processes, i.e. formal  planning and appraisal sessions, and that top man-  agement commitment to Issue Management is  crucial.2,3,13,21,22  These findings are largely corroborated in practice,  in spite of the variations found in the multinational  companies included in the field study. In all four  companies line managers are eventually made respon-  sible for the management of strategic issues, whether  they use the Issue Owner or Issue Guardian approach.  However, there are major differences in the degree of  managerial involvement. The differences occur in the  timing of line management involvement: early in  time, in the Gap-stage, or later when the issue begins  to have a serious Impact on the company. In Fig. 2,  these situations are described, indicating the tasks of  staff members (support or sole responsibility).  Figure 2 shows two extreme levels of managerial  involvement: (1) High, where line managers are  involved from the beginning, while staff members (at  53  Issue Owner  Issue Guardian  High  Low  Time  1.

Most authors in the literature advocate a high level  of managerial involvement, staff support and the use  of line managers as Issue Owners. However, the  second option, with staff members as Issue Guardians  with ad hoc and informal contact between staff and  line management (later in time) could also be effec-  tive, depending on the organisational form that is  chosen. The low managerial involvement option  could fit in with an equally low level of organisational  involvement, in the sense that only the (centralised)  corporate level is active in the area of Issue Manage-  ment. Corporate staff members can think ahead, moni-  toring developments, identifying potential issues and  keeping information up-to-date. In this way, staff  members can prepare themselves in advance and have  corporate statements ready to use when managerial  reaction is needed in the Impact stage of a strategic  issue in a business division or an operational  company. These companies can afford to wait to react  until an issue is in the late Controversy or Impact-  stages, either because the corporate level has the  Long Range Planning Vol. 32 January 1999  authority to decide what to do in specific cases, or  because line managers can immediately contact the  corporate level when there is a problem, and they  will have instant access to advice and up-to-date  information.  However, to be successful this second option  requires timely, fast and effective communication and  coordination between the corporate level and other  parts of the company. Also, the corporate staff must  have sufficient authority to react or be able to provide  advice and support rapidly, otherwise the issue may  escalate, as it is already in an advanced stage. Decent-  ralised organisations may therefore have problems  managing issues along these lines.  Towards An Integrated Managerial  Framework  An integrated managerial framework for Strategic  Issue Management has to cover at least three impor-  tant aspects: (1) the key elements of strategic issues  and their sequential nature, necessitating a dynamic  54  High:   Process–Orientated approach  Low:   Corporate–level approach  Low: Staff High: Line  Managerial   Involvement  Company X:   managerial reaction   on Impact–stage  Organisational   Involvement  involved from   Controversy–stage  Company Z:   involved from   Gap–stage        FIGURE 3. An integrated managerial framework.  framework, (2) the organisational aspects, and (3) the  managerial aspects, in particular the allocation of  managerial responsibilities. The previous three sec-  tions suggest the framework shown in Fig. 3. This  framework measures the extent of managerial  involvement along the horizontal axis and the extent  of organisation-wide involvement along the vertical  axis. The three stages of strategic issues can be pos-  itioned along the diagonal: the Impact-stage is in the  lower left-hand box and the Gap-stage in the upper  right-hand box.  To illustrate the framework, we put two of our case  study companies into the framework: companies X  and Z. Company X uses a Corporate-level approach  with a low level of managerial involvement and  mainly reacts to strategic issues when the issues have  reached the Impact-stage. In contrast, company Z uses  a Process-Oriented approach with a high level of  managerial involvement enabling the company to  choose to become involved from the Gap-stage. This  is not the case with company X: this company is con-  fronted with strategic issues at the Impact-stage and  has no choice but to implement reactive strategies.  Company Z, however, can make strategic choices  Strategic Issue Management in Major European-Based Companies  regarding the stage at which the company becomes  involved in managing strategic issues. In the next  section, we will illustrate the framework by dis-  cussing different strategies for dealing with strategic  issues.  Proactive vs Reactive Attitudes  The position of a company in the matrix of the frame-  work corresponds with a specific way of identifying,  managing, and organising for strategic issues, and it  also indicates the use of proactive or reactive stra-  tegies in its response to issues. Company X, for exam-  ple, has a predominantly reactive attitude towards  external stakeholders. The level of organisational and  managerial involvement in strategic issues is low.  Only corporate staff members are working on Issue  Management. Although these staff members can  anticipate and identify issues at an early stage, most  issues still will only be acted on when the issue has  an actual impact on a business unit or an operational  company. The line managers will then become Issue  Owners for the issue in the Impact-stage and they will  55  have to act fast to implement a (reactive) strategy. The  Issue Guardian in the staff department will help by  passing on information and other material.  Strategic Choice  While company X waits to react until an issue is in  the late Controversy or Impact-stage before a strategy  is implemented, company Z has a strategic choice  between a proactive or reactive strategy because of its  early managerial involvement in issues. In company  Z (senior) line managers at corporate, business and  operating unit levels are involved in Issue Manage-  ment. Even more: they are assigned as Issue Owners  of important strategic issues. So they have the  responsibility for dealing with them in the best poss-  ible way. Because the line managers are involved from  the Gap-stage of an issue, they can make a choice  between being proactive now (e.g., anticipating and  acting before something has happened, taking the  initiative by changing policies, releasing information,  or cooperating with stakeholders) or doing nothing  and waiting, and implementing a reactive strategy if  something happens, defending and adjusting if  necessary. Considering all the complex and inter-  acting factors, the line management can decide what  to do, depending on the nature of the issue, its esti-  mated impact and probability of occurrence, whether  the issue touches on core activities or entails com-  petitive advantages, top management’s preferences  and attitudes, the company’s culture and dominant  logic, etc. In company X on the other hand, where  line managers become involved with strategic issues  Proactive attitude  Reactive attitude  Proactive   strategy  Reactive   strategy  Reactive   strategy  Issue Management   Stakeholder management   Crisis Management     Crisis Management     Strategic choice  FIGURE 4. Management attitudes and strategic options.  Long Range Planning Vol. 32 January 1999  only as they occur, they do not have this choice (see  Fig. 4).  Obviously, companies X and Z are at the extreme  ends of the spectrum and combinations or inter-  mediate forms are possible. Sometimes staff members  at corporate levels do act proactively on important  strategic issues, formulating policy guidelines that,  after approval by the Board of Directors, must be  implemented by the line managers in their business  units as company policy.  Company Z is supposedly more proactive towards  its environment. The line managers are involved in  Issue Management at all stages, and they have to be  sensitive to signals, developments, and trends in the  company’s environment. They must pay more atten-  tion to the outside world and adopt a more open atti-  tude towards various stakeholders in society,  listening to their ideas, expectations and demands,  and taking this information into account in their  decision-making, so the company’s ability to respond  will be enhanced. Their actions may help their com-  pany to reduce or even avoid negative publicity and  financial damage.  Management teams with these proactive attitudes  might be quick to recognise that issues may represent  opportunities and they may adopt proactive stra-  tegies, working interactively with stakeholder groups.  In ‘interactive strategies’, stakeholders are sometimes  involved in the decision-making process, looking for  mutually acceptable solutions and compromises  between the interests of different groups. Harrison &  St. John23 use the term ‘stakeholder partnering’. Issue  56  Management and Stakeholder Management are  related concepts, because for every issue, a stake-  holder analysis is required to determine who the most  important stakeholders are for a particular issue, and  to estimate their influence.  Obviously, the implementation of effective Issue  Management cannot guarantee that a company will  never experience a crisis situation. So it is important  for companies to develop crisis awareness and Crisis  Management capabilities, too. However, sound Issue  Management should reduce the number of occasions  when Crisis Management is needed.

This article used two ways to expand  the knowledge about how to accomplish that. First,  based on case study research in large European-based  multinational firms, we proposed a conceptual mana-  gerial framework which advocates different forms of  organisational involvement and different ways of  allocating managerial responsibilities. Second, illus-  trating the framework with case study evidence, we  explained how different ways of organising and man-  aging strategic issues can limit or facilitate man-  agement’s strategic choices and produce a proactive  or reactive strategy. As multinational companies need  to become more responsive to strategic issues, we  suggest companies should move from a reactive to a  proactive mode in which the companies’ line man-  agers are involved at an early stage, creating a strategic  choice for action.  57  18.

As we will argue this  his perspective and the associated references, analy-  sis and results are really missing and, therefore, the  other paper about the telecom industry published in  this journal (Curwen, 2001). In their reply, the  authors of that paper emphasized that Dr. Curwen  three issues as well.  doi:10.1016/j.emj.2004.09.017  European Management Journal Vol. 22, No. 5, pp. 600–604, 2004    2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.  Printed in Great Britain  0263-2373 $30.00paper provides no new insights.  We believe the rejoinder primarily belongs to this  third category. Without explicitly emphasizing his  perspective, Dr. Curwen seems to take a descriptive  approach and uses the industry as the main level of  analysis. Our paper uses theoretical frameworks  aimed at explanation and focuses on a firm level of  analysis. Our paper’s aim is, therefore, not to provide  a rich description but to use theory-driven frameworks  aimed at explaining firm behavior. Dr. Curwen, how-  ever, does not say a single word about our theoretical  framework but starts immediately ridiculing our re-  search question and findings. In doing so, he does  not provide empirical evidence regarding our re-  search question or theoretical arguments to support  his view, apart from a reference to those who are:  ‘fully conversant with the telecommunications  We will first elaborate on the obvious point that using  different perspectives produces different results. Sec-  ond, we will reflect on the main issues raised in the  rejoinder. Finally, we will conclude by emphasizing  that industry experts, as Dr. Curwen claims to be,  do not possess any kind of monopoly on understand-  ing ‘their’ industry. On the contrary, we and many  other scholars believe that the scientific understand-  ing of phenomena like the strategic renewal of estab-  lished firms make real progress by both respecting  other scientific approaches and by trying to reconcile  the insights gained. In doing so, they may really help  managers, employees, and other stakeholders.  Misreading the Paperis not so in the case of our paper. Second, the paper’s  message is not clearly communicated, which is al-  ways to some extent the case. Third, the author of  the rejoinder simply takes another perspective as op-  posed to the one used in the paper. Subsequently he  starts criticizing the paper from the point of view that  based his comments largely on (1) misreading their  paper (‘Misconception of the Purpose’), on (2) inap-  propriate analysis, and on (3) not providing an  empirical refutation of their paper ‘because he bases  his claims on weak evidence.’ (Jamison and Chan-  Olmsted, 2002:96). In our reply we will address theseStrategic Ren  Europe’s Lar  Operators (19  A Reply to C  FRANS A.J.

Addressing this issue, we use two complementary  theoretical lenses in our paper. The institutional theory  lens views strategic renewal as determined by insti-  tutional forces. In this connection, Scott (2001) distin-  guishes three institutional forces. First, regulative  systems in which rules, laws and sanctions regard-  ing, for example, liberalization, exert coercive power  in strategic renewal. Second, normative systems,  including both values and norms, impose constraints  on strategic renewal. Third, cultural-cognitive sys-  tems highlight shared conceptions and a common  frame of reference regarding e.g. the possibility of  strategic renewal. These three institutional forces eli-  cit three related bases of legitimacy for organizations.  To the extent that these institutional forces operate at  industry level, this theoretical lens predicts that the  strategic renewal trajectories of, in particular, large  established incumbents, will be relatively similar in  their endeavor to maintain their legitimacy. In con-  trast to a dominant focus of institutional theory on  an outside-in approach (Greenwood and Hinings,  e.g. the third paper in Table 1, to a firm level of any  analysis, e.g. the paper of Rodrigues and Child  (2003). They investigated a major Brazilian telecoms  firm (Telemig) in a detailed and longitudinal study.  These authors examine the extent to which co-evolu-  tion can take place in an institutionalized environ-  ment, taking into account the strategic choice of the  firm involved. The studies in Table 1 emphasize, as  in our paper, the necessity to use theories and theo-  retical frameworks to increase the understanding of  firm behavior.  Table 1 also shows that papers on organizational  change and renewal primarily focus on particular  ways of renewal i.e. by merging (Baroncelli, 1998)  or by entering alliances (Joshi et al., 1998). In our pa-  per, we aimed at a more encompassing approach of re-  newal by focusing on the context-, content-, and  process dimensions. In such an approach, strategic  renewal includes mergers and alliances, but is not  limited to these specific strategic actions. For that rea-  son, we designed a new research methodology  aimed at getting a richer picture of strategic renewal  Ind  our  our  our  Stu  STRATEGIC RENEWAL OF EUROPE’S LARGEST TELECOM OPERATORS (1992–2001)1996), a strategic choice perspective allows for incor-  porating an inside-out approach as well. This per-  spective tries to explain the conditions for firm  specific strategic renewal journeys (Flier et al., 2003;  Rodrigues and Child, 2003). In our paper these two  theoretical perspectives are illustrated in a concep-  tual framework depicting four idealized strategic re-  newal journeys (Volberda et al., 2001a).  Research, from a strategic management perspective,  into the telecoms industry and telecoms firms does  take place in the major journals in the field, albeit  not frequently. Table 1 provides some key examples.  These papers range from an industry level of analysis,  Table 1 Examples of Investigations into the Telecom  Strategy Field (1994–2003)  Author(s) (year) Journal  Kashlak and Joshi (1994) Strategic Management J  Smith and Zeithaml (1996) Organization Science  Genschel (1997) Organization Studies  Baroncelli (1998) Long Range Planning  Joshi et al.

As mentioned in our pa-  per, this research methodology is described else-  where, including issues like intercoder reliability  and the pro’s and con’s regarding other methods,  and the issue of weighting the strategic renewal ac-  tions (Volberda et al., 2001 b). Regarding the latter is-  sue, due to data limitations in cross-country  investigations, this was not possible.  Having briefly indicated the purpose, focus and re-  search approach of our paper, we will now reflect  on Dr. Curwen’s comments that are based on a mis-  reading of the paper. First, the scope of the paper is  criticized as unclear: is it the industry, incumbents,  ustry and Telecom Firms in Scientific Journals in the  Topic  nal Core business regulation and dual diversification  patterns of U.S. Regional Bell Operating Companies.

STRATEGIC RENEWAL OF EUROPE’S LARGEST TELECOM OPERATORS (1992–2001)alization. Unfortunately, we have no section on liber-  alization, but on three forces at industry level,  liberalization being one of these forces.  Third, Dr. Curwen criticizes our remark about the  economies of scale in mobile telephony and illus-  trates his argument by referring to developments  that took place after (!) our period of investigation  (1999–2001). In our remark, however, we only  pointed out in our paper that ‘A strong customer  base in the home country market is no longer suffi-  cient to offer mobile services cost-effectiveness.’ (p.  275). We do not argue – like Dr. Curwen suggests  we do – that operators are obliged to set up networks  abroad in order to achieve economies of scale. Creat-  ing economies of scale and scope are more encom-  passing than going abroad. Telecom incumbents  regularly discuss the various sources of economies  of scale and scope in their annual reports (see e.g.  BT’s Annual Report 2001). See also Balsinde et al.  (2000) for economies of scale in purchasing, IT and  overhead in the context of the telecom industry.  Fourth, the paper is criticized in terms of ‘the almost  complete absence of ‘‘politics’’, meaning that privati-  zation often takes place with the State retaining con-  trolling shares. This is another example of  misreading the paper. The use of institutional theory  deliberately takes into account regulation and the  normative institutional pressures associated with  governmental agencies. See also the next section in  which we emphasize it is not the purpose of the pa-  per to provide rich descriptions.  Fifth, Dr. Curwen (2004, rejoinder) suggested: ‘that  the database was chosen in such a way as to prede-  termine to a considerable degree the conclusion that  the five companies studied would behave in a similar  way.’ We simply do not understand this comment:  we have not chosen a database. In previous publica-  tions we introduced a research methodology to cap-  ture in an encompassing way the strategic renewal  phenomenon. The research methodology is, of  course, open for scientific discussion which is, by  the way, not the case in the opinions expressed by  Dr. Curwen such as: ‘After all, it does not take much  imagination to appreciate that incumbent telcos con-  trolled by the State will behave in a pretty similar  manner.’ (Curwen, 2004, rejoinder).  Analysis Based on Theoretical  Frameworks Versus Rich Descriptions  The majority of Dr. Curwen’s comments relate to crit-or new entrants? As the title of the paper already  highlights, and the exposition above made clear, we  focus on the largest telecoms firms and try to explain  their strategic renewal behavior at firm level. Second,icizing our paper for providing not enough details,  602 EuroThe Necessity of Taking Research  Questions Seriously  Our paper addresses a research question: To what  extent do the strategic renewal journeys of incum-  bents result from similar selection forces at industry  level or do these journeys result from strategic  choice? This question highlights a central problem  in the strategy field: Are firms driven by the environ-  ment or do firm idiosyncratic factors (like specific  competences) and actors (like management) also  matter? In a more encompassing co-evolutionary ap-  proach regarding this central problem, not per-  formed in our paper, firm behavior like strategic  renewal is explained as the joint outcome of manage-  rial intentionality, environmental and institutional  forces (Lewin and Volberda, 1999; Volberda and Le-  win, 2003). This central problem is relevant for all  industries, not only the telecom industry. See for  example Canals’ (1998) contribution in this journal  concerning the need for corporate renewal in the  banking industry. Indeed, contrary to rich descrip-  tion of a particular industry, scientific questions are  generic and are intended to explain phenomena be-  yond the specific boundaries of a particular industry.  If Dr. Curwen (2004, rejoinder) points out in a com-  ment that our paper ‘claims that the findings canproper names of technologies, timing of technologies,  partitioning these technologies in particular genera-  tions etc. These comments provide the opportunity  to highlight another difference in approach and,  therefore, also another example of misreading the pa-  per. Our paper does not aim at providing a rich con-  textual description of either the telecoms industry,  technological development or the incumbents. This  is well done by Curwen (2002) in his book on The Fu-  ture of Mobile Communication. He aims to investi-  gate ‘the prospects for mobile communications in  the new millennium’ by providing several mainly  descriptive chapters and a case study.  But rich description needs theoretical lenses to ex-  plain why things happen as they happen. And that  is exactly our purpose, as is more than clear in our  paper. So, if our paper contains about 30 sentences  to briefly indicate the technological forces we are  more than aware they do not do justice to a rich  description. One interesting comment is related to  the full name of GPRS: Dr. Curwen mentioned that  this refers to General Packet Radio Service while  we, like e.g. Barnett et al. (2000), used General Packet  Radio System. In this connection, we would like to  refer to Curwen (2002: XXII) pointing out: ‘there is  a surprising amount of discrepancy in the naming  of organizations/technologies’. Indeed, we are awarebe generalized to all regulated industries during  pean Management Journal Vol. 22, No. 5, pp. 600–604, October 2004  question he is simply of the opinion ‘that large  incumbents had similar trajectories’ of strategic re-  strategy in the global telecommunications market – A  rejoinder to Chan-Olmsted and Jamison. European  STRATEGIC RENEWAL OF EUROPE’S LARGEST TELECOM OPERATORS (1992–2001)newal. Although such an opinion is nice in personal  conversations, it lacks the prerequisites for scientific  discussions. In his rejoinder, Dr. Curwen does not re-  fer to strategic renewal trajectories and the key attri-  butes mentioned in our paper of the incumbents  investigated, nor to the theories used that underpin  the research question and analysis. What is more,  as a result of his rich description approach, his state-  ments about the question of similar trajectories seem  to contradict each other. Dr. Curwen points out, for  example: ‘. . . incumbents controlled by the State  (France Télécom and Deutsche Telekom) behaved  differently from the others . . . (because) . . . they be-  came the world’s most indebted telcos.’  Taking into account that the five incumbents entered  the period of investigation from a different position,  possessed different administrative heritages and  path dependencies, and operated in different na-  tional institutional environments and associated gov-  ernance structures, we think answering our research  question is not obvious and certainly not easy. We  suggested using key attributes of strategic renewal  journeys (see Table 4 in our paper) to empirically as-  sess to what extent the strategic renewal actions dif-  fer. Of course, this is a first step in a more  encompassing investigation of the research question.  Comments provided by Dr. Curwen regarding look-  ing more closely at technological developments, and  to the involvement of governments in incumbent  telecoms firms are, therefore, helpful suggestions  for future research.  Conclusion  In our reply we have addressed the main comments  by first briefly summarizing the research question,  theoretical background, research question, and re-  search methodology and, second, by showing that  Dr. Curwen’s comments result from a misreading  of our paper. This misreading, we argue, is due to  taking another approach contrary to what we have  chosen in our paper, without explicitly making  this clear in the rejoinder. Our paper’s aim is not tothe same period’ he is absolutely wrong. We do not  make such a claim, we only suggest that the research  question, the theory-driven frameworks and the in-  sights gained may be used for analyzing strategic re-  newal of incumbents in other industries as well.  Theories, research questions related to theories and  frameworks, and research methodologies can and  do, in principle, cross industry boundaries.  Is answering our research question obvious? Accord-  ing to Dr. Curwen’s rejoinder it is.

Dr. Curwen does not say a single word about theo-  ries but starts immediately ridiculing our research  question and findings. He does not provide empirical  evidence regarding the strategic renewal trajectories  of the incumbents. At least five times, Dr. Curwen  mentions or refers to ‘knowledge of the telecoms  industry’ as a prerequisite for doing research into  the telecoms industry. We suggest that using inter-  esting research questions, proper theory-driven  frameworks and research methodologies aimed at  explanation are even more important for ‘telecom-  munications practitioners/academics.’ (Curwen,  rejoinder). Finally, we believe that the scientific  understanding of complex organizational and mana-  gerial phenomena, like the strategic renewal of  incumbent firms, deserves contribution from various  scientific disciplines, including rich descriptions of  industries, to really make progress.

MARTEN STIENSTRA, Erasmus University, Rotterdam  MARC BAAIJ, Erasmus University, Rotterdam  FRANS VAN DEN BOSCH, Erasmus University, Rotterdam  HENK VOLBERDA, Erasmus University, Rotterdam  Forces of deregulation, internationalisation and  technological innovation have dramatically  changed the European telecommunications indus-  try. To cope with these forces, incumbent telecom-  munication operators had to strategically renew  their companies. What can be learned from these  incumbents and which managerial challenges are  ahead? To address these questions, we investigated  trajectories of strategic renewal of Europe’s five  largest incumbent operators and the impact on fin-  ancial performance for the period 1992–2001.  Remarkably, we did not find significant differences  between the renewal trajectories of these incum-  bents. These findings suggest herd behaviour, indi-  cating a preference for adopting similar organiza-  tional templates due to institutional forces resulting  in a common ‘follow the industry’ renewal tra-  jectory. In the years to come, however, we expect  such herd behaviour will not be viable anymore.  On the contrary, top management should make  firm-specific strategic choices.

Forces like liberalis-  ation, privatisation, internationalisation and  technological innovation have transformed the Euro-  pean telecommunications industry. In responding to  these forces, incumbent operators have had to engage  in strategic renewal. The telecommunications indus-  try is not a unique case. Deregulation, internationalis-  ation and innovation have transformed other regu-  lated industries in Europe as well. Examples of such  industries are financial services, airlines, and elec-  tricity and gas utilities.  In this exploratory study, we investigate how Euro-  pe’s five largest incumbent telecommunications oper-  ators2 have responded to the increase of turbulence  in their industry during the decade preceding the  telecom crash that started in 2001 (cf. The Economist,  2002). From a practitioners’ perspective, the research  is relevant as it examines how top management of  large incumbents tries to cope with the turbulence in  their industry.

However, the relevance of this study is  not limited to managers of the large telecommuni-  cations companies. The forces that have changed the  European telecommunications industry have also  influenced other regulated industries in Europe.  Therefore, the analysis and insights presented here  can also be used outside the telecommunications  industry. Managers in other industries may use this  framework as well to formulate strategic renewal tra-  jectories of their companies.  The focus of this paper is on incumbent telecom-  munications operators and not on new entrants. As  incumbent operators were used to stable competition  for a long time, they are probably most challenged  to strategically renew themselves; i.e. to perform stra-  tegic renewal actions to align organizational com-  petencies with the environment to increase competi-  tive advantage. Building upon previous research in  which a conceptual framework of strategic renewal  journeys was developed (Volberda et al., 2001a) and  has been applied to the European financial services  sector (Volberda et al., 2001b),  we focus here on the main attri-  butes of strategic renewal jour-  neys. These attributes indicate  to what extent strategic renewal  actions are externally versus  internally oriented;  international versus domestic;  exploration- versus exploi-  tation-oriented, and aim at expansion versus retreat.  We assess for each of the European top five operators  how external, international, explorative, and expans-  ive its strategic renewal actions have been. We are in  particular interested to learn how different the pat-  terns of strategic renewal actions, i.e. the resulting  strategic renewal journeys, of the top five have been.  In addressing this issue, we focus on the question:  To what extent the renewal journeys of incumbents  do result from similar selection forces at industry  level or do these journeys result from strategic  choice? Strong forces at industry level might suggest  similarities and herd behaviour (‘following the  industry’), whereas distinct strategic choices at firm  level would promote differences in strategic renewal  journeys. Finally, we analyse the financial perform-  ance (return on equity) of the operators to highlight  the relationship between strategic renewal and per-  formance.  This paper is organised into four sections. In the first,  we analyse the main forces transforming the European  telecommunications industry during the past decade.  In the second section, we discuss two opposing per-  spectives on strategic renewal, i.e. an institutional and  a strategic choice perspective. Next, we describe  briefly our methodology and present our empirical  findings. In the final section, we draw conclusions and  discuss the implications for management.  European Management Journal Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 273–280, June 2004274  Three Forces at Industry Level  For decades the European telecommunications indus-  try can be characterized as rather stable. Protected by  State regulations, the incumbent (State-owned) oper-  ators enjoyed the benefits of monopoly. In the last  decade, however, the European telecommunications  industry has changed from a closed and stable indus-  try into a more open and dynamic one. We focus here  on three interacting forces at industry level that are  responsible for this development: (1) institutional  forces (privatisation and liberalisation), (2) inter-  nationalisation forces and (3) technological forces.  The liberalisation of the European telecommunications  industry was triggered by the formation of the Euro-  pean Union (EU) in 1992. While the United Kingdom  was already liberalised in 1984, large EU countries  such as Italy, France, Germany and Spain followed  in the mid-nineties (see Table 1). Liberalisation  implied that the former monopolies of the incumbent  operators were broken down. The former monopol-  ists faced two types of new competition. First, the  incumbents had to open up  their wireline network to com-  petitive carriers, such as Tele2.  The incumbents still own and  operate the phone lines but  they have to provide access to  new entrants. Second, the wire-  line incumbents faced the entry  of wireless communications  operators, such as Vodafone. The liberalisation of the  European telecommunications industry introduced  competition, choice for customers, lower prices and  improved quality of services (Information Society,  1997). In advance of national announcements of  deregulation and liberalisation, State-owned oper-  ators were fully or partly privatised in order to better  exploit new market opportunities (see Table 1).  Wireline, or fixed-line, voice calls used to be the  mainstream business of incumbent operators for a  long time. However, due to technological forces this  traditional wireline business has come under attack  by the development of wireless or mobile communi-  cations. Mobile communication started in 1992 with  the first generation standard GSM (Global System for  Mobile Communication). This standard was  extended in 2000 with the second generation stan-  dard GPRS (General Packet Radio System). Sub-  sequent generations of mobile communication allow  for higher capacity networks to download and pro-  cess information at higher speed. Wireless voice com-  munications have become a substitute for wireline  voice calls. Wireless has grown from 9 per cent of  worldwide revenues in 1993 to 48 per cent today. The  number of wireless users worldwide has now sur-  passed the number of fixed lines3.  Another important technology is the Internet.

Whereas wireless communications, as a substi-  tute for wireline, caused a decline in wireline com-  munications, the Internet caused an increase in the  wireline traffic volumes. In Europe, revenues from  Internet traffic showed a compound annual growth  rate of about 100 per cent (The Economist, 2002) as  more and more companies and consumers got access  to the Internet. Internet, however, is not restricted to  data and video traffic. Internet may also be used to  handle voice traffic: Internet telephony. This Internet-  based voice calling is a substitute for traditional voice  calling. These technological forces triggered the stra-  tegic renewal efforts of the incumbents.  Internationalisation forces created new international  market opportunities. An example of these opport-  unities are the economies of scale in mobile com-  munications. A strong customer base in the home  market is no longer sufficient to offer mobile services  cost-effectiveness. The opening of national markets  confronted incumbents with an increasing number of  new entrants in their domestic markets. Examples of  new entrants in the European telecommunications  industry are Vodafone and Orange, which entered  the European national home markets quickly to  destroy the stranglehold of incumbent operators in  leadership positions. These developments are sup-  ported by regulations that allow new entrants to con-  nect their networks to those of current market players  (Information Society, 1997). As new entrants created  an increasing number of alternatives in the market,  incumbents were confronted with more demanding  customers forcing them to renew.  Strategic Renewal: Driven by Industry  Forces and/or by Strategic Choice?  Confronted with these industry forces, incumbent  operators had to engage in strategic renewal. Accord-  ing to Volberda et al. (2001a), a firm’s strategic  renewal journey is reflected by the strategic actions  a firm undertakes to alter its path dependence. These  strategic actions are driven by both external selection  forces at industry level, i.e. management is passive  regarding the environment, and internal forces, i.e.  European Management Journal Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 273–280, June 2004 275  management is active regarding the environment. By  making a conceptual distinction between an active  and a passive attitude towards the environment of  top management and of middle- and frontline man-  agement, four idealised renewal journeys of multi-  unit firms can be discerned (see Figure 1). The upper-  left box illustrates the situation in which manage-  ment is essentially passive regarding the environ-  ment, i.e. forces at industry level. In such a context  the strategic renewal journeys are driven by common  outside forces. We label such renewal journeys as  ‘emergent renewal’ in which the ‘market decides’  about proper strategic renewal actions resulting in  firms following the rules of the industry.  In the period investigated, large incumbents were  confronted with strong interacting forces at industry  level influencing the international character of the  level playing field, and the institutional and techno-  logical context in which the incumbents have to  renew. Seen in this context, using an institutional  theory lens to investigate strategic renewal journeys of  incumbents is helpful for our purpose. Institutional  theory views strategic renewal as restricted by an  inevitable push towards increasing homogeneity of  in particular incumbent firms in their industry.  According to the institutional perspective, strategic  renewal can only be achieved through maintaining  congruence with shifting industry norms regarding  e.g. internationalisation and technologies and shared  management logics (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983;  Greenwood and Hinings, 1996). The institutional per-  Figure 1 Four Emergent Renewal Journeys Towards  Directed and Transformational Renewal  TELECOMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY  spective corresponds with emergent strategic  renewal journeys, in which top-, middle- and front-  line management are passive regarding the environ-  ment (see Figure 1). As Volberda et al. (2001a, p. 162)  pointed out: ‘The ideal emergent journey of renewal  is rooted in the assumption that managers believe  that they be should essentially outwardly oriented or  passive, their role being to amplify market forces and  market signals … ‘. DiMaggio and Powell (1983) con-  sider such mimetic behaviour as the modelling of an  organisation after similar organisations in the same  field that they perceive to be successful and legit-  imate. In emergent strategic renewal journeys, firms  imitate practices (‘following the industry’) from other  successful organisations that are considered as being  legitimate in the hope of getting similar rewards. As  the top five telecommunications operators were con-  fronted with strong institutional forces, especially in  the first half of the 1990s, the institutional perspective  on strategic renewal suggests, therefore, that incum-  bent operators will display industry-generic behav-  iour, resulting in similar renewal trajectories over time  (see Table 2).  In contrast to institutional theories, Baden-Fuller and  Stopford (1994) argue that managerial intentionality  is the most important driving force of renewal, not  the industry. Their view corresponds with the stra-  tegic choice perspective. Strategic choice theory views  strategic renewal as a dynamic interaction process  between organisations and their environment (Child,  1997; Miles and Snow, 1978; Hrebiniak and Joyce,  1985), attributing the top management team mana-  gerial leeway regarding their environment and  organisational design. The strategic choice perspec-  tive fits with the concept of the directed and the  transformational renewal journey (see Figure 1 and  Table 2). In both the directed and the transform-  ational journey, top management is active with  respect to the environment and believe they can  influence the environment and change their own des-  tiny. As strategic choice in general, and directed and  transformational renewal in particular, are associated  with new ways of thinking, unlearning and entrepr-  eneurial spirit, a higher level of risk is involved.  The strategic choice perspective on strategic renewal  suggests that incumbent operators focus on com-  pany-specific behaviour, resulting in idiosyncratic  renewal trajectories over time (see Table 2).

Each operator entered the new land-  scape from a different position. Different  administrative heritages and path dependencies may  have influenced strategic choices. Furthermore, the  decision makers of these incumbent operators may  have diverging ambition levels and views on the  future of the industry (‘industry foresight’), which  also impact the strategic choices.  Empirical Research into the Strategic  Renewal Journeys  Empirical data on the five largest European incum-  bent operators will be used to analyse the journeys  of strategic renewal. If these data reveal highly similar  renewal trajectories over time, this indicates strong  institutional forces at industry level resulting in herd  behaviour. If the data about the incumbent operators  reveal significantly different renewal journeys, how-  ever, this indicates strategic renewal is more driven  by strategic choice than by industry forces.  We use a document analysis to uncover and analyse  journeys of strategic renewal4. First, we created a  database of strategic renewal actions of the incum-  bents for the 1992–2001 period. Strategic renewal  actions are extracted from publicly available second-  ary data sources (annual reports and an extensive  electronic database of Financial Times articles). The  combined use of these two data sources allow for  both an insider perspective (annual report) and an  outsider perspective (Financial Times) to access the  strategic actions that have been implemented. We  define strategic renewal action as: actions taken by the  organisation, which are likely to have an impact on  the overall behaviour of the organization and its per-  formance. Such actions typically include mergers and  acquisitions, joint ventures, alliances, new business  ventures, acquisition of (mobile) licenses and sale or  closure of businesses and activities (Volberda et al.,  2001a).  In order to uncover patterns of renewal, all strategic  renewal actions undertaken by the incumbent oper-  ators in the 1992–2001 period were coded using four  TELECOMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY  T  a  b  le  3  T  h  e  F  o  u  r  A  tt  ri  b  u  te  s  o  f  S  tr  a  te  g  ic  R  e  n  e  w  a  l  A  c  ti  o  n  s  a  n  d  C  o  rr  e  sp  o  n  d  in  g  R  a  ti  o  s  1.

These four cat-  egories of strategic renewal cover both context (the  first two lines in Table 3) and content (the latter two  lines in Table 3) dimensions of strategy (Mintzberg,  1990). For each of these four categories we use met-  rics to capture meaningful development. For  example, by relating a firm’s external actions to the  sum of all its strategic renewal actions (both external  and internal actions) during a period, we created a  ratio, coined here ‘ external orientation ratio’ (see  Table 3). The maximum value of these ratios is 1, the  minimum equals zero.  Empirical Findings  Table 4 shows the ratios corresponding with the four  categories of strategic renewal, measured over the  1992 – 2001 period. Using ratios enables the compari-  son of strategic renewal processes over time, both  within and between companies. In order to deter-  mine whether the incumbent firms reveal herd  behaviour or not, we used the P-values of the t-tests  to determine whether the differences regarding the  four categories of strategic renewal action and the  financial performance (i.e. ROI) of the five operators  are significant or not (level of significance: 5 per cent).  If not, this indicates herd behaviour among the oper-  ators.  From Table 4 it appears that the top five incumbent  telecommunications operators do not show signifi-  cant differences with respect to three of the four  ratios capturing various aspects of their strategic  renewal journeys. The ratios regarding external  orientation, the exploration orientation and the  expansion orientation do not display significant dif-  ferences (P   0.05). To illustrate these findings for  the first two categories, Figure 2 shows how the five  incumbent operators herd together with respect to  the external orientation ratio and the exploration  orientation ratio. Similar values of the exploration  orientation ratio hint at a collective race of investing  in new technologies and the required licences. Con-  cerning the attribute of international orientation,  however, we have found significant differences  among the operators. Taking a closer look at the  international orientation ratio, however, we find that  the significance of the differences can be fully  explained by one telecom operator: Telecom Italia.  This company showed outlier behaviour in the sense  that only one-third of the strategic renewal actions  were internationally oriented, while for the other  companies about two-thirds were internationally ori-  ented.

Our analysis reveals no sig-  nificant differences regarding the return on equity of  the five companies (P   0.05).  Discussion  The lack of significant differences in the investigated  strategic renewal actions suggests the incumbent  firms copied to a large extent each others strategic  renewal actions as predicted by the institutional per-  spective on strategic renewal. These outcomes corre-  spond with the descriptions of the emergent strategic  renewal journey: ‘the market decides’ and ‘let’s fol-  low the industry’. Such renewal behaviour is not  restricted to large incumbents in the European tele-  communications industry. Previous research on stra-  tegic renewal in the European financial services  industry (Volberda et al., 2001a) — a comparable  industry regarding the industry forces investigated  here — revealed similar behaviour.  We should not conclude, however, that the five larg-  est telecommunications operators did not make dif-  ferent strategic choices at all during the period of  investigation. Even in situations of high environmen-  tal determinism due to the strong industry forces dis-  cussed above, there is potential for strategic choice  (Hrebiniak and Joyce, 1985). Although the strategic  TELECOMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY  renewal journeys of the five incumbent operators  look alike (see Table 4), they are not identical. There  are differences between the operators but these dif-  ferences were not found to be statistically significant.  Furthermore, even if the ratios reported in Table 4  are similar, operators may choose from multiple  alternative options within a particular category of  strategic renewal. For example, if an operator has  undertaken an internal action, the alternatives  include, among other things, start ups, greenfield  investments, and the launch of a new line of services.  What will be the next challenge for large incumbents  in the coming years? In the past years (see Figure  2), operators followed the general industry recipe of  investing in expensive third-generation licenses, ther-  eby burdening themselves with enormous debt5 To  reduce these debts the incumbent operators have to  restructure. They have to take impairment charges  for the devaluated licenses and acquired businesses.  Financial restructuring, including capital changes  and divestments, are required to reduce debt. Fur-  thermore, the incumbents need to reduce cost, among  other things, by means of lay-offs. In terms of the  strategic renewal actions such a development sug-  gests an increasing emphasis on exploitation and  retreat at the expense of exploration and expansion.  All incumbents will face the same restructuring  pressures and similar strategic actions are likely. The  opportunities for idiosyncratic strategic renewal  behaviour, indeed for strategic choice, are expected  to increase when the incumbents have resolved the  debt and performance issues.  Unfortunately, this study is not without its limi-  tations. First, the analysis was limited to the dichot-  omous level of the four categories of strategic  renewal. Second, this study did not distinguish  between the different segments that compose the  telecommunication industry. For example, we con-  ducted no separate analyses of mobile and fixed line  telecommunication segments. Third, this study was  restricted to the five largest incumbent telecommuni-  cation operators. Other countries and smaller incum-  bents and new entrants as well were excluded from  the analysis.  Conclusion  In the last decade, European incumbent telecom-  munications operators have been confronted with  several forces that have transformed their industry  and that have triggered their strategic renewal  actions. Our research of the European top five incum-  bent telecommunications operators reveals no sig-  nificant differences regarding four categories of stra-  tegic renewal actions. This suggests, due to selection  forces and in particular the institutional context,  these firms collectively choose an emergent strategic  renewal journey (‘follow the industry’).  European Management Journal Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 273–280, June 2004 279  However, while the importance of the institutional  forces are diminishing nowadays, managers may  benefit from more strategic freedom to seize opport-  unities. As the largest operators previously found  themselves confronted in ‘the same box’ of emergent  renewal (see Figure 1), it is now time for strategic  choice and ‘out of the emergent renewal box’ think-  ing. Both directed and transformational renewal (see  Figure 1) seem viable options for incumbent oper-  ators to recover from the telecom crash. These stra-  tegic renewal journeys require a fundamental change  of (top) management’s attitude towards the environ-  ment: from passive (‘let’s follow the industry’)  towards an active attitude (‘changing the industry  rules’).  The patterns of emergent renewal and herd behav-  iour are not necessarily restricted to large firms in the  European telecommunications industry. Other Euro-  pean industries that were confronted with similar  forces may display similar results, as previous  research has already revealed for the European fin-  ancial services industry (Volberda et al., 2001a).  Our framework identifies whether companies’ stra-  tegic renewal trajectories differ (significantly) from  each other or not. To escape herd-behaviour, it  becomes necessary for management to craft one’s  own idiosyncratic trajectory of strategic renewal. This  is a challenge for management and in particular for  top management, but will enable gaining a sus-  tainable competitive advantage. This paper contrib-  utes to this objective by offering managers a frame-  work to analyse their strategic renewal efforts.  Notes  1.

Leveraging existing competencies, however, requires refinement, efficiency, and  207J.H. Burgers et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 24 (2009) 206–220improvement, which succeeds by reducing variance, increasing control, and integrating the venture and the parent firm  (Benner and Tushman, 2003; March, 1991). Integration refers to “the process of achieving unity of effort among various  subsystems in the accomplishment of the organization's tasks” (Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967: 4), and reflects specific  mechanisms through which organizational units are coordinated and facilitated to work together.  Previous studies on venturing have tended to focus on the organizational structure as the appropriateway bywhich organizations  may either facilitate differentiation or integration (Heller, 1999). Lawrence and Lorsch (1967), however, viewed differentiation and  integration as complementary instead of a trade-off. In addition, ambidextrous approaches (Tushman and O'Reilly, 1996) have  suggested that loose-tight coupled designs create permeability across differentiated units and enable organizations to establish  strategic coherence through integrative linkages (Orton andWeick, 1990;Westerman et al., 2006). Ambidexterity and organizational  learning literatures pointed to several mechanisms thatmay achieve integration in more informal ways, such as establishing a shared  organizational vision or inducing topmanagement team social integration (Tsai andGhoshal,1998;O'Reilly and Tushman, 2004). Such  approaches allow for solving theparadoxbydeveloping specific configurations of differentiation and integrationmechanisms. There is,  however, little systematic evidence about the differential effects of configurations of structural differentiation and integration  mechanisms, in particular in the context of corporate venturing.  Byaddressing this research gap, our studycontributes toprior literatures in at least threeways. First, our studynotonly examines  the logic that structural differentiation facilitates corporate venturing, but also explores how structural differentiation combined  with certain integration mechanisms contributes to corporate venturing. Previous studies have largely ignored the importance of  establishing autonomous yet integrated designs to facilitate corporate venturing (Westerman et al., 2006) by focusing either on  differentiation (Burgelman, 1985; Fast, 1979) or integration mechanisms (Chesbrough, 2000; Thornhill and Amit, 2001). Based on  the ideas of Lawrence and Lorsch (1967), we argue that organizations need to establish both structural differentiation and  integration to address multiple conflicting demands. By exploring these contingencies, we provide new insights into howacross differentiated organizational units. We argue that because of the limited interdependency between venturing and  mainstream units, integration mechanisms may have differential effects on corporate venturing. We suggest that integration  mechanisms facilitating the establishment of tight-loose linkages across structurally differentiated venturing and mainstream  units will likely enhance a firm's corporate venturing activities.  Based on survey research on 240 Dutch companies, our findings support our contention that structural differentiation has a  positive effect on corporate venturing. However, we find that this direct effect is contingent upon specific organizational and top  management team integration mechanisms. Formal cross-functional interfaces, for instance, are conducive to transferring existing  knowledge sources, but we show that they negatively moderate the relationship between structural differentiation and corporate  venturing. Because the need for existing knowledge to venturing activities is likely to be rather limited, corporate ventures incur  these costly and complex integrative mechanisms without reaping their benefits. Our study also indicates that organizations  combining structural differentiation with a shared organizational vision are able to increase their corporate venturing activities.  Such informal organizational integration across structurally differentiated venturing and mainstream units promotes strategic  coherence and knowledge exchange through shared values and a common language. Regarding topmanagement team integration,  we find no evidence that TMT group contingency rewards enable venturing across differentiated units. Our findings do show,  however, that top management team social integration has a significantly negative moderating effect on the relationship between  structural differentiation and corporate venturing. This indicates that socially integrated top management teams may suffer from  groupthink, which does not allow for the deviating and autonomous behaviors of differentiated ventures.  The implications of our findings are that structural differentiation should be combined with particular integration mechanisms  when trying to enhance corporate venturing activities. The mix of differentiation and integration mechanisms should be carefully  chosen, as failing to do so can have detrimental effects on corporate venturing activities in established firms.  2. Introduction  Research has increasingly acknowledged that corporate venturing facilitates strategic renewal and increases organizational  growth and performance (Burgelman, 1983; Zahra and Covin, 1995). Corporate venturing refers to the creation of new  businesses within existing firms (Sharma and Chrisman, 1999), and involves the creation of new competencies and capabilities  underlying new products and services (Block and MacMillan, 1993; Zahra et al., 1999). Despite these beneficial outcomes,  scholars have argued that it is very complex and difficult to successfully manage venturing activities in incumbent firms  (Burgelman and Valikangas, 2005; Hill and Birkinshaw, 2008). Venturing creates paradoxical challenges within organizations,  as the explorative processes underlying venturing are at odds with ongoing business operations. However, corporate ventures  may also benefit from leveraging knowledge and resources available within mainstream businesses (Covin and Miles, 2007).  Although prior research has started to uncover appropriate contexts for venturing through differentiation or integration, our  understanding of how organizations may reconcile this paradox to effectively pursue corporate venturing is far from complete.  Exploratory processes in corporate venturing result from search, variation, and experimentation and have been associated with  autonomyand structural differentiation, i.e. “the segmentationof the organizational system into subsystems” (Lawrence and Lorsch,1967:  3–4). The latter serves as a mechanism for decoupling new venturing activities from mainstream businesses to enhance  flexibility and local adaptation in venturing units. Studies addressed the importance of structural differentiation in terms of New  VentureDivisions (Fast,1979), skunkworks (Peters andWaterman,1982) or independentbusinessunits (O'ReillyandTushman, 2004)  208 J.H. Burgers et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 24 (2009) 206–220organizations may establish structurally differentiated yet integrated designs capable of enhancing venturing activities within  established businesses.  Second, we simultaneously consider the effectiveness of various integration mechanisms in establishing loose-tight  coupling to enable corporate venturing. Whereas some scholars have focused on the role of corporate management  (Burgelman, 1985; O'Reilly and Tushman, 2004), others have pointed to organizational integration mechanisms (Brown and  Eisenhardt, 1997) to increase corporate venturing in differentiated units. Others have differentiated between formal and  informal mechanisms in coordinating and integrating business activities (Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000; Tsai, 2002). To  deepen our understanding of how organizations may successfully manage interdependencies across differentiated  venturing and mainstream units, several authors pled for a simultaneous assessment of multiple integration mechanisms  (Collins and Smith, 2006; Westerman et al., 2006). As such, we classify four types of integration mechanisms along two  aspects: (1) organizational and top management team, and (2) formal and informal integration mechanisms. We examine  the moderating effects of organizational-level (i.e. formally through cross-functional interfaces and informally through a  shared vision) and TMT-level (formally through group contingency rewards and informally through social integration)  integration mechanisms on the relationship between structural differentiation and corporate venturing.  Third, although integration mechanisms establish interactions across mainstream units (Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000), we  suggest that certain combinations of differentiation and integration mechanisms may lead to rigid and detrimental conditions for  corporate venturing. Although prior studies have highlighted the benefits of integration mechanisms for establishing cooperation  and interaction across highly interdependent units, we assert that integration mechanisms could also have negative outcomes for  more independent units such as corporate ventures. In this sense, we deliver new insights concerning the establishment of a  proper organizational context that is conducive to host differentiated yet partly integrated venturing and mainstream units  (e.g. Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004; Tushman and O'Reilly, 1996).  The paper proceeds as follows. The next section contains the literature review and hypotheses. Next we discuss the research  methodology and generation as well as validation of our measures, followed by our empirical findings. We conclude with a  discussion of our findings, implications for both scholars and practitioners, and future research issues.  3. Literature review and hypotheses  Studies on venturing have emphasized that corporate ventures are different from mainstream businesses (Burgelman, 1983;  Sykes and Block, 1989). Prior research has therefore argued that venturing activities should be differentiated in autonomous units  (Block and MacMillan, 1993; Burgelman, 1985; Fast, 1979) that allows for managing and rewarding ventures and mainstream  businesses in different ways (Kanter, 1985). Besides pointing out the differences between venturing and ongoing business  activities, scholars have also addressed the importance of available resources and complementary knowledge sources within firms  (Chesbrough, 2000; Dushnitsky and Lenox, 2006; Shrader and Simon, 1997; Thornhill and Amit, 2001). Van de Ven (1986) argued  that overcoming these paradoxical demands is central to the management of innovations, and suggested that managing part-  whole relationships across differentiated units is essential for innovation and venturing. Corporate venturing does “not occur in  abstraction from current abilities” (Kogut and Zander, 1992: 391) and involves both reusing existing knowledge and exploring new  knowledge (Covin andMiles, 2007;Hill and Birkinshaw, 2008; Katila andAhuja, 2002). Structurally differentiating venturing activities  in autonomous units may inhibit venture-parent organizational learning (Birkinshaw et al., 2002; Scarbrough et al., 2004) and  decrease synergies among units (Tushman and O'Reilly, 1996).  The combination of structural differentiation and integration creates a loosely coupled system, in which structural differentiation  facilitates local adaptability and exploration of novel businesses, and integrative mechanisms facilitate strategic coherence and  knowledge transfer between structurally differentiatedorganizational units (Gilbert, 2006;O'Reilly and Tushman, 2004;Weick,1982).  In this sense, integration mechanisms contribute to the effectiveness of structural differentiation in facilitating venturing and  innovation. Structurally differentiated corporate ventures, however, are relatively independent of other organizational units with a  limited need for knowledge exchange and combination (Burgelman,1985; Tushman and Nadler, 1978). We argue therefore that only  specific combinations of structural differentiation and integration contribute to the pursuit of corporate venturing in established  organizations.  3.1. Structural differentiation and corporate venturing  Structural differentiation refers to “differences among subunitswith respect to goal orientation, timeorientation, and interpersonal  orientation” (Golden and Ma, 2003: 485). It creates “pragmatic boundaries” (Carlile, 2004) that safeguard venturing activities from  dominantmanagerial cognitions and inertia present in the parent'smainstreamactivities (Benner and Tushman, 2003; Gilbert, 2005).  Structural differentiation provides ventures with a sense of freedom and ownership over their activities. Such spatial separation leads  to higher creativity (Amabile et al., 1996) and allows for adaptation to local demands. It facilitates within-venture learning and  increases knowledge creation at different venturing locations within organizations (Fiol, 1995; Scarbrough et al., 2004). Establishing  local ‘thought-worlds’ through differentiation leads to creative breakthroughs and more opportunities to venture (Fiol, 1995).  Furthermore, it keeps ventures away from reporting and annual budgeting policies (Burgelman, 1985), and protects them from  perverse pressures to grow fast (Burgelman and Valikangas, 2005). Moreover, through structural differentiation, venturing units can  adopt workingmethods that are better suited for their exploratory processes. Therefore, we argue that structural differentiation has a  positive effect on corporate venturing.  Hypothesis 1. Structural differentiation will be positively related to corporate venturing.  3.2. The moderating role of integration mechanisms  Prior literature has distinguished between formal and informal integration mechanisms, and have shown that both types o  mechanisms differentially impact important organizational outcomes such as knowledge sharing, exploration, and venturing  (Tsai, 2002; Jansen et al., 2006). Zahra and George (2002: 194), for instance, argued that “informal mechanisms are useful in  exchanging ideas, but formalmechanisms have the advantage of beingmore systematic.” In this sense, formal integrationmechanisms  provide less flexibility in knowledge exchange and are mostly associated with exploitative learning outcomes, while informa  mechanisms lead to more explorative learning (Daft and Lengel, 1986; Zahra and George, 2002). Scholars have argued that ventures  involve both exploitative and explorative learning (Hill and Birkinshaw, 2008), suggesting that ventures could potentially benefit from  both formal and informal integration. Therefore, we take both formal and informal integration mechanisms into account.  Scholars have also pointed at the distinct role of organizational and TMT integration mechanisms. Organizational integration  mechanisms have primarily been linked to knowledge transfer (cf. Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000; Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998)  whereas top management team integration has been associated with achieving strategic coherence and facilitating the allocation  and combination of resources (O'Reilly and Tushman, 2004). Given the importance of both transferring knowledge as well as  achieving synergies, we take into account both organizational and TMT integration mechanisms. Therefore, we classify four types  of integration mechanisms along two aspects: (1) formal and informal, and (2) organizational and TMT integration mechanisms  (see Fig. 1).  Following Galbraith (1973), Gupta and Govindarajan (2000) argued that cross-functional interfaces are formal organizationa  integration mechanisms that generate horizontal linkages between units. Cross-functional interfaces provide formal channels o  communication and information processing mechanisms and have been associated with cross-functional teams, task forces, and  liaison positions (Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000). In addition to more formal organizational integration (i.e. cross-functiona  209J.H. Burgers et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 24 (2009) 206–220interfaces), organizations may also establish informal integration mechanisms to minimize divergent perspectives and enhance a  sense ofmutual interests (Nohria andGhoshal,1994). Informal integrationmechanisms refer to collective goals and interests captured  by a shared organizational vision (Tsai andGhoshal,1998). A shared organizational vision generates alignment of goals and values that  result into increased access to and interaction between differentiated organizational units (Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000). In line  with these prior literatures,we distinguish between (1) cross-functional interfaces and (2) shared vision to uncover the importance of  organizational integration mechanisms.  In addition to organizational integrationmechanisms, theory has brought forward the importance of topmanagement teams in  strategically integrating structurally differentiated venturing and exploitative units (Gilbert, 2006; O'Reilly and Tushman, 2004;  Smith and Tushman, 2005). Top management teams need to allow departure from existing knowledge in venturing units, yet  establish cross-fertilization and synergies with ongoing businesses. Following previous literature, we distinguish between formal and  informal TMT integration mechanisms that have been associated with managing these inconsistencies and synergies: (1) group  contingency rewards and (2) social integration (cf. O'Reillyet al.,1989; Shawetal., 2001;Siegel andHambrick, 2005; Smith et al.,1994).  TMT group contingency rewards are an important formal TMT integration mechanism that creates outcome interdependency  across TMT members and provides incentive for cooperation across venturing and mainstream units (Harrison et al., 2002).  Fig. 1. Research framework: structural differentiation, formal and informal integration and corporate venturing.f  l  ,  l  f  l  210 J.H. Burgers et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 24 (2009) 206–220TMT social integration establishes informal intrinsic values among top management team members to discuss and to  motivate cooperation across differentiated units. Both group contingency rewards and social integration are therefore  important TMT integration mechanisms for fostering collaboration across differentiated organizational units.  3.2.1. Cross-functional interfaces  Prior studies have shown that establishing formal communication channels is beneficial to exchanging and integrating existing  knowledgebetweenhighly interdependentunits (Daft and Lengel,1986;Gupta andGovindarajan,1991).However, given that applying  cross-functional interfaces is costly and increases complexity, Tushman and Nadler (1978) argued such mechanisms may have  detrimental effects in cases of units with low levels of interdependence. The costs and complexity associated with cross-functional  interfaces placeanunnecessary burdenonventuringactivities andhinder the coexistenceofmultiple time frames acrossdifferentiated  units by imposing a formal integrative architecture (Mintzberg, 1979; Repenning and Sterman, 2002). Consequently, formal  organizational integrationmight lead to role conflicts between short-termorientedmainstreamunits and long-termorientedventures  (Burgelman, 1985; Floyd and Lane, 2000) and lessen the contributive natures of structural differentiation on corporate venturing. By  reducing the flexibility and the variance of underlying knowledge sources, cross-functional interfaces result in more local search  (Benner and Tushman, 2002; Repenning and Sterman, 2002; Zahra and George, 2002). This hinders organizations to venture into  new territories (Burgelman, 2002; Gatignon et al., 2002) as corporate ventures are overwhelmed by forces of business-as-usual  (O'Reilly and Tushman, 2004). O'Reilly and Tushman (2004) indicated that connecting differentiated units through formal  organizational integration mechanisms led to the development of less breakthrough products. Volberda (1998) argued that  cross-functional interfaces reduce the autonomy of differentiated units and inhibit their exploration activities. He suggested that  increased integration led to a more vulnerable system, as “disturbances in one part were reproduced throughout the  organization” (Volberda, 1998: 157). Because of their exploratory nature, ventures are likely to cause such disturbing effects  (Block and MacMillan, 1993). In other words, formal cross-functional interfaces diminish the positive effect of structural  differentiation on corporate venturing.  Hypothesis 2. Cross-functional interfaces will have a negative effect on the relationship between structural differentiation and  corporate venturing.  3.2.2. Shared organizational vision  A shared organizational visionmay overcome the pragmatic boundaries between venturing andmainstream units by creating a  common language and mutual understanding (Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998). A shared language is vital for effective communication  (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990), and facilitates knowledge exchange and combination (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998). A shared vision  can therefore help corporate ventures to recognize the value of potential organizational knowledge sources (Sinkula et al., 1997).  Dougherty (1992) argued that shared understanding is essential to bring forward innovations in firms comprised of separated  units with disparate thought worlds. A shared vision increases the willingness of organizational members to consider and  incorporate opposing views and facilitates the legitimacy of local venturing activities throughout the organization (Subramaniam  and Youndt, 2005). This enables the acceptance of contrasting work methods of differentiated corporate ventures and mainstream  businesses (Ashforth andMael, 1989). In such cases of high ambiguity between units, a shared set of goals will be the only effective  way to establish coordination and control (Ouchi, 1980). It leads to a consistent corporate culture that allows employees to  coordinate activities and economize on communication costs across unit boundaries (Camerer and Vepsalainen, 1988). We argue  therefore that the configuration of structural differentiation and a shared organizational vision significantly increases corporate  venturing.  Hypothesis 3. A shared organizational visionwill have a positive effect on the relationship between structural differentiation and  corporate venturing.  3.2.3. TMT group contingency rewards  A key issue for top management teams coordinating structurally differentiated units is to achieve strategic coherence and  synergies without losing local adaptability. TMT group contingency rewards compensate TMT members for the overall firm  performance instead of rewarding members for their individual performance (Collins and Clark, 2003). By rewarding group  outcomes, TMTgroup contingency rewards foster collaboration and create commitment to organizational goals (Bloom,1999). They  have been shown to increase communication, knowledge sharing and cooperation across TMT members, and motivate them to  transcend their unit's direct interests (Collins and Smith, 2006; Shaw et al., 2001). TMTgroup contingency rewards are particularly  important to structurally differentiated venturing units, as the potentially disruptive nature of venturing activitiesmay increase role  conflict within topmanagement teams (Siegel andHambrick, 2005). Group contingency rewards reduce interpersonal competition  and facilitate mutual adjustment between managers of differentiated venturing and mainstream units (Pfeffer, 1995). Hence, TMT  group contingency rewards cause top management team members to direct attention and corresponding behavior to achieving  integrative value across differentiated venturing and exploitative units (Smith and Tushman, 2005). Whereas organizational  members located at structurally differentiated units may have difficulty seeing beyond their unit's interests, TMTmembers are in a  much better position to oversee all units (Gilbert, 2006). They are able to identify opportunities to share resources and to establish  balanced resource allocation to facilitate the coexistence of venturing and exploitative units. Accordingly, we argue that TMTgroup  contingency rewards positively moderate the relationship between structural differentiation and corporate venturing.  Hypothesis 4. TMT group contingency rewards will have a positive effect on the relationship between structural differentiation  211J.H. Burgers et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 24 (2009) 206–220and corporate venturing.  3.2.4. TMT social integration  Social integration within TMTs increases negotiation, compromise, and collaboration between organizational units  (Michel and Hambrick, 1992). However, social integration may result into groupthink within top management teams, which  leads to selective perception of opportunities for knowledge and resource integration across differentiated units (Janis, 1982). Meta-  analytic findings suggest that socially integrated teams are therefore only beneficial to highly interdependent organizational units  (Beal et al., 2003). TMT social integration decreases the ability of ventures to break away from existing knowledge sources and  competences. Because of the rather low to moderate interdependency between venturing and mainstream units, we argue  that Tripsas and Gavetti (2000) and Burgelman (2002) showed that top managers discouraged search activities that were not  consistent with the existing business model. Moreover, TMT social integration decreases the willingness of TMT members to  discuss conflicting demands and force the confrontation of competing goals of venturing and mainstream units. In such cases the  minority opinion of the structurally differentiated venture is often not taken into account (Smith and Tushman, 2005). In otherwords,  the more structurally differentiated a venture is, the less likely a socially integrated TMT is to allocate the required resources to the  venture. Conversely, if venturing activities are part of a mainstream business unit, i.e. low level of structural differentiation, they may  receive the necessary resources through routine allocation processes associatedwithmainstream units. We argue therefore that TMT  social integration decreases the positive relationship between structural differentiation and corporate venturing.  Hypothesis 5. TMT social integration will have a negative effect on the relationship between structural differentiation and  corporate venturing.  4. Methods  4.1. Data collection  Using theReachdatabase,we randomly identified a sample of 4000firms in theNetherlands that covered a broad rangeof industries.  Reach is the most comprehensive company database in the Netherlands. It provides basic company and financial information for all  companies registered at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce. To deal with potential common method bias, we collected data for the  independent and dependent variables at two different points in time (Podsakoff et al., 2003). In 2005, a survey assessing structural  differentiation and integrationmechanismswas administered to the executive directors of the 4000 firms. To ensure confidentiality, we  agreed not to reveal the name of the executive director and asked for the questionnaire to be returned directly to the research team. This  reduces the possibility of social desirability bias (Podsakoff et al., 2003). Executive directors from452firms returned their questionnaire,  representing a response rate of 11.3%. In 2006, approximately tenmonths after the first survey, a second surveywasmailed to the same  452executivedirectors to assess theirfirm's corporate venturingactivities.Wereceived240completed surveys, representinganeffective  response rate of 53.1%. Compared to the original sample, our final response rate of 6% is not uncommon in empirical studies  targeting executives (cf. Koch and McGrath, 1996; Lepak et al., 2003; Ozgen and Baron, 2007; Simons et al., 1999). The  average size of the firms was 495.39 (SD=3098.15) full-time employees and the average firm age was 40.56 years  (SD=34.97). The firms were operating in several industries covering manufacturing (52%), construction (17%), trade (6%),  transportation (5%), financial services (7%), and professional services (12%). The respondents of these 240 firms had an  average company tenure of 13.57 years (SD=10.17).  4.2. Validation of method  Although partly explained by the separatedmeasurements of our independent and dependent variables, the low final response  rate may increase concerns about nonresponse bias, as unobserved determinants of the decision to respond to the questionnaire  could have an effect on our study variables (Huselid, 1995). In such cases of potential nonrandom exclusion of observations a  sample selection bias correction technique is warranted (Berk, 1983). We therefore tested for nonresponse bias by examining  differences between respondents and nonrespondents in three different ways.  First, we compared sample characteristics of (a) the 452 respondents of 2005 vs. initial sample of 4000 firms, (b) the 240  respondents of 2006 vs. the initial sample of 4000 firms, and (c) the 240 respondents of 2006 vs. the 452 respondents in 2005. T-tests  showedno significantdifferences based on the number of full-time employees,firmage, and revenue in all three comparisons. Second,  we compared early and late respondents in terms of demographic characteristics and model variables. These comparisons did not  reveal any significant differences (pb .05), indicating that nonresponse bias was not a problem. Third, we formally controlled for  possible nonresponse bias by applying a sample selection bias correction technique known as the Heckman procedure (cf. Berk,1983;  Huselid,1995; Koch andMcGrath,1996; Lepak et al., 2003). The first step of the procedure is obtaining a probit estimation to estimate  whether the sample is biased. The dependent is a dummy gauging whether the firm has participated in the survey or not. The  explanatory variables arefirmsize (numberof employees),firmage (inyears of existence) and industrymembership (1-digit SIC-code).  The predicted values of the probit estimation are multiplied by−1.0, and then used to calculate the inverse Mill's ratio1 (Berk, 1983;  1 Inverse Mill's ratioi= f(zi)/(1−  ^  F(zi)) where (zi) is the negative of the predicted value, f(zi) is the density value, and F(zi) is the distribution value.  Koch andMcGrath,1996). As a second step, the inverseMill's ratio is plugged into the regression analyses as a control variable to correct  212 J.H. Burgers et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 24 (2009) 206–220for possible bias due to nonresponse. If the significance levels and betas of our hypothesized variables would change, this indicates that  nonresponse bias is influencing ourfindings.2 As shown in theResults section, our empiricalfindings remained the same after including  the inverse Mill's ratio, indicating that nonresponse bias was not a concern in our study.  To address potential single-informant bias (Venkatraman and Grant, 1986), we surveyed an additional top management team  member in each responding firm for both the 2005 and the 2006 sample. In 2005 the follow-up survey resulted in 36 responses  from the 240 firms in our final sample, and in 2006 we received 57 responses from additional top management team members. To  statistically demonstrate how consensual raters are within a single organizational context, we calculated the average rwg for each  organization (Kozlowski and Hults, 1987). The rwg for organizations ranged from .72 to .99 with a median of .92 (mean .92) for the  independent variables survey, and ranged from .78 to .99 with a median of .96 (mean of .95) for the dependent variables survey.  Following the procedure of James et al. (1984) we also calculated the average rwg per variable for differentiation (.89), cross-  functional integration (.91), shared vision (.93), TMT social integration (.94), TMTgroup contingency rewards (.86), and venturing  (.94). Overall, the rwg values indicate sufficient agreement within organizations for both the independent and dependent variables.  4.3. Measurement and validation of constructs  This study used existing multi-item scales that were verified through various analyses (items of constructs are provided in the  Appendix A).  4.3.1. Dependent variable  Corporate venturingwasmeasured through five items (α=.82) adapted from Zahra (1996). Themeasure captured the extent to  which firms enter into new business fields by creating new ventures. To validate the measure for corporate venturing, we related  the scores on the dependent variable to a separate overall four-item scale of innovativeness (α=.82) based on Bell (2005). We  expect that the extent to which firms create new ventures will be related to the extent to which they pursue innovations and are  leading in the market regarding new products and services. Our expectation that corporate venturing would be related to the  overall measure of innovativeness was corroborated by significant positive correlations (r=.40, pb .001). We also related the score  on corporate venturing to the R&D investments as a percentage of annual sales (r=.28, pb .001) and to the percentage of revenues  in the last 3 years that is attributable to new products and services (r=.33, pb .001). Both significant and positive correlations  provide additional evidence for the validity of our measure of corporate venturing.  4.3.2. Independent and moderating variables  Structural differentiationwas measured with a six-item scale (α=.79) based on Jansen et al. (forthcoming). The items captured  the extent to which organizations separate innovation and efficiency activities in different autonomous organizational units. Five  items were used to measure cross-functional interfaces (α=.73). Based on Gupta and Govindarajan (2000), we included multiple  items that measured the extent to which firms use cross-functional teams, temporary work groups and liaison personnel. The  measure for shared organizational vision (α=.87) was adapted from Sinkula et al. (1997) and refers to the extent to which firms  have collective goals and shared aspirations. TMT group contingency rewards (α=.80) refers to the extent to which top  management team incentives, such as bonuses and profit sharing, were tied to overall firm performance. We constructed a four-  item measure for TMT group contingency rewards based on Collins and Clark (2003). TMT social integration (α=.85) was  measured by five items adapted from Smith et al. (1994). The items reflected the attraction to the top management team,  satisfaction with other top management team members, and the social interaction among team members (O'Reilly et al., 1989).  We assessed the construct validity of all items pertaining to our constructs through exploratory and confirmatory factor  analysis (CFA). After deleting several items (see Appendix A), the exploratory factor analysis clearly replicated the intended factor  structure. Each item loaded on its intended factor (all factor loadings were .55 or above with no cross-loadings above .30), and all  factors had eigenvalues greater than one, supporting the six factor solution. An integrated CFA on all remaining items (with each  item constrained to load only on the factor for which it was the proposed indicator) yielded a model that fitted the data well (χ2/  df=1.77, comparative fit index [CFI]=.90 incremental fit index [IFI]=.90, root-mean-square error of approximation [RMSEA]=.057).  Item loadingswere as proposed and significant (pb .01). Finally, Cronbach alpha's for our constructs all exceeded the commonly used cut-  off of .70. These findings provide strong support for the reliability and validity of our measurements.  4.3.3. Control variables  In the empirical study, we controlled for possible confounding effects by including various relevant control variables. As  larger firmsmay havemore resources, yet may lack the flexibility to venture, we included the natural logarithm of the number of  full-time employees to account for firm size. A firm's age, measured by the natural logarithm of the number of years since its  founding, was also included. Previous studies have argued that inertia may inhibit older firms from developing corporate  ventures (cf. Zahra and Hayton, 2008). Past performance indicates the degree of slack in a firm, and as such might be an  important antecedent to the level of corporate entrepreneurial activities in a firm (cf. Zahra and Hayton, 2008). Past  performance was measured with a five-item scale capturing a firm's ROI, sales growth, profit growth, attracting new customers,  2 For a more detailed description of the procedure we refer to Berk (1983) and Koch and McGrath (1996).  andmarket share growth (α=.82). Based on previous literature, a four-itemmeasurewas included that captured environmental  dynamism (Jansen et al., 2006). The scale for environmental dynamism (α=.80) tapped into the rate of change of the  competitive environment. Previous studies have shown that dynamism can significantly influence corporate venturing (cf.  Zahra, 1993). Finally, to control for additional industry effects, we included seven industry dummies: manufacturing,  construction, trade, transportation, financial services, professional services, and other industries.  5. Results  Table 1 presents descriptive statistics and correlations for the variables. Table 2 presents the results of themoderated regression  analyses for venturing. Prior to the creation of the interaction terms, we mean centered the independent variables. To examine  multicollinearity, we calculated variance inflation factors (VIF) for each of the regression equations. The maximum VIF within the  models was 2.6, which is well below the rule-of-thumb cut-off of 10. Model 1 contains the moderators and control variables. The  model included 6 of the 7 industry dummies, as manufacturing was used as the reference group. Model 2 introduces the effect of  structural differentiation on corporate venturing (Hypothesis 1) and model 3 examines the moderating effects of the formal and  informal integration mechanisms (Hypothesis 2–5). Model 4 added the inverse Mill's ratio to correct for potential nonresponse  biases. The results show that nonresponse bias was not of concern in our analysis, as the inverse Mill's ratio was non-significant  and the effect sizes and significance of our model variables did not seem to be effected by adding the inverse Mill's ratio. The  models showed significant increases in explanatory power. Regarding the control variables we can observe that past performance  (β=.306, pb .001) and environmental dynamism (β=.137, pb .05) have a positive effect on venturing (see Table 2). The identified  formal and informal integration mechanisms do not seem to have a direct effect on corporate venturing. Model 2 in Table 2  confirmed Hypothesis 1 that structural differentiation has a positive effect on corporate venturing (β=.160, pb .05). The increase  in explanatory power compared to model 1 was significant (pb .05).  The interaction terms in model 3 were all significant except the interaction of TMT group contingency rewards and structural  differentiation (see Table 2). The increase in explanatory powerwas significant compared tomodel 2 (pb .05). The interaction term  of cross-functional integration was significantly negative (β=− .145, pb .05) and confirms Hypothesis 2. The positive effect of  structural differentiation on venturing turns slightly negative when managers use cross-functional interfaces (see Fig. 2A). For  firms that make very limitedly use of cross-functional interfaces, the effect of structural differentiation on corporate venturing  becomes much stronger. If managers want to increase the level of venturing in an organization, they should combine low levels of  formal organizational integration with high degrees of structural differentiation (see Fig. 2A).

Fig. 2B shows that in the case of structurally differentiated units, shared vision  is a tool to achieve synergies between the venture and the rest of the organization. When there is low informal coordination in the  form of a shared organizational vision between members of different organizational units, structural differentiation is negatively  influencing the level of venturing (see Fig. 2B).  The interaction term of TMT group contingency rewards and structural differentiation was non-significant in our model,  thereby not providing support for Hypothesis 4. We ran additional regressions without the other moderating effects to observe  whether the moderating effect of TMT group contingency rewards was perhaps already explained by the other integration  mechanisms, in particular TMT social integration. The additional regressions did not provide a significant moderating effect of TMT  group contingency rewards.  – Financial services .214  (.296)  .152  (.294)  .119  (.289)  − .027  (.350)  – Professional services .587⁎  (.263)  .569⁎  (.260)  .575⁎  (.257)  .441  (.314)  – Other industries .387  (1.164)  .228  (1.154)  .044  (1.138)  − .178  (1.177)  Environmental dynamism .137⁎  (.062)  .132⁎  (.062)  .158⁎  (.061)  .162⁎⁎  (.062)  Log organizational size − .064  (.067)  − .074  (.066)  − .074  (.065)  − .097  (.072)  Log organizational age .039  (.088)  .039  (.087)  .064  (.086)  .015  (.109)  Past performance .306⁎⁎⁎  (.086)  .308⁎⁎⁎  (.085)  .318⁎⁎⁎  (.086)  .320⁎⁎⁎  (.086)  Moderating variables  Cross-functional interfaces .082  (.072)  .035  (.074)  − .011  (.076)  − .012  (.076)  Shared organizational vision .083  (.101)  .103  (.100)  .139  (.100)  .135  (.101)  TMT group contingency rewards .051  (.055)  .016  (.057)  .009  (.056)  .010  (.056)  TMT social integration − .058  (.095)  − .077  (.094)  − .087  (.096)  − .087  (.096)  Main effect  Structural differentiation .160⁎  (.067)  .141⁎  (.068)  .143⁎  (.068)  Interaction effects  Structural differentiation⁎ cross-functional interfaces − .145⁎  (.057)  − .146⁎  (.057)  Structural differentiation⁎shared organizational vision .238⁎⁎  (.081)  .239⁎⁎  (.081)  Structural differentiation⁎TMT group contingency rewards .034  (.040)  .035  (.040)  Structural differentiation⁎TMT social integration − .171⁎  (.074)  − .174⁎  (.075)  Sample selection correction  Inverse Mill's ratio −3.528  (4.750)  R2 .199 .219 .260 .262  F-value for change in R2 5.658⁎ 3.057⁎ .552  ⁎pb .05; ⁎⁎pb .01; ⁎⁎⁎pb .001.  aN=240; unstandardized coefficients are reported; standard errors in parentheses.  bManufacturing served as reference group in regression analyses.  215J.H. Burgers et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 24 (2009) 206–220The significantly negative moderation effect of top management team social integration on the relationship between structural  differentiation and venturing (β=− .171, pb .05) confirmed Hypothesis 5. Thus the effect of structural differentiation on corporate  venturing becomes significantly stronger if firms make limitedly use of TMT social integration (see Fig. 2C). In case of high top  management team social integration there is a slight negative effect of structural differentiation on venturing.  6. Discussion  Conceptual arguments assert that – because of the necessity to allow local adaptability while facilitating knowledge-sharing  between units – successfully managing corporate venturing in established firms is complex and difficult to achieve. Recent  research started to explore how organizations may use configurations of differentiation and integration mechanisms to  simultaneously achieve adaptability and coherence (Heller, 1999; O'Reilly and Tushman, 2004). We tested this core idea by  exploring how combinations of structurally differentiation and various types of integration mechanisms contribute to establishing  loose-coupling architectures that facilitate corporate venturing in established firms. Based on two dimensions, (1) formal and  informal, and (2) organizational and TMT, we delineated four types of integration mechanisms.  Our findings indicate that organizations differentiating venturing activities from ongoing business activities enhance their  corporate venturing activities, thereby providing support for Hypothesis 1. In this sense, our study shedsmore light on the debate  between those scholars arguing for more autonomy (e.g. Burgelman, 1985) versus those arguing for more integration  Fig. 2. A. Interaction of structural differentiation and cross-functional interfaces. B. Interaction of structural differentiation and shared organizational vision.  C. Interaction of structural differentiation and TMT social integration.  216 J.H. Burgers et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 24 (2009) 206–220(Chesbrough, 2000; Thornhill and Amit, 2001). Ceteris paribus, our findings support the former arguments that structural  differentiation allows exploratory and exploitative activities to coexist. Establishing separate venturing units helps organizations  to buffer experimentation and the development of new competences from ongoing operations (Burgelman,1985; Gilbert, 2005).  However, our research findings also suggest that the previously asserted effect of differentiation on facilitating corporate  venturing is strongly influenced by the use of integrationmechanisms. Future studies should therefore focus on configurations of  differentiation and integrationmechanismswhen studying corporate venturing, instead of focusing on a single differentiation or  integration mechanism.  Regarding themoderating effects of organizational integrationmechanisms, ourfindings supportHypothesis 2 that using formal  organizational integration (i.e. cross-functional interfaces) to establish horizontal coordination and knowledge transfer across  structurally differentiated units impedes corporate venturing. This finding confirms the claim of Tushman and Nadler (1978), who  argued that “more simple mechanisms should be utilized to the fullest possible extent; given their greater cost, the more complex  integratingmechanisms should only be used for residual interdependence” (1978: 621). Given the low interdependence of ventures  andmainstream units, therewill simply be no residual interdependence, while ventures would still incur the costs, time and effort  associated with such complex integration mechanisms. Additionally, the reciprocality of knowledge flows associated with formal  organizational integration mechanisms could place the venture under close scrutiny, making the venture more susceptible to  business pressures in its early stages (Burgelman, 1985). Accordingly, our study provides new insights into venturing and  organizational learning theory by showing that cross-functional interfaces have a strongnegative effect on the relationship between  structural differentiation and corporate venturing. The link with differentiation and corporate venturing enhances our  understanding of the complex contingencies associated with integration mechanisms. It points to the relevance for organizational  learning theory to not only look at the benefits of integration mechanisms in terms of enhanced knowledge sharing, but also at the  costs involved at establishing and maintaining integrative mechanisms.  Our results support Hypothesis 3 that informal organizational integration (i.e. shared organizational vision) contribute to  corporate venturing by enabling organizations to achieve strategic coherence and integration of structurally differentiated  organizational units. Our results contribute to previous literatures concerning the importance of shared values and collective goals  to compensate for structural differentiation to create loosely-coupled systems (Orton andWeick, 1990; Tsai, 2002). A shared sense  of direction and collective frame of reference creates a common language that allows differentiated venturing units to effectively  communicate and share knowledge with established organizational units (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998; Orton and Weick, 1990).  Our findings regarding cross-functional interfaces and a shared organizational vision point out that there is an important  discrepancy in the effects of formal and informal organizational integration mechanisms. Using formal integration mechanisms in  combination with structural differentiation results in organizations composed of conflicting formal architectures. The complexity  and rigidity of formal integration mechanisms have detrimental effects on corporate venturing, while informal integration  mechanisms seem complementary to structurally differentiation. This provides new insights into the effects of organizational  integration mechanisms, which have previously been associated with positive outcomes (cf. Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000).  We expected a positive effect of formal top management team integration (i.e. TMT group contingency rewards) on the  relationship between structural differentiation and corporate venturing, yet we found no support for such a moderating effect as  predicted in Hypothesis 4. Although group contingency rewards have been shown to create outcome interdependencies that  necessitate coordination and collaboration among top management team members (Siegel and Hambrick, 2005), our study  indicates that they do not enhance corporate venturing activities within structurally differentiated organizations. A possible  explanation for the insignificant relationship could be that the creation of collaboration through top management team  contingency rewards is not a sufficient condition for establishing strategic synergies among venturing and mainstream  organizations units. It might be of influence for what group outcome the top managers are rewarded. Based on prior research we  used a measure that focused on firm performance as underlying aspect (cf. Collins and Clark, 2003). Future research could address  other aspects of organizational performance such as innovativeness or growth achieved through venturing that may influence the  relationship between structural differentiation and corporate venturing.  We found that informal top management team social integration had a negative impact on the relationship between structural  differentiation and corporate venturing, as predicted by Hypothesis 5. This underpins prior literatures which suggest that socially  integrated top management teams may suffer from groupthink (Janis, 1982). Highly cohesive topmanagement teams decrease the  access to divergent perspectives and may decrease the ability of TMT members to evaluate alternative solutions for resource  allocation (Srivastava and Lee, 2005). This in turn leads to less understanding of and support for structurally differentiated ventures.  Thisfinding also contributes to theory on role conflict. Structural differentiation sends amessage that units should stick to their own  knitting, but if senior teams are very cohesive, organizational members also receive a signal that integration is positive. Sending  mixed signals to employees creates role conflict and weakens interpersonal trust (Floyd and Lane, 2000). Sillince (2005) put  forward a theoretical argument that attempts at structural differentiation are, therefore, only successful if they are followed by  differentiation rhetoric from top management. Our findings contribute to previous insights by showing that firms wanting to  increase their venturing output through structural differentiation should limit social integration across TMT members.  Our study confirms the importance of structural differentiation to enabling the coexistence of exploration and exploitation.  However, it also shows that certain integrativemechanisms such as cross-functional interfaces and TMTsocial integration decrease  the development of venturing activities. This is in sharp contrast with recent arguments made in organizational ambidexterity  literatures that top management may be in the best position to integrate differentiated units through TMT social integration  (Gilbert, 2006; O'Reilly and Tushman, 2004). In this sense, we contribute to literatures on organizational ambidexterity by showing  that achieving integration through cross-functional interfaces and socially integrated TMTs has negative outcomes for corporate  exploitative activities, in which the  uture conceptual development on  n be tied to the different needs of  hance their venturing efforts should  ivities from mainstream units allows  ures of more established units in the  217J.H. Burgers et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 24 (2009) 206–220organization. Second, management can enhance venturing efforts even further if they establish a shared organizational vision. This  increases the understanding between venturing units and established businesses, and ensures that ventures do not wander off in  unwanted directions but embrace the organizational goals. A third implication of our findings is that management should be  careful not to enforce toomuch integration of the venture andmainstream businesses. Establishing cross-functional interfaces and  socially integrated top management teams to integrate structurally differentiated ventures with the rest of the organization has  detrimental effects on corporate venturing, as thesemechanismsmake ventures susceptible to inertial forces present in the parent  organization.  6.1. Limitations and future research  Our study presents a first step toward uncovering the specific joint effects of structural differentiation and specific integration  mechanisms that are conducive to corporate venturing, and study limitations suggest the need for additional research. Although  we took great care in separating the collection of data on the independent and dependent variables to reduce the likelihood of  common method bias, the downside is that this had an adverse effect on our final response rate. Low response rates are an  increasing problem in contemporary management research, faced with a trend towards over-surveying (Weiner and Dalessio,  2006). Even if data samples are still sufficiently large, as in our casewith a final sample of 240 companies, there is still the potential  problem of limiting generalizability due to nonresponse biases, which is much more important than the actual response rate  (Rogelberg and Stanton, 2007). As such, we checked for differences between nonrespondents and respondents, as well as between  early and late respondents. Even though there were no significant differences, we were concerned it could still influence our  regression results. Therefore, we applied a Heckman-procedure as outlined by Berk (1983) and Koch and McGrath (1996) to  include an inverse Mill's ratio in the regression analysis, which controlled for potential biases in our sample. The low response rate  did not affect our results after inclusion of the sample bias correction (see Table 2). In other words, what wemight lose in response  rate was offset by the increased validity of our applied method of separating the measurement of the independent and the  dependent variables.  An issue for future research is to incorporate the relatedness of the venture to the parent firm. Relatedness determines to  a large extent the degree to which a venture can benefit from knowledge and capabilities present in mainstream businesses  (Sorrentino and Williams, 1995; Burgers et al., 2008). As such, highly related ventures might have stronger needs for  integrative linkages with the parent firm than more unrelated ventures. In this research we assumed that ventures are relatively  independent, with a small demand for knowledge-sharing possibilities. It would be worthwhile to investigate possible contingency  effects of relatedness on the relation between differentiation, integration and corporate venturing. If there are contingent effects of  relatedness, the question arises how corporations can adjust their differentiation and integrationmechanisms to the individual needs  of a venture.  6.2. Conclusion  Corporate venturing is a widely used approach among established firms to foster growth. With this research we set out to  investigate the effect of differentiation and integration on corporate venturing. Our findings show that firms seeking to  increase corporate venturing efforts should combine structural differentiation with a shared organizational vision to increase  the level of corporate venturing. Cross-functional interfaces and socially integrated top management teams, however, appear to  have detrimental effects on the level of venturing in a structurally differentiated organization. Instead, management should  minimize formal cross-functional interfaces and informal integration of top management if they seek to enhance the firm's  venturing efforts.

P. Jansen, Michiel P. Tempelaar, Frans A. J. van den Bosch, Henk W. Volberda  Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, 3062 PA Rotterdam, The Netherlands  {jjansen@rsm.nl, mtempelaar@rsm.nl, fbosch@rsm.nl, hvolberda@rsm.nl}  P  rior studies have emphasized that structural attributes are crucial to simultaneously pursuing exploration and exploitation,  yet our understanding of antecedents of ambidexterity is still limited. Structural differentiation can help ambidextrous  organizations to maintain multiple inconsistent and conflicting demands; however, differentiated exploratory and exploita-  tive activities need to be mobilized, coordinated, integrated, and applied. Based on this idea, we delineate formal and  informal senior team integration mechanisms (e.g., contingency rewards and social integration) and formal and informal  organizational integration mechanisms (e.g., cross-functional interfaces and connectedness) and examine how they medi-  ate the relationship between structural differentiation and ambidexterity. Overall, our findings suggest that the previously  asserted direct effect of structural differentiation on ambidexterity operates through informal senior team (i.e., senior team  social integration) and formal organizational (i.e., cross-functional interfaces) integration mechanisms. Through this richer  explanation and empirical assessment, we contribute to a greater clarity and better understanding of how organizations may  effectively pursue exploration and exploitation simultaneously to achieve ambidexterity.  Key words : ambidexterity; dynamic capabilities; structural differentiation; formal integration mechanisms; informal  integration mechanisms; exploration; exploitation  History : Published online in Articles in Advance January 22, 2009.  Firms are increasingly confronted with paradoxical  challenges of exploiting existing competencies and  exploring new ones (Vera and Crossan 2004). Not only  do firms need to generate new knowledge associated  with new products and services for emerging markets,  they also need to leverage current competences and  exploit existing products and services (Danneels 2002).  Achieving long-term success requires a dynamic capa-  bility enabling firms to satisfy current demands while  simultaneously being prepared for tomorrow’s develop-  ments (Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004). In this sense, prior  literatures have argued that successful organizations are  ambidextrous (Duncan 1976)—they generate competi-  tive advantages through revolutionary and evolutionary  change (Tushman and O’Reilly 1996), or exploratory  and exploitative innovation (Benner and Tushman 2003,  Jansen et al. 2006).  Whereas most studies have focused on competitive  benefits (Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004, He and Wong  2004), far less attention has been given to uncover-  ing how firms may achieve ambidexterity. Exploration  and exploitation require fundamentally different and  inconsistent architectures and competencies that create  paradoxical challenges. Whereas exploration has been  associated with flexibility, decentralization, and loose  cultures, exploitation has been related to efficiency, cen-  tralization, and tight cultures (Benner and Tushman  2003). Recently, studies are beginning to address orga-  nizational attributes such as structural differentiation  (Gilbert 2005, Tushman and O’Reilly 1996) and orga-  nizational context (Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004) that  enable firms to balance these conflicting demands and  to achieve ambidexterity. However, there is little evi-  dence about the role of structural differentiation and  integration in ambidextrous organizations. Yet, scholars  have emphasized that both attributes are core elements  in the ability of firms to pursue exploratory and exploita-  tive activities simultaneously (Siggelkow and Levinthal  2003, Tushman and O’Reilly 1996). We conceptualize  organizational ambidexterity as an organizational-level  dynamic capability and argue that structural differen-  tiation and integration play a crucial role in a firm’s  ability to pursue exploratory and exploitative innovation  concurrently.  This study adds to the emerging dialogue on orga-  nizational attributes of ambidexterity in at least three  important ways. First, we recognize organizational  ambidexterity as a dynamic capability by arguing that it  refers to the routines and processes by which ambidex-  trous organizations mobilize, coordinate, and integrate  dispersed contradictory efforts, and allocate, reallocate,  combine, and recombine resources and assets across dif-  ferentiated exploratory and exploitative units (O’Reilly  and Tushman 2007, Teece 2007). We argue that orga-  nizations need to develop such a dynamic capability  to implement effective ways of achieving ambidexter-  ity. Our study broadens the conceptual interpretation of  organizational ambidexterity and suggests that it is dif-  ficult to achieve yet rare and not easily imitated, and  797  Jansen et al.: Structural Differentiation and Ambidexterity  798 Organization Science 20(4), pp. 797–811, © 2009 INFORMS  provides organizations with competitive advantages over  time (Barney 1991). In this way, we contribute to recent  research linking the dynamic capabilities framework  to organizational ambidexterity (O’Reilly and Tushman  2007, Venkatraman et al. 2006).  Second, we provide new insights into the interrela-  tionship between structural differentiation, integration,  and ambidexterity. Structural differentiation, or the sub-  division of organizational tasks into different units (Hall  1977, Lawrence and Lorsch 1967), can help ambidex-  trous organizations to maintain multiple competencies  that address paradoxical demands (Gilbert 2005). It pro-  tects ongoing operations in exploitative units from inter-  fering with emerging competences being developed in  exploratory units. Hence, it ensures that exploratory  units are able to enjoy the required freedom and flex-  ibility to develop new knowledge and skills. Although  structurally differentiating exploratory and exploitative  activities is important to reduce resource and rou-  tine rigidity (Gilbert 2005), ambidextrous organizations  also need to facilitate collective action (O’Reilly and  Tushman 2004). Integrative efforts are therefore a nec-  essary step into appropriating the potential value embed-  ded in spatially separated activities (Sirmon et al. 2007).  We argue that achieving ambidexterity requires the  subsequent integration and application of differentiated  exploratory and exploitative efforts without corrupting  the internal structures and processes within each unit’s  area of operation (Gilbert 2006, O’Reilly and Tushman  2007). Accordingly, our study examines how integration  mechanisms mediate the relationship between structural  differentiation and achieving ambidexterity.  Third, scholars have acknowledged the importance of  different types of integration mechanisms for becom-  ing ambidextrous. For instance, previous research has  suggested that ambidextrous designs involve differenti-  ated organizational units and tight senior team integra-  tion (Benner and Tushman 2003, Tushman and O’Reilly  1996). Senior team integration contributes to balanced  resource allocation and establishes cross-fertilization  across exploratory and exploitative activities (Jansen  et al. 2008, Smith and Tushman 2005). Other studies,  however, have argued that ambidextrous organizations  need to use formal and informal integration mecha-  nisms to increase knowledge flows across differenti-  ated exploratory and exploitative units (Gilbert 2006,  Westerman et al. 2006). Such organizational integration  mechanisms create permeability and enable organiza-  tions to obtain and apply strategically valuable combi-  nations. Until now, the relative influence of senior team  integration and organizational integration mechanisms is  still unclear, and scholars have called for more research  in this area. Our study distinguishes between senior team  and organizational integration mechanisms, and investi-  gates how these specific types mediate the relationship  between structural differentiation and ambidexterity.  Figure 1 Hypothesized Model  Structural  differentiation Ambidexterity  Senior team  contingency  rewards  Cross-functional  interfaces  Senior team  social integration  Connectedness  In the next section, we present the literature review  and hypotheses underlying our research model as pre-  sented in Figure 1. Then, we present the empirical find-  ings using data from 230 organizations operating in  various industries. We conclude with a discussion of the  results, implications, and issues for further research.  Literature Review and Hypotheses  Exploration and Exploitation in Ambidextrous  Organizations  Studies have predominantly suggested that organiza-  tions pursuing exploration and exploitation simultane-  ously obtain superior financial performance (Gibson  and Birkinshaw 2004, He and Wong 2004, Lubatkin  et al. 2006). Combining exploration and exploitation  not only helps organizations to overcome structural  inertia that results from focusing on exploitation, but  also refrains them from accelerating exploration without  gaining benefits (Levinthal and March 1993). Although  both types of activities are important for organizational  survival, they create paradoxical challenges. Whereas  exploration results from experimentation, flexibility, and  divergent thinking, exploitation is associated with effi-  ciency, refinement, and focus (March 1991). In this  study, we apply the distinction between exploration and  exploitation to learning and innovation, albeit of differ-  ent types. Prior studies such as Benner and Tushman  (2003), Danneels (2002), and He and Wong (2004) have  explicitly embraced the idea that exploratory innova-  tions are designed to meet the needs of emerging cus-  tomers or markets. Exploratory innovations require new  knowledge or departure from existing knowledge and  the pursuit of new technological and customer compe-  tences (Danneels 2002, Jansen et al. 2006). They offer  new designs, demand new systems and procedures, and  attract new sets of customers through new channels of  distribution (Abernathy and Clark 1985). Conversely,  exploitative innovations meet the needs of existing cus-  tomers or markets (Benner and Tushman 2003, He  and Wong 2004). They deepen existing knowledge by  Jansen et al.: Structural Differentiation and Ambidexterity  Organization Science 20(4), pp. 797–811, © 2009 INFORMS 799  refining established technological and customer compe-  tences (Danneels 2002, Jansen et al. 2006). Exploita-  tive innovations improve established designs by applying  existing skills and strengthening customer ties through  an increase in the effectiveness of existing distribution  channels (Abernathy and Clark 1985).  Based on an examination of prior literatures, Gupta  et al. (2006) suggested two primary contenders of real-  izing a balance between exploratory and exploitative  innovations: punctuated equilibrium and ambidexter-  ity. Punctuated equilibrium refers a sequential pattern  of longer periods of exploitation and short bursts of  exploration (e.g., Burgelman 2002). Studies on the  second contender, ambidexterity, consider exploration  and exploitation to be orthogonal and refer to the  simultaneous pursuit and combination of exploratory  and exploitative innovation within organizations (e.g.,  Benner and Tushman 2003, Gibson and Birkinshaw  2004, Tushman and O’Reilly 1996). Ambidextrous orga-  nizations buffer exploratory efforts from exploitative  activities by physically separating them across multiple  yet loosely organizational units (O’Reilly and Tushman  2004). We contribute to this view on achieving ambidex-  terity by examining the idea that exploratory and  exploitive activities should be differentiated yet subse-  quently integrated to generate value. We consider orga-  nizational ambidexterity as a dynamic capability that  goes beyond moving from one competence configura-  tion to another, but rather addresses and maintains mul-  tiple, inconsistent demands simultaneously (e.g., Gilbert  2006). Our approach allows us to uncover how ambidex-  trous organizations are able to successfully pursue mul-  tiple inconsistent innovation streams through generat-  ing integrative value across exploratory and exploitative  units (Tushman et al. 2006).  Structural Differentiation in Ambidextrous  Organizations  Prior studies have suggested that ambidextrous orga-  nizations are composed of structurally differentiated  exploratory and exploitative units (Benner and Tushman  2003, Tushman and O’Reilly 1996). Structural differ-  entiation refers to “the state of segmentation of the  organizational system into subsystems, each of which  tends to develop particular attributes in relation to the  requirements posed by its relevant external environment”  (Lawrence and Lorsch 1967, pp. 3–4). It establishes dif-  ferences across organizational units in terms of mind-  sets, time orientations, functions, and product/market  domains (Lawrence and Lorsch 1967, Golden and Ma  2003). In ambidextrous organizations, structural differ-  entiation results in spatially dispersed exploratory and  exploitative units at different locations (Benner and  Tushman 2003, Tushman and O’Reilly 1996). It creates  “pragmatic boundaries” (Carlile 2004) that safeguard  experimental activities from dominant managerial cog-  nitions and inertia present in the parent’s mainstream  activities (Benner and Tushman 2003). In this way,  ambidextrous organizations allow the coexistence of  inconsistent and paradoxical exploratory and exploita-  tive efforts at different locations where motivation can  be build entirely around emerging or mainstream busi-  ness opportunities (Gilbert 2005). It provides a sense of  freedom and ownership over specific work activities and  generates structural flexibility to adapt to local conflict-  ing task environments (Child 1984, Orton and Weick  1990).  Realizing Integrative Value Across Differentiated  Exploratory and Exploitative Units: Organizational  Ambidexterity as a Dynamic Capability  The coordination and integration of exploratory and  exploitative efforts across organizational units is a neces-  sary step in achieving ambidexterity (Gilbert 2006, Smith  and Tushman 2005, Tushman and O’Reilly 1996). As  O’Reilly and Tushman (2007, p. 17) suggest “the cru-  cial task here is not the simple organizational structural  decision in which the exploratory and exploitative sub-  units are separated, but the processes by which these units  are integrated in a value enhancing way.” The pursuit  of exploratory and exploitative activities in differentiated  units may lead to distinct operational capabilities or com-  petences at dispersed locations (Gilbert 2006). It enables  organizations to effectively execute routine day-to-day  activities and produce desired output (Winter 2003).  However, for these differentiated competences to be use-  ful, they must be effectively allocated, mobilized, and  integrated to generate new combinations of exploratory  and exploitative innovation (Sirmon et al. 2007). The  implementation or deployment of such combinations and  the achievement of ambidexterity requires new organiz-  ing logics and collective patterns of interaction (Helfat  and Peteraf 2003). The dynamic capabilities framework  recognizes this important aspect. It argues that dynamic  capabilities, which are embedded in the distinct ways  that organizations integrate, build, and recombine com-  petences flexibly across boundaries, are fundamental to  long-term strategic advantage (Eisenhardt and Martin  2000, Henderson and Cockburn 1994, Kogut and Zander  1992, Teece et al. 1997). Accordingly, we link research  on ambidexterity to the dynamic capabilities framework.  We propose that organizational ambidexterity refers to  the routines and processes by which organizations mobi-  lize, coordinate, and integrate dispersed exploratory and  exploitative efforts, and allocate, reallocate, combine,  and recombine resources and assets across differenti-  ated units. Organizational ambidexterity is a dynamic  capability that creates valuable new configurations of  exploratory and exploitative innovation by generating  and connecting previously unconnected ideas and knowl-  edge or recombining previously connected knowledge in  Jansen et al.: Structural Differentiation and Ambidexterity  800 Organization Science 20(4), pp. 797–811, © 2009 INFORMS  new ways (Kogut and Zander 1992). For example, Iansiti  and Clark (1994) argued that it is not the generation  of detailed knowledge sources within different domains  (i.e., operational capabilities at exploratory and exploita-  tive units) that is crucial, but rather the usage of architec-  tural knowledge to generate new possibilities for meet-  ing multiple contradictory customer demands. Thus, the  mere copresence of exploratory and exploitative activ-  ities in structurally differentiated organizational units  does not ensure the simultaneous pursuit of exploratory  and exploitative innovation. Achieving ambidexterity  creates paradoxical situations because the short-term  efficiency and control focus of exploitative units is  at odds with the long-term experimental focus and  decentralized architectures of exploratory units (Floyd  and Lane 2000). When differentiating exploratory and  exploitative efforts, organizations need to subsequently  establish certain integration mechanisms to coordinate  and integrate operational capabilities developed at spa-  tially dispersed locations. Hence, to resolve these para-  doxical situations, the mobilization, integration, and  deployment of operational capabilities at exploratory and  exploitative units are a necessary step in appropriating  value and achieving ambidexterity.  Organizational ambidexterity as a dynamic capability  is Path dependent in its emergence and idiosyncratic in  detail; however, it exhibits common features (Eisenhardt  and Martin 2000, p. 1116; Jansen et al. 2005). We indi-  cate that these commonalties involve distinct integration  mechanisms, such as senior team social integration  and cross-functional interfaces, each of which provides  specific ways of dealing with structural differentiation  in ambidextrous organizations (O’Reilly and Tushman  2004). We suggest four types of integration mechanisms  along two dimensions: (1) senior team versus organiza-  tional and (2) formal versus informal integration mecha-  nisms as common features of organizational ambidexter-  ity. First, prior studies have pointed at the distinct roles  of senior team and organizational integration mecha-  nisms in achieving ambidexterity. Senior team integration  mechanisms need to allow for the allocation of scarce  resources and the departure from existing competences  and skills within exploratory units (Gilbert 2005, Hill and  Rothaermel 2003), yet establish cross-fertilization and  strategic synergies with ongoing businesses in exploita-  tive units (Jansen et al. 2008, Tushman and O’Reilly  1996). Additionally, organizational integration mecha-  nisms need to enable ambidextrous organizations to  access and integrate knowledge sources flexibly across  relatively autonomous exploratory and exploitative units  (Galunic and Eisenhardt 2001, Gilbert 2006, Henderson  and Cockburn 1994). Second, based on the assumption  that certain integration mechanisms are richer and pro-  vide a higher information-processing capacity, prior lit-  eratures have distinguished between formal and infor-  mal integration mechanisms (March and Simon 1958,  Tsai 2002, Van de Ven et al. 1976). Formal integration  mechanisms are a means to coordinate and integrate dif-  ferentiated activities through pre-established mechanisms  and interfaces (Ghoshal et al. 1994). Informal integra-  tion mechanisms, on the other hand, refer to emergent  social properties and have been found to be of influ-  ence on boundary spanning across different units (Gal-  braith 1973, Tsai 2002). To uncover how organizations  reconcile conflicting demands across exploratory and  exploitative units and achieve ambidexterity, we examine  how formal as well as informal senior team and orga-  nizational integration mechanisms mediate the relation-  ship between structural differentiation and ambidexterity  (Martinez and Jarillo 1989, Westerman et al. 2006).  The Mediating Role of Senior Team  Integration Mechanisms  Senior teams in ambidextrous organizations typically  face role conflicts that may diminish acceptance of deci-  sions (Jansen et al. 2008, O’Reilly and Tushman 2004).  Especially when senior team members are responsible  for differentiated exploratory and exploitative units, the  likelihood of conflict is further exacerbated (Eisenhardt  et al. 1997, Tushman and O’Reilly 1996). Structural  differentiation may enhance self-interested behavior in  which senior team members perceive direct competi-  tion regarding the allocation of scarce resources (Bower  1970). Senior teams in ambidextrous organizations are  therefore expected to recognize and translate different,  ambiguous, and conflicting expectations across differen-  tiated exploratory and exploitative units into workable  strategies. Resolving this tension in senior management  teams is a crucial element in their organization’s abil-  ity to create integrative and synergetic value across  exploratory and exploitative activities and to achieve  ambidexterity (Teece 2007). Hence, we examine the  mediating role of two senior team integration mecha-  nisms that are considered to be beneficial to combining  strategic contradictions: formal senior team contingency  rewards and informal senior team social integration  (Jansen et al. 2008, Lubatkin et al. 2006, O’Reilly and  Tushman 2004, Siegel and Hambrick 2005, Smith and  Tushman 2005).  Senior Team Contingency Rewards. Contingency  rewards, which reflect the degree to which benefits for  individual team members depend on their team’s out-  come, are favorable to senior teams confronted with  pressures for mutual adjustment (Harrison et al. 2002,  Shaw et al. 2002, Wageman and Baker 1997). They  create an outcome interdependency within senior man-  agement teams (Slavin 1996, Wageman 1995) and urge  members to direct attention and behavior toward inter-  dependent rather than individual activities (Siegel and  Hambrick 2005). In this sense, ambidextrous organiza-  tions generate commitment to complex organizational  Jansen et al.: Structural Differentiation and Ambidexterity  Organization Science 20(4), pp. 797–811, © 2009 INFORMS 801  goals (Bloom 1999, Harris and Bromiley 2007) and fos-  ter collaboration across senior team members respon-  sible for differentiated exploratory and exploitative  units. Additionally, team contingency rewards encourage  senior team members to mobilize and integrate oper-  ational capabilities across differentiated units through  identifying ways to encourage new combinations (Smith  and Tushman 2005). In this sense, senior team mem-  bers transcend their unit’s direct interests and establish  new ways to achieve ambidexterity. Moreover, ambidex-  trous organizations may establish contingency rewards  to motivate senior team members to advance think-  ing and participate in clarifying problems and propos-  ing solutions to complex issues (Wageman 1995). This  reduces interpersonal competition and facilitates negoti-  ation and mutual adjustment across differentiated units  (Pfeffer 1995). Overall, ambidextrous organizations may  use contingency rewards to reconcile conflicts associated  with allocating resources to differentiated exploratory  and exploitative efforts. Hence,  Hypothesis 1. Senior team contingency rewards  mediate the relationship between structural differentia-  tion and ambidexterity.  Senior Team Social Integration. Social integration is  a multifaceted phenomenon that reflects the “attraction  to the group, satisfaction with other members of the  group, and social interaction among the group members”  (O’Reilly et al. 1989, p. 22). Socially integrated senior  teams are associated with increased negotiation, compro-  mise, and collaboration (Barkema and Shvyrkov 2007,  Michel and Hambrick 1992). Members of socially inte-  grated senior teams are not only expected to work harder  to recognize and seize opportunities, but also to leverage  operational capabilities across differentiated exploratory  and exploitative units. Social integration increases col-  laborative problem solving (De Cremer et al. 2008) and  facilitates senior executives to build realistic understand-  ings of key preferences and conflicting roles in senior  teams (Eisenhardt et al. 1997). In this sense, it provides  comfortable and familiar platforms that routinize con-  sideration of conflicting strategic agendas (Jehn et al.  1997). Hence, it stimulates critical debate that allows  senior team members to evaluate and redesign poten-  tial combinations of knowledge sources at differentiated  units. In this sense, senior team social integration con-  tributes to the mobilization and integration of opera-  tional capabilities at differentiated units to arrive at new  combinations of exploratory and exploitative activities.  It mediates the relationship between structural differen-  tiation and ambidexterity as social integration triggers  alternative ways to reconciling conflicting goals across  spatially distributes units and to generating portfolios  of knowledge resources underlying new products and  services.  Hypothesis 2. Senior team social integration medi-  ates the relationship between structural differentiation  and ambidexterity.  The Mediating Role of Organizational  Integration Mechanisms  Where senior team integration mechanisms enable bal-  anced resource allocation and strategic coherence in  ambidextrous organizations, organizational integration  mechanisms facilitate knowledge exchange and combi-  nation between differentiated exploratory and exploita-  tive units (Kogut and Zander 1992, Tsai and Ghoshal  1998). Through combination and integration of differen-  tiated skills and experiences, ambidextrous organizations  are able to add or remove product subsystems or change  linkages between subsystems underlying exploratory and  exploitative innovations. Thus, they are able to synchro-  nize, maintain, and further build portfolios of exploratory  and exploitative innovation simultaneously (Tushman  et al. 2006). Organizational integration mechanisms not  only facilitate new value creation through linking pre-  viously unconnected knowledge sources (Cohen and  Levinthal 1990), but also through providing opportunities  to leverage common resources and obtaining synergies  across exploratory and exploitative units (O’Reilly and  Tushman 2007). Integrative efforts are vital to ambidex-  trous organizations as existing knowledge sources in  exploitative units may need to be revisited, reinterpreted,  and applied in exploratory units due to changes in  the organization’s strategy or environment (Garud and  Nayyar 1994, Postrel 2002). We consider two organi-  zational integration mechanisms that have been associ-  ated with knowledge combination and integration: formal  cross-functional interfaces (Lawrence and Lorsch 1967,  Martinez and Jarillo 1991) and informal social relations  or connectedness (Jansen et al. 2006, Tsai and Ghoshal  1998).  Cross-Functional Interfaces. Ambidextrous organiza-  tions may use cross-functional interfaces such as liai-  son personnel, task forces, and teams (Gupta and  Govindarajan 2000) to enable knowledge exchange  across exploratory and exploitative units. Cross-func-  tional teams and task forces bring together employ-  ees from differentiated units who have distinct expertise  underlying innovation streams. They cut across ex-  ploratory and exploitative unit boundaries that are estab-  lished by spatially separating fundamentally different  learning modes. Knowledge sources underlying current  products and services in units may be underexplored due  to a lack of capabilities or complementary knowledge in  exploratory units (Prabhu et al. 2005). Cross-functional  interfaces facilitate organizational members from distinct  units to reach a common frame of reference and to build  understanding and agreement (Daft and Lengel 1986,  Egelhoff 1991). Gilbert (2006), for instance, showed  Jansen et al.: Structural Differentiation and Ambidexterity  802 Organization Science 20(4), pp. 797–811, © 2009 INFORMS  how a newspaper organization used cross-functional  teams and task forces to overcome differences, inter-  pret issues, and build understanding about paradoxical  cognitive frames across their newspaper (i.e., exploita-  tive) and internet publishing (i.e., exploratory) busi-  ness units. Organizational members from both types of  units are assembled in task forces or cross-functional  teams. They represent a flexible formal arrangement  because they can be disbanded after their specific task  has been completed. In addition, liaison personnel are  responsible for resolving differences across exploratory  and exploitative units to overcome disagreement and to  reduce equivocality of organizational goals (Daft and  Lengel 1986). Cross-functional interfaces provide plat-  forms that keep multiple innovation streams connected  by disseminating operational capabilities and learning  about new ways of achieving ambidexterity. Thus, cross-  functional interfaces facilitate the generation and recom-  bination of knowledge sources, yet retain the integrity  of contradictory structures and processes in exploratory  and exploitative units (Dougherty 2001, Gilbert 2006).  Hypothesis 3. Cross-functional interfaces mediate  the relationship between structural differentiation and  ambidexterity.  Connectedness. Connectedness concerns the overall  pattern of a firm’s social network in terms of density  (Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998, Sheremata 2000) and facil-  itates knowledge exchange (Jaworski and Kohli 1993).  Connectedness is essential for the emergence of shared  codes and language. It provides a common base of  understanding through which organizational members  with disparate experience, knowledge, and backgrounds  can transfer and integrate new ideas (Hansen 2002).  Dense social relations within ambidextrous organiza-  tions combat the polarization across exploratory and  exploitative units. They reduce the likelihood of con-  flict regarding goals and implementation by maintain-  ing the permeability of unit boundaries (Nelson 1989,  Rindfleisch and Moorman 2001). Increased interaction  fosters collaborative conflict resolution because mem-  bers from differentiated exploratory and exploitative  units have greater opportunities for creating win–win  situations. Krackhardt and Stern (1988) made a strong  case for the efficacy of cross-cutting social ties as  a conflict-reduction mechanism, arguing that the exis-  tence of dense social relations between organizational  units reduce disruptive conflict. Nelson’s (1989) study  of intergroup ties indicates that frequent interactions  between groups permit faster dispute resolution and pre-  vent the accumulation of grievances and grudges. Infor-  mal social relations also serve as information bridges  across exploratory and exploitative units, and contribute  to the search for new applications of exploitative efforts  or help those organizational members who want to  advertise their exploitative efforts in new areas (Nahapiet  and Ghoshal 1998). Thus, connectedness affects their  ability and motivation to integrate and recombine differ-  entiated knowledge sources at exploratory and exploita-  tive units, thereby mediating the relationship between  differentiation and ambidexterity.  Hypothesis 4. Connectedness mediates the relation-  ship between structural differentiation and ambidexterity.  Methods  Research Setting and Data Collection  We randomly identified a company sample (4,000 firms)  using a database from a commercial provider. The sam-  ple covered a broad range of industries and was restricted  to private firms with at least 25 employees. We ensured  that the informants were professionally interested, con-  scientious, and committed to providing accurate data by  assuring them of confidentiality and by offering them  a summary of the results. To deal with potential prob-  lems associated with single-informant bias and common  method bias, we temporarily separated the measurement  of our independent and dependent variables and col-  lected data at two different points in time. In 2005, a  survey assessing structural differentiation, senior team  integration mechanisms, and organizational integration  mechanisms was administered to the executive director  of our random sample of 4,000 companies. Executive  directors of 452 companies returned their questionnaire,  representing a response rate of 11.3%. In 2006, approx-  imately one year after the first survey, a second survey  was mailed to the same 452 executive directors to assess  their firm’s exploratory and exploitative innovation. We  received 230 usable surveys from executive directors,  or 50.9% of the original response. The executive direc-  tors had a mean age of 47.56 years (standard deviation  (s.d.)= 8 58) and amean company tenure of 13.64 years  (s.d. = 10 18). Firms in the final sample had an aver-  age size of 519.74 (s.d.= 3 183 12) full-time employees  and an average age of 41.74 (s.d. = 35 52). The firms  were operating in a wide range of industries covering  manufacturing (51.3%), construction (16.5%), wholesale  (6.5%), transportation (5.2%), financial services (7.8%),  other professional services (12.2%), and other industries  (0.4%). To test for nonresponse bias, we examined differ-  ences between respondents and nonrespondents for our  final sample. T -tests showed no significant differences  based on the number of full-time employees, total assets  of branches, and prior performance. We also compared  early and late respondents in terms of demographics and  model variables. These comparisons did not reveal any  differences (p < 0 05), showing that nonresponse bias  was not a problem.  To offset individual respondent bias and to examine  reliability issues associated with single-informant data,  we surveyed additional management team members in  Jansen et al.: Structural Differentiation and Ambidexterity  Organization Science 20(4), pp. 797–811, © 2009 INFORMS 803  2005 and 2006. In 2005, this follow-up survey resulted  in 38 responses, or 16.5% of the firms from the 2006  sample, that were comparable in size, age, and prior per-  formance to our final sample. In 2006, we conducted the  same follow-up for a result of 58 responses, or 25.7%  of the 2006 sample. We calculated an interrater agree-  ment score  r  wg    for data on study variables using the  2005 response for the independent and mediator vari-  ables and the 2006 response for the dependent vari-  able. The average r  wg  per variable (James et al. 1984)  for structural differentiation (0.89), senior team con-  tingency rewards (0.87), senior team social integration  (0.93), cross-functional integration (0.91), connectedness  (0.95), exploratory innovation (0.94), and exploitative  innovation (0.94) suggests adequate agreement amongst  respondents.  Measurement and Validation of Constructs  Although our study mostly used multi-item scales that  were verified through various analyses, an appropri-  ate scale for structural differentiation was not available  (items of constructs are provided in the appendix). Based  on a review of relevant of literatures, we generated items  to tap the domain of structural differentiation.  Dependent Variable: Ambidexterity. Following prior  studies, we considered exploratory and exploitative inno-  vation as orthogonal (Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004,  Gupta et al. 2006, He and Wong 2004) and used a two-  step approach to measure ambidexterity.  First, executive directors provided information on the  level of exploratory and exploitative innovation. The  measure for exploratory innovation was adapted from  Jansen et al. (2006). The resulting four-item scale for  exploratory innovation (  = 0 86) captures the extent  to which organizations depart from existing knowledge  and pursue radical innovations for emerging customers  or markets. A four-item scale ( = 0 70) measures firm-  level exploitative innovation (Jansen et al. 2006) and  captures the extent to which organizations build on  existing knowledge and pursue incremental innovations  that meet the needs of existing customers (Abernathy  and Clark 1985, Benner and Tushman 2003, Smith and  Tushman 2005). To provide evidence of convergent and  discriminant validity for exploratory and exploitative  innovation, we performed various analyses. Exploratory  factor analysis clearly replicated the intended two-factor  structure, with each item loading clearly on its intended  factor (all factor loadings were above 0.71 with cross-  loadings below 0.21) and all factors having eigenvalues  greater than one. In addition, we compared the scores on  exploratory and exploitative innovation with a separate  overall five-item scale of innovativeness (Zahra 1996;   = 0 91). Our expectation that both types of innovation  would be related to the overall measure of innovative-  ness was corroborated by significant positive correlations  (r = 0 60, p < 0 01; r = 0 28, p < 0 01). Finally, we  validated the scales of both types of innovation with  separate measures through which we asked respondents  to indicate the percentage of revenues in the last three  years that is attributable to (1) products and services  that are totally new to the firm and (2) products and  services that have been improved extensively. Correla-  tions between the scores for exploratory and exploitative  innovation, and both percentages, were much stronger  (r = 0 17 − −0 36; p < 0 01) than cross-correlations  (−0 03−−0 04; p > 0 10) between domains, providing  evidence of the convergent and discriminant validity of  both measures.  Second, prior studies have constructed measures for  ambidexterity in distinct ways: subtracting (He and Wong  2004), multiplying (Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004), and  adding (Lubatkin et al. 2006) exploratory and exploita-  tive innovation. To develop a measure for ambidexterity,  we followed the procedures recommended by Edwards  (1994) and sought the most interpretable approach for  combining our measures of exploratory and exploita-  tive innovation (see also Lubatkin et al. 2006). Given  the close link between ambidexterity and performance  (Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004, He and Wong 2004), we  ran four regression analyses with a seven-item measure  for performance as the dependent variable (see, e.g., Li  and Atuahene-Gima 2001) (  = 0 81). The first uncon-  strained model treats exploratory and exploitative innova-  tion as separate independent variables. Then, we ran three  constrained regression equations in which exploration  and exploitation were combined into a single index, first  by subtracting exploitation from exploration, second by  multiplying exploration and exploitation, and third by  summing the two. Following Edwards (1994), we cal-  culated F -values based on R  2  differences of the three  models and the unconstrained model. The additive model  proved to be superior to the other two approaches, the  F -test showed no significant loss of information com-  pared to the unconstrained model, and its R  2  (0.22) is  slightly higher than for the multiplicative model (0.20).  The subtractive model, however, appeared to have the  lowest explanatory power, which resulted in a signifi-  cant loss of explanatory power. Given these results from  Edwards’s (1994) test, we measured ambidexterity by  adding exploratory and exploitative innovation.  Independent and Mediating Variables. Based on a lit-  erature review, we developed a six-item scale for struc-  tural differentiation ( = 0 78) that taps into the extent  that organizations segment their organizational system  into spatially dispersed units, each of which tends to  develop a particular attribute in relation to its rele-  vant environmental requirements (Lawrence and Lorsch  1967, pp. 3–4). The scale for structural differentiation  captures various aspects of differences across units, such  as different mindsets, time orientations, functions, and  Jansen et al.: Structural Differentiation and Ambidexterity  804 Organization Science 20(4), pp. 797–811, © 2009 INFORMS  product/market domains (Lawrence and Lorsch 1967,  Golden and Ma 2003).  We used two measures for capturing formal and  informal senior team integration: senior team contin-  gency rewards and senior team social integration. Senior  team contingency rewards (  = 0 76) refers to the  extent to which senior management team incentives,  such as bonuses and profit sharing, were tied to over-  all firm performance. We adapted a four-item mea-  sure for contingency rewards from Collins and Clark  (2003). The four-item measure for senior team social  integration (  = 0 73) was adapted from prior studies  (O’Reilly et al. 1989, Smith et al. 1994). It captures  the attraction to senior management members, satis-  faction, and social interaction among team members.  Regarding formal and informal organizational integra-  tion mechanisms, our study adapted existing measures  for cross-functional interfaces and connectedness. Based  on Hage and Aiken (1967) and Gupta and Govindarajan  (2000), cross-functional interfaces ( = 0 72) were mea-  sured through a five-item scale. It captures the extent  to which firms use cross-functional boundary-spanning  integration mechanisms, such as cross-functional teams,  projects, and liaison personnel. Connectedness (  =  0 74) was measured with a four-item scale adapted from  Jaworski and Kohli (1993). It refers to the extent to  which employees were networked to various levels of  the hierarchy in their organization.  An integrated confirmatory factor analysis on all  items pertaining to structural differentiation, formal and  informal integration mechanisms, and exploratory and  exploitative innovation (with each item constrained to  load only on the factor for which it was the proposed  indicator) yielded a model that fitted the data moder-  ately well (   2  /degrees of freedom (d.f.) = 1 65, incre-  mental fit index (IFI) = 0 90, comparative fit index  (CFI) = 0 90, root mean squared error of approxima-  tion (RMSEA) = 0 053). Item loadings were as pro-  posed and significant (p < 0 01). We also performed  three additional confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) in  which we grouped items to get better parameter to  degree of freedom ratios. The first CFA model contained  structural differentiation, exploratory innovation, and  exploitative innovation. The second CFA model grouped  senior team integration mechanisms and included senior  team contingency rewards and senior team social inte-  gration. The third CFA model grouped organizational  integration mechanisms and contained cross-functional  interfaces and connectedness. The fit indices were as  follows: Model 1,    2  /d.f.= 2 18, IFI= 0 93, CFI= 0 93,  RMSEA = 0 072; Model 2,    2  /d.f. = 1 74, IFI = 0 98,  CFI= 0 98, RMSEA= 0 057; Model 3,    2  /d.f.= 2 07,  IFI = 0 95 CFI = 0 94, RMSEA = 0 068. Furthermore,  all factor loadings were significant (p < 0 01). These  additional results confirm the convergent and discrimi-  nant validity of our scales.  Control Variables. In our empirical study, we con-  trolled for possible alternative explanations by includ-  ing relevant control variables. First, because larger orga-  nizations may have more resources yet may lack the  flexibility to achieve ambidexterity, we included the nat-  ural logarithm of the number of full-time employees  within organizations to account for firm size. Second,  it is known that incumbent firms are naturally more  inclined toward exploitative efforts (Gilbert 2005), so we  included firm age measured by natural logarithm of the  number of years from the firm’s founding. Third, senior  team size could affect the heterogeneity of senior teams  and, accordingly, impact the achievement of ambidex-  terity. Following prior studies, we measured senior team  size through the number of senior executives who are  responsible for strategy formulation and implementation  (e.g., Siegel and Hambrick 2005). Fourth, context or  industry effects may influence the extent to which orga-  nizations pursue exploratory and exploitative innovation  (He and Wong 2004, Sidhu et al. 2007). Accordingly,  we included seven industry dummies based on Stan-  dard Industry Classification codes: manufacturing, con-  struction, wholesale, transportation, financial services,  professional services, and other. Fifth, environmental  attributes such as dynamism tend to affect organiza-  tions in pursuing exploratory and exploitative innovation  (Floyd and Lane 2000). We therefore included a three-  item scale for environmental dynamism (  = 0 70) that  tapped into the rate of change and the instability of the  external environment (Jansen et al. 2006).  Analysis and Results  Table 1 presents descriptive statistics and correlations  for the study variables. Table 2 presents the results of  the regression analyses for ambidexterity. To examine  multicollinearity, we calculated variance inflation factors  (VIFs) for each of the regression equations. The max-  imum VIF within the models was 1.43, which is well  below the rule-of-thumb cutoff of 10 (Neter et al. 1990).  The baseline model (Model 1) contains the control  variables. Model 2 includes the effect of structural dif-  ferentiation on ambidexterity. Model 3 adds formal and  informal integration mechanisms as mediators of the for-  mer relationship. Although we explicitly theorize inte-  gration mechanisms as mediating variables, we also ran  moderation tests (adjusted R  2  = 0 22) but found no  significant interaction effects. This further strengthens  our assertions of an intervening effect of integration  mechanisms.  To assess the effects of structural differentiation and  integration on ambidexterity, we followed a four-step  procedure (Baron and Kenny 1986). First, we exam-  ined the relationship between structural differentiation  and ambidexterity. As shown in Model 2, the coeffi-  cient for structural differentiation is positive and signifi-  cant ( = 0 23, p < 0 01).

As shown in Model 3, however, senior  team contingency rewards are not significantly related  to ambidexterity (  = 0 06, n.s.). Senior team social  integration is positively related to ambidexterity (  =  0 15, p < 0 05). The two indicators for organizational  integration mechanisms, cross-functional interfaces ( =  0 15, p < 0 05) and connectedness ( = 0 17, p < 0 01),  are both positively related to achieving ambidexterity.  Third, the significant relationship between structural dif-  ferentiation and ambidexterity needs to become insignif-  icant when the mediating variables are introduced in the  regression model. As shown in Model 3, the relation-  ship between structural differentiation and ambidexterity  becomes insignificant when the four mediating variables  are added ( = 0 11, p > 0 10). Fourth, structural differ-  entiation needs to be significantly related to the medi-  ating variables. We ran additional regression analyses  with the four mediation variables as dependent variables  and structural differentiation as the independent variable  with all control variables included. The regression anal-  yses results indicated that structural differentiation was  significantly related to the mediating variables contin-  gency rewards ( = 0 30, p < 0 001), social integration  Jansen et al.: Structural Differentiation and Ambidexterity  806 Organization Science 20(4), pp. 797–811, © 2009 INFORMS  (  = 0 20, p < 0 01), and cross-functional interfaces  (  = 0 32, p < 0 001), but not connectedness (  =  0 12, n.s.).  Overall, the mediating analysis provides various inter-  esting outcomes. First, it does not provide support for  Hypothesis 1 about the mediating role of senior team  contingency rewards. Although structural differentia-  tion is positively related to senior team contingency  rewards, “common fate” incentive systems appear to  be not related to achieving ambidexterity. Senior team  social integration, however, fully mediates the relation-  ship between structural differentiation and ambidexter-  ity. Our findings support previous assertions concerning  the importance of informal senior team integration in  ambidextrous organizations. Hypothesis 2 is supported.  Second, Hypothesis 3, which proposed a mediating  effect of cross-functional interfaces on the relationship  between structural differentiation and ambidexterity, is  supported. Cross-functional interfaces provide formal  integration mechanisms that contribute to establishing  linkages between exploratory and exploitative organiza-  tional units. Finally, our findings indicate that connected-  ness does not mediate the relationship between structural  differentiation and ambidexterity. Rather, informal social  relations within organizations have a direct effect  on pursuing exploratory and exploitative innovation  simultaneously.  Post Hoc Analysis  To further verify our research findings, we conducted  various additional analyses. First, we used structural  equation modeling to assess the fit of the hypothesized  model and verify the indirect effect of structural dif-  ferentiation on ambidexterity. Given our sample size  of 230, we used item-averaged composite variables as  observed variables (Bagozzi and Yi 1988, Kenny 1979).  We fixed the path from each latent construct to its mea-  sured variable equal the square root of the reliability  coefficient alpha ( ) of the measured composite variable,  and the amount of error was set to (1− ). The result-  ing model fitted the data adequately (IFI= 1 00, CFI=  1 00, standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR)=  0 025). Moreover, findings replicated the results of the  regression analyses. The direct path from structural  differentiation toward ambidexterity was nonsignificant  (p > 0 10). In addition, findings show that senior team  social integration (p < 0 01) and cross-functional inter-  faces (p < 0 01) mediate the relationship between struc-  tural differentiation and ambidexterity. Second, given the  results of the Edwards’s (1994) test as explained ear-  lier (and the insignificant difference between the addi-  tive and multiplicative models), we conducted additional  regression analyses with the multiplicative interaction of  exploratory and exploitative innovation as an alternative  measurement of ambidexterity (Gibson and Birkinshaw  2004, He and Wong 2004). We repeated the tests of  the hypotheses using this alternative measurement as  the dependent variable and found similar results. The  findings regarding the mediating role of senior team  and organizational integration mechanisms replicated the  earlier findings with the additive model as the mea-  surement of ambidexterity. Hypothesis 1 (senior team  contingency rewards) was not supported, Hypothesis 2  was supported (senior team social integration), Hypoth-  esis 3 was supported (cross-functional interfaces), and  Hypothesis 4 was not supported (connectedness). Over-  all, our Post hoc analysis provides strong support for our  research findings.  Discussion and Conclusion  An important stream of studies investigates specific  organizational attributes that influence a firm’s ambidex-  terity, or effectiveness, in pursuing seemingly contra-  dictory activities simultaneously, which is difficult to  achieve in practice (Raisch and Birkinshaw 2008). Con-  ceptual arguments assert that achieving ambidexter-  ity imposes considerable challenges on organizations,  because of the necessity to allow integration and appli-  cation of spatially dispersed exploratory and exploitative  efforts (Smith and Tushman 2005). Yet, our under-  standing of antecedents of ambidexterity remains rather  unclear.  Our study underscores previous assertions that struc-  tural differentiation provides an important yet insuf-  ficient structural attribute for achieving ambidexterity.  Structural differentiation helps organizations to buffer  experimentation and the development of new compe-  tences and capabilities from ongoing operations (e.g.,  Gilbert 2006, Tushman and O’Reilly 1996). It gener-  ates structural flexibility to adapt to local environmental  demands (Volberda 1996), yet exploratory and exploita-  tive activities need to be mobilized, integrated, and  applied across inconsistent organizational units. Accord-  ingly, our study affirms the importance of structural  differentiation within ambidextrous organizations; how-  ever, it suggests that ambidextrous organizations need  to resolve conflicting tensions in senior teams, and to  integrate diverse knowledge sources across differentiated  exploratory and exploitative units (Kogut and Zander  1992, Smith and Tushman 2005). We argue, therefore,  that ambidextrous organizations require a dynamic capa-  bility that enables them to mobilize, coordinate, and  integrate dispersed contradictory efforts, and to allo-  cate, reallocate, combine, and recombine resources and  assets across dispersed exploratory and exploitative units  (O’Reilly and Tushman 2007, Teece 2007). Our findings  move research on the relationship between structural dif-  ferentiation and ambidexterity beyond main effects (e.g.,  Gilbert 2006). We suggest that future research needs  Jansen et al.: Structural Differentiation and Ambidexterity  Organization Science 20(4), pp. 797–811, © 2009 INFORMS 807  to examine distinct integration mechanisms as impor-  tant contenders for the dynamic capability to pursue  exploratory and exploitative innovation simultaneously.  Our study leads us to suggest that the previously asserted  effect of structural differentiation on ambidexterity is  indirect, operating through both informal senior team  integration (i.e., senior team social integration) and  formal organizational integration (i.e., cross-functional  interfaces) mechanisms. In this sense, our study con-  tributes to previous literatures that theorized for the  subsequent integration of differentiated exploratory and  exploitative activities (Siggelkow and Levinthal 2003,  Westerman et al. 2006). Ambidextrous organizations  should enact differentiated exploratory and exploitative  activities by managing resource and routine reconfigu-  ration (Zahra et al. 2006). Our study argues that orga-  nizations are able to create value for both new and  existing customers only when they are able to struc-  ture their technology portfolios and subsequently inte-  grate differentiated activities to capitalize on them. In  finding support for this notion, our study provides new  insights about which specific integration mechanisms  within organizations are required to coordinate, imple-  ment, and apply exploratory and exploitative activi-  ties in dispersed organizational units and to achieve  ambidexterity.  Interestingly though, our study fails to support the  hypothesis that senior team contingency rewards con-  tribute to the achievement of ambidexterity. Although  prior studies have suggested that “common fate” incen-  tive systems reduce interpersonal competition and foster  a firmwide view and collaboration (Edmondson et al.  2003, Wageman 1995), our study shows that they do  not contribute to alleviating potential problems associ-  ated with spatially separating exploratory and exploita-  tive efforts. A possible explanation for the positive but  insignificant relationship could be that the creation of  outcome interdependency through senior team contin-  gency rewards does not encourage senior team members  to reconcile conflicting interests across differentiated  exploratory and exploitative units. In this vein, Wage-  man (1995) showed that task (i.e., stemming from the  process by which the work is carried out) rather than  outcome interdependency resulted in greater coopera-  tion, high-quality group processes, and member satis-  faction. Although group reward systems are known to  stimulate cooperative effort and motivation, this effort  may not necessarily result in balanced decision mak-  ing and managing strategic contradictions in senior  teams (Wageman and Baker 1997, Smith and Tush-  man 2005). Our study hints that overcoming multiple  conflicting strategic agendas and reinforcing integrative  thinking in ambidextrous organizations requires senior  team integrative mechanisms that go beyond establishing  outcome interdependency. Although senior team contin-  gency rewards may be beneficial to achieving ambidex-  terity under certain organizational and industrial condi-  tions (e.g., Jansen et al. 2008, O’Reilly and Tushman  2004), future studies should examine how interdepen-  dency affects the impact of senior team contingency  rewards on the achievement of ambidexterity across spa-  tially dispersed exploratory and exploitative units.  Although our study indicates that common fate incen-  tive systems do not provide necessary integrative value  across differentiated exploratory and exploitative units,  it shows that senior team social integration mediates  the relationship between structural differentiation and  ambidexterity (e.g., O’Reilly and Tushman 2004). Social  integration engenders social mechanisms such as trust  and reciprocity in senior teams (Lubatkin et al. 2006). It  encourages team members to openly discuss and debate  conflicting demands, goals, and aspirations of their asso-  ciated exploratory and exploitative units. Such critical  debate helps to overcome strategic contradictions and  resolve conflicting situations arising from integrating  and implementing spatially dispersed exploratory and  exploitative activities. Our study increases our under-  standing of the importance of senior team social integra-  tion in structurally ambidextrous organizations (Gibson  and Birkinshaw 2004).  Regarding the mediating role of organizational inte-  gration mechanisms, our study contributes to prior lit-  eratures concerning the importance of formal linkages  across differentiated exploratory and exploitative orga-  nizational units in ambidextrous organizations (Gilbert  2006). By providing formal integration devices,  our findings indicate that cross-functional interfaces  are effective integrative mechanisms in differentiated  ambidextrous organizations. Boundary-spanning mech-  anisms contribute to the development of a common  language and ensure the capture, interpretation, and  integration of knowledge sources across differentiated  exploratory and exploitative units (Carlile 2004, De Luca  and Atuahene-Gima 2007). An important feature of  cross-functional interfaces is their ability to deepen  flows of knowledge between exploratory and exploita-  tive units without interrupting their internal processes  (Gilbert 2006). Our study’s finding on the mediating  effect of cross-functional interfaces adds to the emer-  gent dialogue on the hierarchical level at which inte-  gration of exploratory and exploitative efforts need to  happen. It indicates that the idea that differentiated  exploratory and exploitative efforts are integrated at  the senior team level has to be expanded by incor-  porating lower-level cross-functional linkage devices as  well (Gilbert 2006, Westerman et al. 2006). Our study  contributes to these recent conceptual assertions that,  in addition to senior team social integration, formal  organizational integration mechanisms are needed to  Jansen et al.: Structural Differentiation and Ambidexterity  808 Organization Science 20(4), pp. 797–811, © 2009 INFORMS  provide necessary horizontal linkages across differenti-  ated exploratory and exploitative units in ambidextrous  organizations.  Regarding informal social relations, our study reveals  that connectedness does not mediate the relationship  between structural differentiation and ambidexterity, but  rather contributes to achieving ambidexterity directly.  A possible explanation could be that it becomes more  difficult to develop and maintain informal social rela-  tions between organizational members across differ-  entiated exploratory and exploitative units. Given our  finding that senior team social integration fully medi-  ates the relationship between structural differentiation  and ambidexterity, it may be the case that structural dif-  ferentiation is only detrimental to informal social rela-  tions at lower hierarchical levels. Future research should  shed more light on this potential differential impact of  structural differentiation on senior team social integra-  tion and connectedness. Notwithstanding this potential  effect, our study shows that ambidextrous organizations  need to implement more formal organizational inte-  gration devices, such as liaison personnel and teams,  rather than informal social relations to integrate and  apply differentiated exploratory and exploitative efforts  at lower hierarchical levels. As organizational members  with a larger pool of informal relations may be able to  exploit or explore to their advantage (Lin et al. 2007),  our study may also suggest that connectedness con-  tributes to establishing a conducive context for achieving  ambidexterity directly rather than indirectly by generat-  ing resource and knowledge flows across differentiated  units. Specific features of dense social relations, such  as discipline, trust, and support, have been shown to  directly affect the achievement of contextual ambidex-  terity. They encourage organizational members to make  their own judgments as to how to best divide their time  between conflicting demands (Gibson and Birkinshaw  2004). Further exploratory research is necessary to  explore this possibility and understand how connected-  ness enables the achievement of contextual ambidexter-  ity within organizations.  Our study reveals that ambidextrous organizations  should carefully design and implement specific types  of integration mechanisms at different hierarchical lev-  els. At the corporate level, ambidextrous organiza-  tions should encourage (informal) social integration  among senior team members. At lower hierarchi-  cal levels, however, ambidextrous organizations should  establish more formal cross-functional interfaces that  deepen knowledge flows across differentiated units yet  retain the contradictory processes and time orientation  within exploratory and exploitative units. This distinc-  tion echoes prior research stating that as one comes  closer to senior management, integration efforts become  more broad, less clear cut, and more complex in  nature (Egelhoff 1991, Floyd and Lane 2000). At the  senior team level, managers face both high differen-  tiation as well as high interdependency, requiring fre-  quent adjustments and more informal means of inte-  gration (Daft and Lengel 1986, Hambrick et al. 2008).  At lower levels in ambidextrous organizations, orga-  nizational members still face high differentiation but  lower interdependency, calling for more formal integra-  tion mechanisms (Daft and Lengel 1986). Through this  richer explanation and empirical assessment of these  multilevel dynamics in ambidextrous organizations, we  contribute to a greater clarity and better understanding  of how organizations may effectively pursue exploratory  and exploitative innovation simultaneously to achieve  ambidexterity.  Limitations and Future Research Suggestions  Our study presents a first step toward uncovering the  interrelationship between differentiation, integration, and  achieving ambidexterity, and study limitations suggest  the need for additional research. First, future studies  may include additional senior team and organizational  attributes. For instance, previous research has argued  that leadership behaviors such as transformational and  transactional leadership contribute to exploration and  exploitation within an organization (Jansen et al. 2009),  and may also may foster an organizational context suit-  able for hosting contradictory forces (Vera and Crossan  2004). Additionally, future research may capture multi-  ple levels of analysis and uncover how unit-level and  firm-level or firm-level and interfirm-level characteristics  contribute to achieving ambidexterity (see, e.g., Simsek  2009). Second, our study focused on spatially separat-  ing exploratory and exploitative activities in different  organizational units as an important way of achieving  ambidexterity. Organizations may, however, utilize other  structures or systems to reconcile conflicting tensions,  such as temporal separation, a system in which orga-  nizations focus on exploratory innovation at one point  in time followed by a focus on exploitation at subse-  quent points in time (Gupta et al. 2006). Future research  may uncover differential effects of structural attributes  for spatial and temporal separation of exploratory and  exploitative innovation. Third, although we took great  care in separating collection of data on the independent  and dependent variables as well as the use of multiple  respondents that provide valuable methodological con-  tributions, future longitudinal research is necessary to  investigate how structural differentiation and integration  are developed and impacted over time.

ABSTRACT  KEYWORDS: Winter Report, self-regula-  tion, corporate-governance codes, inter-  national standards and regulatory forms,  board disclosure in Europe  Although self-regulation has proven to be effective for the  development of voluntary corporate-governance codes,  the results of this study indicate that leading European  companies are not yet too concerned about compliance  with these codes. While self-regulation appears to be  ineffective to change the disclosure practices of companies,  the study concludes that factors relevant for choosing  regulatory forms and the impact and risks involved with  non-compliance of companies with voluntary codes have  determined the Winter Report’s emphasis on self-  regulation.  INTRODUCTION  Triggered by financial irregularities in the  USA, and partly in response to the extra-  territorial implications of the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act, the European Union (EU) responded in  2002 with the publication of the Winter  Report of the High Level Group of Com-  pany Law Experts.1 One year later, the EU  has initiated a public debate on its corporate  governance Action Plan based on the Winter  Report.2 The report emphasises the import-  ance of voluntary disclosure by boards of  directors to avoid financial scandals and to  boost investor confidence in EU member  states. Although the Winter Report under-  lines the importance of voluntary codes of  conduct, critics seem to be well positioned to  question the effectiveness of these codes on  board behaviour and disclosure.  This paper reviews the introduction of  voluntary codes across Europe as part of a  greater global development by financial  markets to effect changes in the structure  and behaviour of boards of directors. By  analysing the level of board disclosure of  483 listed corporations in 12 countries  (eight EU member states and four non-  EU countries), this paper reviews the  impact of more than ten years of corporate  governance codes across Europe. The  paper concludes that, despite years of  self-regulation, disclosure levels continue to  differ greatly across Europe. In spite of the  limited impact corporate governance codes  seem to have had on board practices, the  small risks associated with non-compliance  seem to justify the role voluntary codes of  conduct play in improving investor con-  fidence.  THE WINTER REPORT  While most media attention was directed at  the introduction of the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act in the USA, Chairman Jaap Winter of  the High Level Group of Company Law  Experts presented a report on a ‘Modern  Regulatory Framework for Company Law  in Europe’ to EU Commissioner Frits  Bolkestein on 4th November, 2002. This  important report for regulators in the EU did  not receive much attention from the media  or from corporate governance experts outside  Europe. This was remarkable, since this  report has been used as the basis for the EU  action plan for corporate governance  published in May 2003.  The Winter Report and the EU action  plan display great confidence in the effec-  tiveness of self-regulation in corporate gov-  ernance to enforce stricter disclosure  Maassen, van den Bosch and Volberda  Page 147  requirements across the EU. More specifi-  cally, the Winter Report states:  ‘Disclosure can be a powerful regulatory  tool: it creates an incentive to comply with  best practice, and allows members and  third parties to take necessary actions.  Disclosure requirements can be more  efficient, more flexible and easier to  enforce.’3  The report reviews a great number of issues  related to the corporate governance practices  of Europe’s leading companies. Through the  use of national voluntary codes of conduct  and the enforcement of standards of conduct  on a ‘comply or explain’ basis at a minimum,  the Winter Report recommends that listed  companies disclose more information on the  role of non-executive and supervisory direc-  tors, management remuneration, the respon-  sibility of management for financial  statements and auditing practices. Table 1  summarises most of the Winter Report’s  recommendations to improve the disclosure  practices of boards of directors of listed  corporations.  SELF-REGULATION AND CORPORATE  GOVERNANCE  The emphasis of the Winter Report on  voluntary disclosure is not new to most  financial markets. Self-regulation has been  favoured by most international financial  markets to develop and implement modern  corporate governance standards. According  to the European Corporate Governance  Institute, more than 107 codes, including  revisions of existing codes, have been  introduced since 1992 in 35 countries.4 In  Europe alone, more than 55 codes have been  introduced in 19 countries.5  The early self-regulation initiatives in the  UK have had a tremendous impact on the  development of corporate governance stan-  dards in other European countries and across  the globe (see Figures 1 and 2).  The globalisation of self-regulation can be  categorised by four distinctive phases: the first  phase, modern code development, began in  the UK with the introduction of the  Cadbury Code in 1992.7  Subsequent to the developments in the  UK, the second phase occurred between  1994 and 1996, dominated by the develop-  ment of codes of best practices mainly in  other Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions; codes that  were heavily influenced by the publication of  the Cadbury Code and the Greenbury  Report.8 In France, however, as one of the  first continental European countries to  develop a code, the 1995 Viénot Report  recommended that directors reduce the  number of cross-directorships and suggested  the appointment of at least two independent  directors to boards of listed corporations;9  soon afterwards, in October 1996, the Cı́rculo  de Empresarios was introduced in Spain.10  During the third phase in the globalisation  of corporate governance standards (1997–  2000), further continental European coun-  tries introduced codes of best practice. These  included the Dutch Peters Report in 1997;  the Belgian Cardon Report in 1998; the  Viénot II Report in 1999; the recent Swiss  Code of Best Practice; and many others.11  Following the Asian financial crisis, voluntary  codes were introduced to financial markets  across the continent, including in Japan with  the Keidanrein Report in 1997; the CII’s  Corporate Governance Code in India in  1999; the Korean Committee on Corporate  Governance in 1999; and the Malaysian  Report on Corporate Governance in  2000.12 In Indonesia, the National Commit-  tee on Corporate Governance published a  draft version of the Indonesian Code of  Good Corporate Governance in 2000, which  was updated in 2001.13  As part of the fourth phase, and mainly  under the influence of the Organisation for  Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD), the United States Agency for  International Development (USAID), the  The importance of disclosure in corporate governance self-regulation across Europe  Page 148  Maassen, van den Bosch and Volberda  Page 149  Table 1: Winter Report: Overview of recommendations  Issue Recommendations of the Winter Report Section  Disclosure The EU, in considering new — and amending existing — regulations or  company law, should carefully consider whether disclosure requirements are  better suited to achieve the desired effects than substantive rules. Any  disclosure requirement should be based on the obligation to provide fair,  relevant and meaningful information.  II.3  New  Technology  Listed companies should be required to maintain and continuously update a  company information section on their websites, and maintain links with  public registers and other relevant authorities.  II.6  Corporate  Governance  Statement  Listed companies should be required to include in their annual report and  accounts a coherent and descriptive statement covering the key elements of  the corporate governance rules and practices to which they apply. This  statement should also be separately posted on the company’s website. Such a  statement should contain a reference to the designated national code of  corporate governance and/or company law rules with which the company  complies or in relation to which it explains deviations.  III.1  Independence Listed companies should be required to disclose in their annual corporate  governance statement which of their directors they consider to be  independent and on what grounds. Similar disclosure should be made  when a new director is proposed for appointment.  III.10  Composition Listed companies should include in their annual corporate governance  statement a profile of the board’s composition, and they should explain why  individual non-executive or supervisory directors are qualified to serve on  the board in their particular roles. Similar disclosure should be made in  proposals for initial appointment.  III.10  Interlocks Listed companies should be required to disclose what board positions in  other companies their non-executive or supervisory directors hold.  III.10  Remuneration The remuneration policy for directors generally should be disclosed in the  financial statements of the company, and should be an explicit item for  debate on the agenda of the annual meeting. The individual remuneration of  directors of the company, both executive and non-executive or supervisory  directors, is to be disclosed in detail in the financial statements of the  company.  Schemes granting shares and share options and other forms of  remuneration of directors linked to the share price should require the  prior approval of the shareholders’ meeting, on the basis of a proper  explanation by the remuneration committee of the applicable rules and of  their likely costs.  The costs of all share-incentive schemes should be properly reflected in  the annual accounts, and this accounting principle should be recognised in a  European framework rule.  III.11  European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development (EBRD) and the International  Finance Corporation (IFC; part of the World  Bank Group), Russia and other eastern  European countries started the development  of corporate-governance standards.15 The  modernisation of corporation laws in the  former Soviet Union began in 1996 with  the enactment of the new Russian Law on  Joint Stock Companies. The Russian  Corporate Governance Code was introduced  in April 2002, four months after the Russian  Federation significantly amended its Law on  Joint Stock Companies.16 In June 2002,  Poland also completed its final draft of the  ‘Corporate Governance Code for Listed  Polish Corporations’; countries in the  Balkans are modernising their company  The importance of disclosure in corporate governance self-regulation across Europe  Page 150  Figure 2: The globalisation of corporate governance standards14  Hampel   and Turnbull   1998/1999   DTI Law    Review   2001   Anglo-Saxon   countries are the   first to follow,   including some   initiatives in   continental   European countries   Phase 2   1994–1996   Cadbury   Code 1992   Greenbury   Report 1995   Phase 1   1992–1993   Phase 3   1997–2000   Phase 4   2001–   The majority of   continental   European countries   and a few countries   in Asia and South   America follow   with the   introduction of   voluntary standards  Developing   countries start to   embark on   corporate   governance through   the development of   legislation and   codes    The first code of   best practices on   corporate   governance   introduced in the   UK    Figure 1: Phases in the globalisation of corporate governance standards6  laws with the assistance of the USA and  the EU.17  Meanwhile, the private sector in the UK  appears to have embarked on a new round of  self-regulatory initiatives with the publication  of the Smith Report on audit committees,  the Higgs Report on the role and effective-  ness of non-executive directors and the  Combined Code on Corporate Governance  in 2003.18 Given the popularity of these  codes, more national codes can be expected  in the near future.  PAN-EUROPEAN CORPORATE  GOVERNANCE CODES  Although Europe witnessed some attempts to  establish pan-European codes of corporate  governance, such as the OECD principles on  corporate governance,19 it appears to be  unlikely that a pan-European code will be  introduced by the EU, in line with the  recommendations of the Winter Report.  According to the drafters of the Winter  Report:  ‘The adoption of such a code would not  achieve full information for investors  about the key corporate governance rules  applicable to companies across Europe, as  these rules would still be based on and part  of national company laws that are in  certain aspects widely divergent. We also  doubted whether additional Europe-wide  voluntary rules would contribute to the  improvement of corporate governance, as  Europe would either have to allow many  alternative rules, depending on the various  company law systems, or to confine itself  to abstract, and perhaps largely mean-  ingless, rules which would be compatible  with all of these systems.’20  DETERMINANTS OF EFFECTIVE  VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE  The confidence of the Winter Report in  disciplining markets with voluntary disclo-  sure is not shared by all academics and market  observers who have been reporting on  deficiencies of capital markets’ protection of  shareholders. Cuervo pleads for fewer codes  of corporate governance and more market  control.21 These authors believe that the  absence of an effective corporate-control  market that disciplines controlling share-  holders; the weakness of institutional inves-  tors;22 and the widespread adoption of  managerial defence mechanisms23 are major  barriers preventing minority shareholders  from exercising their rights.  Besides these market constraints, criticism  is also directed at the effectiveness of self-  regulation as a mechanism to set and enforce  corporate governance standards. Whittington  indicates that self-regulation has an enforce-  ment problem when new standards conflict  with the interests of parties involved.24 As  stated more profoundly by Finch:  ‘Self-regulatory structures are prone to a  number of criticisms — that, for instance,  they favour the regulated group and  ignore the broader public interest; they  are designed with large, well-organised,  well-resourced enterprises in mind and fail  to deal with those who really need to be  regulated; their procedures tend to exclude  third parties; they are low on account-  ability; they have anti-competitive effects;  they tend not to enjoy public confidence;  and their investigative, enforcement and  sanctioning processes tend to be weak.’25  The criticism related to the effectiveness of  self-regulation in corporate governance has  not been well supported by the limited  number of studies on the impact of voluntary  codes of conduct on the corporate govern-  ance practices of corporations. The authors of  this paper could find only a few impact  assessments and monitoring reports on the  implementation of voluntary codes.26 But  more troublesome for proponents of  voluntary corporate governance standards  seems to be the inconclusive evidence on  Maassen, van den Bosch and Volberda  Page 151  the relationship between the implementation  of corporate governance standards and the  performance of corporations. Interestingly,  there appears to be an increasing awareness  that the conventional corporate governance  interventions proposed by most corporate  governance codes are not necessarily posi-  tively associated with the performance of  corporations.27  As an example, most corporate governance  codes promote the independence of boards  of directors. Not only do the definitions of  independent boards vary widely; a positive  relationship with the performance of cor-  porations is difficult to claim. To illustrate  this, Bhagat and Black state:  ‘At the very least there is no convincing  evidence that increasing board indepen-  dence, relative to the norms that currently  prevail among large American firms, will  improve firm performance. And there is  some evidence suggesting the opposite —  that firms with supermajority-independent  boards perform worse than other firms,  and that firms with more inside than  independent directors perform about as  well as firms with majority- (but not  supermajority-) independent boards.’28  RESEARCH APPROACH  This study has not attempted to measure the  relationship between the implementation of  corporate governance standards and the  financial performance of corporations. Nor  has it measured the impact on shareholder  confidence of specific voluntary corporate  governance codes in particular countries.  Instead, this study reviewed the quantity of  information companies disclosed about their  boards of directors in their 2001 annual  reports. Its authors reviewed a total of 483  annual reports of listed companies in 12  European countries (see Table 2). In par-  ticular, the study collected basic information  on the number of board meetings, the  composition of the board of directors, the  use of board committees and the leadership  structure of the board. In addition, the  authors reviewed the amount of information  disclosed on the remuneration and demo-  graphic information of 4,995 individual  directors occupying a total of 6,093 board  positions in the companies surveyed. A  majority, 305 companies (63 per cent), have  a one-tier board. The remaining 178 com-  panies (37 per cent) have a board of directors  based on a two-tier structure (see Table 3).  FINDINGS  This study examined the disclosure of  information on board demographics and the  tenure of directors (see Table 4). Few  companies (28.8 per cent) disclose the  nationality of their directors. Less than half  of the total number of directors have their  tenure with the company disclosed (49.5 per  cent). Age is disclosed for 62.7 per cent of  directors. Of the data examined, the gender  of directors is most often indicated in annual  reports (98.5 per cent).  Companies also seemed to resist disclosing  the number of meetings their boards of  directors had held in 2001 (see Table 5); one-  third of the companies (33.3 per cent) did not  The importance of disclosure in corporate governance self-regulation across Europe  Page 152  Table 2: Number of companies  Country  Number of  companies  Percentage of  total  Belgium 20 4.1  Czech Republic 16 3.3  France 39 8.1  Germany 30 6.2  Italy 27 5.6  Netherlands 100 20.7  Poland 14 2.9  Russia 10 2.1  Spain 31 6.4  Sweden 21 4.3  Switzerland 25 5.2  United Kingdom 150 31.1  Total: 483 100.0  Maassen, van den Bosch and Volberda  Page 153  Table 3: Number of directors and their positions in boards  Countries Directors Positions Companies  12 Males: 4,637 Executive: 1,883 One-Tier Boards: 305  Females: 270 Non-Executive: 4,122 Two-Tier Boards: 178  Unknown: 88 Unknown: 88  Total: 4,995 Total: 6,093 Total: 483  Table 4: Disclosure of demographics and tenure  Country  Number of  positions  Disclosure of  nationality  Disclosure of  gender  Disclosure of  age  Disclosure of  tenure  Belgium 271 59 21.8% 264 97.4% 145 53.5% 98 36.2%  Czech Republic 221 190 86.0 221 100.0 102 46.2 63 28.5  France 603 172 28.5 594 98.5 420 69.7 279 46.3  Germany 733 47 6.4 732 99.9 300 40.9 226 30.8  Italy 384 4 1.0 372 96.9 34 8.9 7 1.8  Netherlands 896 711 79.4 844 94.2 803 89.6 571 63.7  Poland 200 130 65.0 200 100.0 13 6.5 9 4.5  Russia 226 212 93.8 223 98.7 44 19.5 24 10.6  Spain 453 8 1.8 452 99.8 38 8.4 80 17.7  Sweden 256 18 7.0 254 99.2 203 79.3 185 72.3  Switzerland 224 76 33.9 224 100.0 120 53.6 52 23.2  United Kingdom 1,626 129 7.9 1,623 99.8 1,600 98.4 1,419 87.3  Total: 6,093 1,756 28.8% 6,003 98.5% 3,822 62.7% 3,013 49.5%  Table 5: Disclosure of board committees and board meetings  Country  Number of  companies  Number of  committees  Number of  positions  Disclosure of  committee  meetings  Disclosure of  board  meetings  Belgium 20 53 271 22 41.5% 19 95.0%  Czech Republic 16 17 221 0 0.0 1 6.3  France 39 100 603 70 70.0 28 71.8  Germany 30 86 733 49 57.0 28 93.3  Italy 27 53 384 17 32.1 14 51.9  Netherlands 100 163 896 52 31.9 83 83.0  Poland 14 14 200 0 0.0 0 0.0  Russia 10 14 226 0 0.0 1 10.0  Spain 31 87 453 32 36.8 21 67.7  Sweden 21 39 256 9 23.1 17 81.0  Switzerland 25 63 224 5 7.9 10 40.0  United Kingdom 150 574 1,626 179 31.2 100 66.7  Total: 483 1,263 6,093 435 25.5% 322 66.7%  disclose the number of board meetings. Most  of the companies surveyed in Belgium did  disclose information about the number of  board meetings held (95 per cent). One-  fourth of the companies (25.5 per cent)  disclosed the number of meetings of board  committees. French companies were leaders  in disclosing information about these meet-  ings (70 per cent).  The disclosure of the individual remunera-  tion of non-executive directors, as opposed  to total remuneration of the entire board, is  most frequently observed in the UK, Italy,  France and the Netherlands. Although the  first steps have been made by companies in  other countries, individual remuneration of  non-executive directors is disclosed for just  31.6 per cent of the directors in the study.  The individual remuneration of independent  non-executive directors is on average more  often disclosed than for other non-executive  directors (see Table 6).  The disclosure of the individual remunera-  tion of executive directors is again most  frequently observed in the UK, Italy, France  and the Netherlands. The individual remu-  neration of executive directors is disclosed for  44 per cent of the directors in the study. The  individual remuneration of chief executive  officers is on average more often disclosed  than that of other executive directors (see  Table 7).  Across Europe, the independence of non-  executive directors is disclosed by less than  one-third of the companies reviewed (32.9  per cent), including directors who have been  classified as non-independent in annual  reports. The greatest level of disclosure of  the independence of directors is found in the  UK, Belgium, Italy and France. This study  could not find any indication of the  disclosure of the independence of non-  executive directors in the Czech Republic,  Germany, Poland or Russia (see Table 8).

This raises the  intriguing question of why the ‘High Level  Group of Company Law Experts’ responsible  for drafting the Winter Report emphasised  the effectiveness of self-regulation and dis-  closure. Why do these experts leave the  development of corporate governance stan-  dards for boards of directors in the EU to the  market? Why do they emphasise self-regula-  tion, when self-regulatory structures are  criticised and evidence on the impact of  self-regulation is limited?

FACTORS RELEVANT FOR CHOOSING  REGULATORY FORMS  Two main factors, among others, seem to be  relevant for choosing regulatory forms or  government interventions through legislation  to improve the corporate governance stan-  dards of listed companies: the nature of the  corporate governance problems and the risks  associated with these problems.29 By under-  standing the nature of corporate governance  problems, policy makers can assess the need  to regulate corporate governance risks  through legislation or by using voluntary  standards. By making a risk assessment of  corporate governance problems; the par-  ticular impact that the corporate governance  practices of companies can have on society at  large; the significance of the impact; and the  frequency with which the problems (can)  occur, regulators can determine what kind of  regulatory form is most desirable. For ex-  ample, in EU member states the operations  of nuclear power plants are strictly regulated  by legislation. Although the likelihood of a  nuclear accident is limited, the potential  impact and the risks associated with a nuclear  accident are great. Voluntary codes alone  cannot be used to ensure that electricity  producers adhere to strict safety standards,  since the potential impact and the risks  associated with malfunctions of nuclear  power plants are simply too great not to  regulate through legislation.

Conversely, if  there is a high risk of a particular event  occurring, and significant impacts on a  national scale are likely — for example,  widespread outbreaks of disease or plane  crashes if minimum standards are not  followed — then governments may  choose to intervene to ensure standards  are enforced.’30  The relationship between risks and regula-  tory forms is illustrated in Figure 3.  CONCLUSIONS  The relationship between corporate govern-  ance risks and regulatory forms appears to be  well understood by the drafters of the Winter  Report. As suggested by Figure 3, corporate  failures such as Enron can be avoided only  when companies are forced to comply with  legislation. The great risks and impact these  corporate failures have on the confidence of  investors can justify the development of more  stringent corporate legislation, such as the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act. On the other hand, the  impact of companies not complying with  voluntary corporate governance codes seems  not to justify more company legislation in  many EU member states. Indeed, the con-  troversial findings on the impact of corporate  governance standards on the financial per-  formance of corporations and the absence of  quantifiable data seem to support the Winter  Report’s approach: to refrain from further  legislative intervention. In fact, the Winter  Report clearly states that the market is the  right place to enforce compliance with  standards propagated by most voluntary  corporate governance codes. The risks  associated with non-compliance with  voluntary corporate governance codes are  too small to justify further legislation.  Given the results of this study, a great  majority of Europe’s leading companies are  not yet too concerned about non-compli-  ance with voluntary codes and apparently  also do not understand the competitive  advantages of setting greater corporate gov-  ernance standards. Only a minority of leading  companies has discovered compliance to be a  valuable tool to improve reputation, to  increase the value of a company’s assets and  to improve investor perception.  Judgments must be made by each  company to assess the risks associated with  non-compliance with voluntary corporate  governance codes and the impact such  behaviour might have on the company’s  reputation within the investment com-  munity. Compliance with legislation does  not by itself lead to a competitive advantage,  since all companies in the EU are expected to  do so. Compliance with voluntary corporate  governance codes, however, can be a  competitive advantage. The recommenda-  tions of the Winter Report and the EU  corporate governance action plan give Eur-  opean companies this choice.

MARC BAAIJ, Erasmus University, Rotterdam  FRANS VAN DEN BOSCH, Erasmus University, Rotterdam  HENK VOLBERDA, Erasmus University, Rotterdam  Empirical research reveals that relocations of cor-  porate centres are most times confined to national  borders. Until now, cross-border relocations are  almost absent in the European Union, while in the  United States relocations across State borders  appear to be common. To contribute to a managerial  understanding of these phenomena, we propose a  conceptual framework of the determinants of the  corporate centre location. Based on our analysis, we  predict the stickiness of corporate centres of Euro-  pean Union-based corporations will diminish due  to the European Union integration process and in  particular triggered by the expected EU legislation  regarding the removal of legal barriers against cor-  porate mobility.    2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Keywords: Corporate centres, Multinational cor-  porations, Corporate mobility, Multibusiness cor-  porations  Introduction  Multinational corporations have not only expanded  their international sales but have also transferred  functions abroad, first low-added value activities  such as assembly, but increasingly also activities with  higher added value like IT and research and develop-  ment. Service industries go global by migrating high-  European Management Journal Vol. 22, No. 2, pp. 141–149, April 2004 141  wage professional jobs to low-cost countries  (Financial Times, 2003). The increasing geographic dis-  persion of sales, assets, and people, as reflected,  among others, in the studies of the TransNationality  Index (UNCTAD) also suggest that cross-border cor-  porate mobility is on the rise. These developments  raise the question: Are corporate centres as mobile as  the before-mentioned corporate functions or are they  stickier and stay ‘at home’?  Understanding corporate centre mobility is  important as the location of the centre holds rel-  evance for both corporations and host states. ‘The  more competition becomes global, ironically, the  more important the home base becomes’ (Porter,  1990, p. 614). First, we should make clear how we  define the corporate centre in this paper and how it  distinguishes from related concepts like a corpor-  ation’s home base and the corporate parent. Accord-  ing to Porter ‘the home base is where strategy is set,  core product and process development takes place,  and the essential and proprietary skills reside’  (Porter, 1990, p. 69). Porter focuses both on the head-  quarter, and essential, corporate activities. Goold et  al. (1994) describe the corporate parent as: ‘The par-  ent organization includes only those people who  work at levels above or outside the business units,  whether in the corporate centre, or at divisional,  group, sector, or country levels’ (Goold et al., 1994,  p. 40). In comparison to these definitions, we restrict  CORPORATE CENTRES  ourselves to the physical corporate centre as a part  of the home base or corporate parent.  The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we intend  to investigate empirically whether multinational cor-  porations actually transfer their corporate centre  across boundaries of countries, States or metropoles.  Second, based on the literature, we will develop a  conceptual framework of the determinants of corpor-  ate centre location to contribute to the explanation of  the empirical findings and, based on that, reflect on  future developments.  This paper is organized into four sections. In the first,  we investigate previous country studies on corporate  centre mobility. In the second section, we present the  results of our investigation into the corporate centre  relocations of the Fortune Global 500 corporations. In  the third section, we propose a conceptual frame-  work to investigate corporate centre locations. In the  final section, we draw conclusions and discuss the  implications of this paper.  Previous Evidence of Cross-State  Relocations of US Corporations  Most previous studies about corporate centre  locations investigate the development of the spatial  distribution of corporate centres across cities within  a particular country. The majority of those studies  deal with the United States and focus on the largest  corporations (often the Fortune 500). Much of this  research was motivated by a model proposed by  Semple and Phipps (1982). Their four-stage model  indicated that as development takes place, the spatial  concentration of corporate headquarters will  increase, as one metropolitan centre will emerge as  nationally dominant. The second stage is charac-  terized by a small number of dominant regional  metropolitan centres. In the third stage, these cities  have grown regionally mature and compete success-  fully with the national metropolis. In the fourth stage,  all regions are equally mature and there exists no  dominance. Corporate centres are spatially dispersed  over all regions.  Corporate growth and decline explained about two  thirds of the changes in number of corporate centres  per metropole in the United States. Direct relocations  of corporate centres accounted for about ten per cent  (Klier and Testa, 2002; Holloway and Wheeler, 1991)  while mergers and acquisitions contributed about 23  per cent (Holloway and Wheeler, 1991). Figure 1  shows for three US metropoles the percentage of cor-  porate centres that left the metropoles due to mergers  and acquisitions, and the percentage of corporate  centres that left for other reasons (direct relocations)  between 1990 and 2000.  Common finding is a high degree of concentration  European Management Journal Vol. 22, No. 2, pp. 141–149, April 2004142  Figure 1 Percentages of Corporate Centres that left  San Francisco, Chicago and New York, 1990–2000  Note: the percentages are based on the 1990-populations of cor-  porate centres in each metropole. Source: Klier and Testa, 2002  among corporate centres (Klier and Testa, 2002). The  concentration of corporate centres is quite similar  across industry sectors. Exceptions are hi-tech manu-  facturing and the ‘FIRE’ sector (Finance, Insurance,  and Real Estate). High-tech manufacturing is signifi-  cantly more concentrated. High-tech industries have  a tendency to cluster and the corporations within  these industries are not inclined to spatially separate  their corporate centre activities from their R&D or  production plants (Malecki, 1980). In banking, regu-  latory changes have led to a consolidation of the  industry and the growth of corporations. Larger cor-  porations tend to prefer corporate centres in larger  metropolitan areas (Klier and Testa, 2002).  Several researchers (e.g. Semple, 1973; Wheeler, 1985;  Holloway and Wheeler, 1991) observe a tendency to  greater geographic dispersion of corporate centres.  Research reveals a pattern of deconcentration of cor-  porate centres from the large metropolitan areas in  the North East to a more dispersed spatial pattern.  The largest cities worldwide, in particular Chicago,  London, and New York, have been losing corporate  centres for decades (Sassen, 2001). For example, New  York has witnessed a declining number of corporate  centres since the 1950s. In 1955, the New York metro-  politan area hosted 31 per cent of all Fortune 500 cor-  porate centres. By 1999, New York’s share had fallen  to ten per cent (Horst and Koropeckyi, 2000). For the  1955 to 1977 period, the chief beneficiaries were other  large metropolitan centres with infrastructures large  enough to be attractive to corporations. Centres that  first benefited from the decline of New York declined  in the 1980s themselves: Los Angeles and Houston  (Holloway and Wheeler, 1991). A shift is observed  from the very large metropoles to mid-sized metro-  politan areas (Klier and Testa, 2002). There is also evi-  dence of a decrease in Fortune 500 corporate centres  in non-metropolitan counties (Horst and Koropeckyi,  2000). The above-mentioned studies about relo-  cations of corporate centres between metropoles sug-  gest an influence of metropole-specific advantages on  these relocations.  CORPORATE CENTRES  Relocations of Fortune Global 500  Corporations: 1994–2002  As stated before, previous US studies focused on the  Fortune US 500. In line with these studies we chose  the Fortune Global 500 corporations as our research  population to understand the mobility of corporate  centres worldwide. Our research consisted of an  analysis of the Fortune Global 500 lists from 1994 to  2002 and of the publicly available data on these cor-  porations (including previous academic research,  company data, and other secondary data). We start  with the year 1994 because this is the first year a com-  bined list of manufacturing corporations and service  corporations was compiled. We will focus on corpor-  ate centre locations by metropolitan area. Our find-  ings are, therefore, not affected by relocations from  a central city to a suburban location within the same  metropolitan area, or vice versa. Our Fortune Global  500 research revealed 19 relocations of corporate  headquarters across metropolitan areas during the  1994–2002 period. Figure 2 shows the relocations cat-  egorized into three groups: first, relocations between  metropoles within the same nation and within the  same State (US); second, relocations between metro-  poles within different States of the US; and third,  relocations between nations. Furthermore, a distinc-  tion is made between direct relocations and relo-  cations due to mergers and acquisitions.  As Figure 2 shows, only one relocation was across a  national border. This relocation was the result of the  1998 merger between German-based Daimler and  US-based Chrysler. Daimler’s corporate centre is in  Stuttgart, Germany. Before the merger, Chrysler’s  corporate centre was located in Highland Park,  Michigan, USA. The merged corporation, Daimler-  Chrysler, is headquartered in Daimler’s corporate  centre in Stuttgart.  Nine out of the 19 relocations, or 42 per cent, con-  cerned mergers and acquisitions. In the case of acqui-  sitions we found that in most cases the corporate  Figure 2 Fortune Global 500 Corporate Centre Relo-  cations, 1994–2002.

The Conceptual Framework  Determining the Location of the Corporate Centre  In the previous section we empirically investigated  corporate centre mobility. To improve our under-  standing of the empirical findings, in this section we  will suggest a framework of the determinants of the  location of the corporate centre. In line with Forsgren  et al. (1995) we recognize there is no simple relation-  ship between internationalization and the location of  the corporate centre. We argue there is an interplay  of determinants at stake. In this paper we propose to  distinguish four categories of determinants: (a)  company-specific determinants, (b) industry-specific  determinants, (c) metropolitan-specific determinants,  and (d) nation-specific and region-specific determi-  nants. Figure 3 displays the conceptual framework.  Company-Specific Determinants  Parenting Styles  For the multibusiness company three different par-  enting styles can be identified (Goold et al., 1994).  Each style represents a different planning and control  influence of the corporate parent. Planning influence  refers to the role of the parent with respect to the  formulation of plans, strategies and budgets in the  businesses, ranging from low influence (highly  decentralized) to high influence (much more closely  involved and influential) (Goold et al., 1994). Control  influence refers to the role of the parent in control  processes (Goold et al., 1994).  Parents with a strategic planning style are closely  involved with their businesses in the formulation of  plans and decisions. The control process stresses the  long-term health and development of the businesses  while short-term monitoring is de-emphasized. In the  strategic control style, the parent basically decentral-  ized planning to the businesses, but retains a role in  checking and assessing what the businesses propose.  The strategic control parent emphasizes financial  objectives in the control process, but also pays atten-  tion to strategic objectives. The financial control style  is marked by a strong commitment to decentraliz-  ation of planning. The control process concentrates  on financial objectives and the parent monitors actual  results closely and frequently.  In this paper we argue that these parenting styles can  be associated with corporate centre location require-  ments (see Table 1). The strategic planning style as a  ‘hands-on’ style implies a relatively close interaction  between corporate parent and the businesses regard-  ing the planning of the businesses. This close inter-  CORPORATE CENTRES  Figure 3 The Conceptual Framework: Key Determinants of Corporate Centre Location  Table 1 Parenting Styles and Proximity Requirements of the Corporate Centre  Parenting stylea Required proximity of corporate centre to Required proximity of corporate centre  businesses to financial centre  Strategic planning High Low  Strategic control Medium Medium  Financial control Low High  aGoold et al. (1994)  action with respect to the formulation of plans and  decisions will benefit from proximity of the corporate  centre to the businesses. Corporate centres using a  strategic planning style should, therefore, preferably  be located near the businesses. In contrast, the finan-  cial control style is a ‘hands-off’ style while the cor-  porate parent has decentralized the planning to the  businesses. Because there is no need for close  involvement in the formulation of plans and  decisions, there will be less need for the corporate  centre to be located near the businesses. Instead, a  corporate centre using the financial control style may  prefer proximity to the financial community. The  strategic control style parent occupies a position in-  between strategic planning and financial control. The  need of the strategic control style corporate centre to  be located near the businesses is weaker than in the  case of the strategic planning style but stronger than  the financial control style.  European Management Journal Vol. 22, No. 2, pp. 141–149, April 2004144  Legacy  Besides the parenting styles, we distinguish a second  company-specific determinant that influences the  location of the corporate centre: legacy (see Figure 3).  Established companies cannot start with a clean sheet  because they have made commitments in the past  that have resulted in path dependencies.  Path dependencies apply to the corporate resource  and capabilities in general. It also applies to the cor-  porate centre specifically. Corporate centres are  ‘people-businesses’. Relocating a centre implies mov-  ing employees, at least the core staff. In the case of a  cross-national relocation employees need to emigrate  permanently. This is not like the temporary transfer  of the ‘expat’. Relocating employees may be expens-  ive, as the corporation needs to compensate costs and  inconveniences. Relocating manufacturing abroad  does not involve the relocation of people to the same  CORPORATE CENTRES  degree as corporate centre relocation. Actually, the  high costs of labour in the original country was the  reason to relocate manufacturing to lower wage  countries. Besides the employees existing social net-  works between the corporate centre and key stake-  holders like suppliers, customers, regulatory agenc-  ies, and the government create path dependencies.  These path dependencies may hinder a corporate  centre relocation or at least raise the costs of such  an operation.  However, legacy may also stimulate a corporate  centre relocation as the following example illustrates.  Multibusiness firms are usually founded as a  monobusiness. Over time these firms broaden their  portfolios by adding businesses. Often the corporate  centre will still be located at the site of the oldest  business. If the new businesses are spatially separ-  ated from the first business, the strategic planning or  strategic control style corporate centre might benefit  from a new location central to all businesses, instead  of close to the oldest business and at a distance to  the rest of the portfolio. A corporate centre using a  financial control style might prefer a relocation to a  financial centre. Boeing and Royal Philips Electronics  are two examples of companies in our Fortune Global  500 research that relocated their corporate centres to  increase the distance between the corporate centre  and the original business. In 2001, after 86 years Boe-  ing left its city of foundation, Seattle, for Chicago. In  1997, Royal Philips Electronics moved after 106 years  out of Eindhoven, the Dutch city where the company  was founded, to the Dutch capital Amsterdam. Cor-  porate centre relocation may enable the company to  escape from the constraints and sentimental ties of  the original company town:  Philips said it wanted to be closer to investors and to Schi-  phol airport. The Philips move pointed to three reasons  companies move their head office: to be closer to the fin-  ancial markets, to establish greater international presence,  and to escape the parochial constraints of a company town  (Financial Times, 23 March 2001, p. 23).  Industry-specific Determinants  Integration and Differentiation Advantages  Most of the literature in international management  refers to the continuum of integration/coordination/  globalization advantages versus differentiation/  responsiveness/localization advantages (Harzing,  2000). The relative sizes of these two categories of  advantages within an industry suggest the appropri-  ate internationalization strategy for multinational  companies operating in that industry. Bartlett and  Ghoshal (1989) distinguish between four different  internationalization strategies: international, multi-  domestic, global, and transnational. Different inter-  nationalization strategies hold different implications  for the degree of dependence of the subsidiaries on  the corporate centre (Harzing, 2000). In this paper we  argue that this dependence can be associated with  corporate centre location requirements (see Table 2).  European Management Journal Vol. 22, No. 2, pp. 141–149, April 2004 145  The multidomestic corporation is characterized by a  low degree of dependence of the subsidiaries on the  corporate centre. We propose that the required prox-  imity of the corporate centre to the businesses is  accordingly low. The global corporation is associated  with a high degree of dependence. As a consequence,  we argue that the required proximity of the corporate  centre to the businesses is high. Regarding the  required proximity, we position the international and  transnational corporations between the multidomes-  tic and the global corporations.  Industry Clusters  Porter (1990) argues that proximity to industry clus-  ters of competitors, customers, factors of productions,  and supporting and related industries contributes to  the creation of competitive advantage. The signifi-  cantly higher concentration of corporate centres in  the high-tech manufacturing sector compared to  other sectors in the United States (Klier and Testa,  2002) may reflect the importance of clustering.  The relocation of Pharmacia & Upjohn from London  to New Jersey in 1999 illustrates the importance of  industry clusters. In 1995 Pharmacia of Sweden and  the US-based Upjohn merged into Pharmacia &  Upjohn and established their headquarters in Lon-  don, the United Kingdom. In 1999, the CEO at that  time, Mr Hassan, convinced the board to move the  headquarters from the United Kingdom to the United  States, the most profitable prescription-drug market.  The company settled in New Jersey, which is the  centre of activity for the drug industry. In 2003 Phar-  macia & Upjohn was acquired by Pfizer. The corpor-  ate centre was relocated to the corporate centre of  Pfizer in New York. The relocation after the acqui-  sition to the Pfizer corporate centre in New York  illustrates the influence of acquisitions on corporate  centre location.  Metropole-specific Determinants  As corporate centres employ high-skilled pro-  fessionals and managers, the availability of a highly  educated workforce is an important consideration.  As corporate management boards are internationalis-  ing (Heijltjes et al., 2003), the quality of living in the  metropolis becomes an important factor. Cosmopoli-  tan metropoles with major quality hotels and res-  taurants, quality housing, international schools and a  rich cultural life and recreation do have an advan-  tage. Safety, health factors, personal tax and cost of  living are factors that influence the location decision.  Infrastructure is another site selection criterion. Cor-  porate centres need an infrastructure for travel (air,  rail, road transport) and communication (IT and  telecommunications). Traffic congestion plays a role.  Proximity to an international airport is also a con-  sideration.  As Mr Dunham, Chairman and CEO at that time of  CORPORATE CENTRES  Table 2 Integration and Differentiation Advantages and Proximity Requirements of Corporate Centres  Integration Differentiation Internationalisation Corporate centre- Required proximity between  advantages Advantages strategya dependence of corporate centre and  subsidiariesb subsidiary  Low High Multidomestic Low Low  Low Low International Medium Medium  High High Transnational Medium Medium  High Low Global High High  aTypology of internationalisation strategies: Bartlett and Ghoshal (1989)  bTypology of corporate centre-dependences: adapted from Harzing (2000)  Conoco, pointed out in the context of the intended  merger with Phillips Petroleum: ‘Another reason  why we chose Houston — it is a transportation hub.  It has a great international airport. You can fly  directly from Houston to many of the world’s capi-  tals without changing planes. That’s critically  important, because on any given day we have 700  Conoco employees in the air — and I’m sure it’s the  same for Phillips.’ (Financial Times, 3 December 2001,  p. 31).  Corporate centres demand ready access to high-level  business services like, for instance, accounting, legal,  advertising and management consulting (Klier and  Testa, 2002). The proximity of such specialized ser-  vice companies influences the location decision. It  goes without saying that the availability of represen-  tative offices or availability of land for building new  offices is important, as are the costs of office space.  Presence of other major corporate centres is  important too. Companies find it advantageous to  locate near others of their ilk (Klier and Testa, 2002).  Nation- and Region-specific  Determinants  As pointed out before, industry clusters influence  corporate centre location. Industry clusters are part  of the diamond of national advantage (Porter, 1990).  The diamond framework may also apply to the state  level or the supranational level (Van Den Bosch and  Van Prooijen, 1992). Governments at the national, the  State, or the supranational level, can influence the  determinants of the diamond. For instance, govern-  ments may enhance factor conditions by investing in  the knowledge infrastructure, that is, schools, univer-  sities, government-supported technical institutes and  training centres (Porter, 1990). Furthermore, govern-  ments may enhance factor conditions by improving  the functioning of labor markets and capital markets.  Taxation also influences corporate centre location. In  1997 two Fortune Global 500 companies, Nissho Iwai  and Obayashi, relocated from Osaka to Tokyo  because of the 1995 Osaka earthquake and a tax raise  in the Osaka region. ‘Infineon, the Germany chip  European Management Journal Vol. 22, No. 2, pp. 141–149, April 2004146  maker, favours shifting its corporate headquarters to  Switzerland if Gerhard Schröder and his reformist  government press ahead with controversial tax  reforms’ (Financial Times, 28 April 2003).  Corporate governance system may influence corpor-  ate centre location as well. The functioning of direct  monitoring, executive compensation and the market  for corporate control influence the attractiveness of a  country or state as a host for a corporate centre. Pro-  posed corporate governance reforms in The Nether-  lands, in particular regarding executive compen-  sation, is said to have led to discussions within Dutch  boards about relocating the corporate centre abroad  (Het Financieele Dagblad, 15 August 2003, p. 1).  The location of the corporate centre will also be  influenced by legislation. For example, company  legislation and labour legislation will determine in  part the attractiveness of a nation or a region, like  the European Union, as the host of a corporate centre.  Differences in legislation between nations or regions  may stimulate relocations of corporate centres. How-  ever, legislation at the national level, for instance  within the European Union, may also be a barrier to  relocation, as will be pointed out below.  Present EU Legislation regarding Corporate  Mobility  Legislation, especially regarding company laws,  plays a crucial role in cross-border corporate centre  mobility. Legal barriers may inhibit the mobility of  corporate centres across borders. In the United States  corporate centres relocate across States. In the Euro-  pean Union the situation is quite different. Despite  the fact that business leaders have repeatedly, most  recently in the consultation organized by the High  Level Group of Company Law Experts, called for  companies to be able to transfer their ‘seat’ (their  centre of activities and/of their registered office)  within the European Union, there appears to be  ‘insurmountable legal obstacles to such cross-border  transfers’ (European Commission, 2003a). In the  absence of EU legislation governing the cross-border  transfer of seat, these relocations of corporate centres  are currently impossible or at least contingent on  CORPORATE CENTRES  complicated legal arrangements. At present, member  State laws do not provide the necessary means and,  when a transfer is possible by virtue of simul-  taneously applying national laws, frequently conflicts  arise between those laws because of the different con-  necting criteria applied in the Member States. As the  European Commission pointed out in a Communi-  cation: ‘A legislative effort is needed in this field in  order to implement the freedom of establishment in  the manner intended by the Treaty’ (European Com-  mission, 2003b).  Discussion  Our research and previous country studies (e.g. Klier  and Testa, 2002; Holloway and Wheeler, 1991)  revealed corporate centre relocations within nation-  states and between US States. However, relocations  across national borders were found to be relatively  scarce. Corporate centres do relocate but most times  not internationally. Why do corporate centres seem  to be sticky and stay at home? Our conceptual frame-  work of the determinants of corporate centre location  may contribute to answering this important question:  one or several determinants may inhibit cross-border  relocations. For example, the ‘ stickiness’ of corporate  centres may be the result of company-specific deter-  minants. The legacy, that is, path dependencies may  explain why corporate centres stay at home. Further-  more, industry-specific and metropole-specific deter-  minants may provide an explanation why corporate  centres do not relocate. Corporate centres that are  already located in a metropole with many advan-  tages are less inclined to relocate. Nation- and region-  specific determinants may contribute to explaining  the stickiness of corporate centres. In particular, com-  pany legislation may inhibit relocation across  nations. In the European Union the legal barriers to  cross-border relocation of corporate centres are up till  now perceived as ‘insurmountable.’ The impact of  this last determinant may change in the near future.  The European Commission intends to present in the  short term (2004) a proposal for a ‘Fourteenth Com-  pany Law Directive on Transfer of the Registered  Office’ enabling relocation of corporate centres across  the European Union (European Commission, 2003b).  The proposal is faced with the task of solving diffi-  culties relating to board structure and employee par-  ticipation (European Commission, communication,  2003b). These difficulties refer to the nation- and  region-specific determinants of corporate centre relo-  cation, in particular to corporate governance (see Fig-  ure 3).  Based on the evidence from previous studies on the  cross-state relocations between metropolitan centres  in the United States, and based on our framework,  we propose that in the future cross-nation corporate  centre relocations will occur in the European Union  if the plans of the European Commission to remove  European Management Journal Vol. 22, No. 2, pp. 141–149, April 2004 147  legal barriers (e.g. harmonization of company law,  labour law, company tax, and other relevant  legislation) against corporate centre relocations are  implemented. Freed from these specific barriers at  the national and regional level, top management of  European companies can base corporate centre  location decisions on the other determinants of the  framework, that is, the firm-specific, the industry-  specific, the metropole-specific and the other nation-  and region-specific determinants.  Research Limitations and Future  Research  Clearly, further research is needed. This study pro-  vides preliminary evidence on corporate centre relo-  cation, but more work needs to be done. So far we  have assumed the corporate centre as a whole. We  found very few relocations of corporate centres as a  whole. However, corporations may relocate certain  functions of their corporate centre. For example, Ahold  relocated its Treasury and Corporate Finance Depart-  ment from its corporate centre in the Dutch city of  Zaandam to its new financial centre, Ahold Finance  Group Suisse, in Geneva, Switzerland (Ahold, 17  April 2002). The cost and benefits of relocation may  differ by corporate centre function. Our framework  only considers the centre as a whole. Future research  may analyse the forces for relocation by corporate  centre function.  Finally, corporations may relocate their divisional or  business unit centres instead of their corporate centres.  An example is the division Organon of Akzo-Nobel  which was relocated in 2002 from the Dutch city of  Oss, where the company was founded in 1923, to the  centre of activity of the drug industry; New Jersey,  United States. ‘By establishing an international head-  quarters in the US, the company will ensure a strong  focus on the US market and help to build its position  there. This location will also provide better options  to partner with various technology and health care  oriented companies, primarily based in The United  States’ (Organon 25 April, 2001). Cross-border relo-  cations of divisional or business unit centres may be  an interesting topic for future research.  Conclusion  In this paper we faced the paradox of, on the one  hand, the international mobility of the corporate busi-  nesses, like transferring manufacturing activities  abroad, and, on the other hand, the stickiness of the  corporate centre within national boundaries. Cor-  porations may expand their international sales and  relocate functions like IT and R&D abroad but relo-  cations of corporate centres are most times confined  CORPORATE CENTRES  to national borders. Empirical research reveals that  in the United States corporate centre relocations  between States are common, while in the European  Union cross-nation relocations are almost absent. To  contribute to a managerial understanding of these  phenomena, we propose a conceptual framework of  the determinants of corporate centre location. We  have identified four categories of determinants: firm-  specific determinants, industry-specific determinants,  metropole-specific determinants, and nation- and  region-specific determinants. These determinants  may explain why corporate centres are sticky in gen-  eral.  Nation- and region-specific determinants, to be more  precise, company legislation, may be an insurmount-  able barrier to cross-nation corporate centre relo-  cations within the European Union. We predict the  stickiness of corporate centres in the European Union  will diminish if the European Union integration pro-  cess proceeds and, in particular, if the expected EU  proposal for the ‘Fourteenth Company Law Directive  on the Transfer of the Registered Office’ regarding  the removal of legal barriers will be implemented.  The time that European corporate centres were sticky  and stayed at home because of these legal barriers  may soon be over. Both national and EU govern-  ments and EU companies should take the determi-  nants of corporate centre location into account to pre-  pare for future developments.

Top Management Team Advice Seeking and  Exploratory Innovation: The Moderating Role of  TMT Heterogeneityjoms_919 1343..1364  Alexander S. Alexiev, Justin J. P. Jansen,  Frans A. J. Van den Bosch and Henk W. Volberda  Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University  abstract Research on strategic decision making has considered advice-seeking behaviour as  an important top management team attribute that influences organizational outcomes. Yet,  our understanding about how top management teams utilize advice to modify current  strategies and pursue exploratory innovation is still unclear. To uncover the importance of  advice seeking, we delineate between external and internal advice seeking and investigate their  impact on exploratory innovation. We also argue that top management team heterogeneity  moderates the impact of advice seeking on exploratory innovation. Findings indicated that  both external and internal advice seeking are important determinants of a firm’s exploratory  innovation. In addition, we observed that top management team heterogeneity facilitates firms  to act upon internal advice by combining different perspectives and developing new products  and services. Interestingly, heterogeneous top management teams appeared to be less effective  to leverage external advice and pursue exploratory innovation.  INTRODUCTION  In the face of market or technological discontinuities senior managers are confronted  with the need to facilitate or champion exploratory innovation (Benner and Tushman,  2003; Hoffman and Hegarty, 1993). Exploratory innovation builds on new knowledge  and requires the departure from existing skills and capabilities (Benner and Tushman,  2003; Jansen et al., 2006). This type of innovation is crucial for organizations operating  in more dynamic environments ( Jansen et al., 2006), and is considered to be key to an  organization’s long-term survival (Levinthal and March, 1993). Studies have shown that  some top management teams (TMTs) have the ability to recognize distant opportunities  and devote organizational resources to exploratory innovation, while others fail to do so  and put their organizations at risk of becoming obsolete (Day, 1994; Kaplan et al., 2003;  Address for reprints: Alexander S.

Journal of Management Studies 47:7 November 2010  doi: 10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00919.x  Young et al., 2001). In this sense, the impact of TMTs on the pursuit of exploratory  innovation has emerged as an important theme.  Previous research has shown that TMTs play an important role by orchestrating  strategic renewal, including organizational reorientations (Tushman and Rosenkopf,  1996; Virany et al., 1992), new product launches (Boeker, 1997; Ciborra, 1996;  Eisenhardt and Tabrizi, 1995; Song and Montoya-Weiss, 1998), and changes in research  and development strategies (Kor, 2006). Although TMTs can influence organizational  responses by establishing formal and informal coordinating mechanisms for implemen-  tation of exploratory innovation ( Jansen et al., 2006), little attention has been given to  the ways in which TMTs deal with knowledge sources that can enable them to notice and  interpret environmental change, or that influence their decisions whether or not to  pursue certain courses of action. Interestingly, researchers have observed that top man-  agement attribution biases can lead to the persistence of existing strategies and the  avoidance of exploratory efforts (Hambrick et al., 1993; Kaplan et al., 2003). Blame is  attributed to failed attempts of exploration rather than to lack of exploration (Danneels,  2008). As a result, firms follow paths where they have solid prior experience and make  investments to proximate markets rather than distant ones (Dimov and De Holan, 2010).  Executives are often unable to recognize new opportunities unless they are closely related  to their existing knowledge and skills (Haynie et al., 2009). Little investigation has been  made into the ways in which management teams use their knowledge sources to over-  come these biases. Following from this, tracing how TMTs develop views on potential  courses of action and overcome the persistence of existing strategies, can carry important  benefits for research and practice.  Strategic decision making literature has proposed executives’ advice-seeking behav-  iour as an important determinant of TMTs’ decisions about whether or not to modify  current strategies (McDonald and Westphal, 2003) and pursue exploratory innovation. A  network of external advisers – managers at other companies – provide knowledge to  TMTs to stay in touch with environmental changes. In addition, top executives maintain  linkages with managers from within their own organizations. These lower-level manag-  ers are another important knowledge source as they may possess critical operational  information or propose their own initiatives for exploratory innovation (Bower, 1970;  Burgelman, 1983). Thus, advice from external and internal sources are two independent  information streams that can provide TMTs with new knowledge and qualitative assess-  ments of current and future exploratory innovation strategies. In this study, we argue that  the extent to which senior executives seek and use advice is associated with the inclina-  tion of organizations to pursue exploratory innovation (Arendt et al., 2005; Balkundi and  Kilduff, 2005; McDonald and Westphal, 2003; McDonald et al., 2008).  We provide a refined understanding of senior executives’ role in pursuing exploratory  innovation and contribute to prior literature in at least two important ways. Firstly, we  probe into the mechanisms that connect TMT advice-seeking behaviours to exploratory  innovation as an organizational-level outcome. We go beyond previous studies that have  sought to explain organizational innovation with top management group demographics  or individual-level executive attributes (e.g. Barker and Mueller, 2002; Papadakis and  Barwise, 2002; Srivastava and Lee, 2005; West and Anderson, 1996). We emphasize that  TMT behaviour is another crucial determinant of an organization’s exploratory effort  A. S. Alexiev et al.1344  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  (Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Simsek et al., 2005). To elaborate that, we examine TMT  advice-seeking behaviours directed both externally and internally (cf. Arendt et al., 2005;  McDonald and Westphal, 2003; McDonald et al., 2008). Power and social identity  theories have explained the tendency of individual senior executives to prefer one type  over the other (Menon and Pfeffer, 2003; Menon et al., 2006). For instance, a preference  for internal advice may be associated with in-group favouritism and out-group deroga-  tion while the choice for external advice may be triggered by internal competition and  extensive criticism of internal ideas (Menon and Pfeffer, 2003). Yet, empirical evidence  is still lacking on whether these theoretical mechanisms continue to be relevant on a  group level, that is, whether the cumulative advice-seeking behaviour of the TMT can  implicate the pursuit of exploratory innovation.  Secondly, we acknowledge the role of TMT composition in the processing of acquired  advice by studying the moderating role of TMT heterogeneity. TMT heterogeneity  refers to the degree to which there are differences in demographic, functional, and  background dimensions in team composition (Simons et al., 1999). Since heterogeneous  teams approach information processing and decision making differently than do homo-  geneous ones (Dahlin et al., 2005; Van Knippenberg and Schippers, 2007), we suggest  that the impact of external and internal advice seeking is contingent upon TMT hetero-  geneity. Characteristically, heterogeneous teams are able to recombine acquired infor-  mation and knowledge in different ways (Rodan and Galunic, 2004) and to connect with  a qualitatively more diverse set of advisers from both across and within firm boundaries  (Granovetter, 1973; Hoffman and Maier, 1961; Jackson, 1992; Reagans et al., 2004). In  this sense, we argue that TMT heterogeneity moderates the relationship between both  types of advice seeking and exploratory innovation. As a result, our study contributes to  new insights as to how TMT heterogeneity affects the effectiveness of different behav-  ioural attributes (i.e. external and internal advice seeking) to exploratory innovation.  LITERATURE AND HYPOTHESES  TMT Advice Seeking and Exploratory Innovation  Exploratory innovation is radical and designed to meet the needs of emerging customers  or markets (Benner and Tushman, 2003). It requires new knowledge or departure from  existing knowledge and often is associated with experimentation, flexibility, and diver-  gent thinking (Levinthal and March, 1993; McGrath, 2001). Exploratory innovation  offers new designs, new approaches to new markets, or the utilization of new distribution  channels (Benner and Tushman, 2003). The rationale to pursue exploratory innovation  rests on the insight that it is important for a firm’s long-term survival and for its ability  to cope with discontinuous environmental change (Levinthal and March, 1993; March,  1991).  To pursue exploratory innovation, organizations must engage in distant search and  radical product development during which they face high uncertainty about their prob-  ability of success ( Jansen et al., 2006). This makes exploration a non-trivial option and  organizations have a tendency to persist with existing strategies and with exploitation of  current products and markets. This tendency is often associated with absence of systems  TMT Advice Seeking 1345  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  for monitoring and analysing environmental signals or for fostering action in response to  these signals. Managers who dare to explore also risk punishment and attribution of  blame if their exploration efforts fail (Danneels, 2008; Sitkin, 1992). Firms also become  deeply embedded in the demands of existing customers, which obstructs them from  adopting emerging disruptive technologies (Christensen and Bower, 1996; Pfeffer and  Salancik, 1978).  Surmounting the persistence of existing strategies can be achieved when senior execu-  tives become involved as product champions or organizational sponsors to exploratory  innovation initiatives (Day, 1994). In such cases, TMTs actively participate in resolving  issues regarding resource allocation and modification of organizational requirements  (Bower, 1970; Ettlie and Subramaniam, 2004). For example, Kaplan et al. (2003) found  that the TMTs of some major pharmaceutical firms are particularly skilled in recogniz-  ing external discontinuities and adequately committing organizational resources to stra-  tegic renewal. In recent literature, scholars have studied how TMT advice-seeking  behaviour is associated with the motivation of TMTs to focus their attention on envi-  ronmental discontinuities. Advice seeking is defined as the formation of opinions, atti-  tudes, and judgments through deliberate information exchange with other individuals,  also called advisers (Bonaccio and Dalal, 2006; Brehmer and Hagafors, 1986; Sniezek  and Buckley, 1995; Sniezek et al., 2004). Multiple studies have suggested that advice  seeking is a ubiquitous phenomenon as senior executives have a tendency to rely on oral  and personal information sources more heavily than they do on written and impersonal  ones, such as reports or outputs from management information systems (Brown and  Eisenhardt, 1997; Elenkov, 1997; McDonald and Westphal, 2003; Mintzberg, 1973).  The focus of the concept of advice seeking lies primarily on the intensity of effort with  which TMTs pursue advice rather than on the particular source of advice. In this sense,  advisers to the TMT can be both external and internal to the organization, including  managers of other firms, or lower level managers within the same organization.  The primary role of advice seeking is considered to be the task-related information  exchange that can improve the probability of accurate decisions (Bonaccio and Dalal,  2006; Goldsmith and Fitch, 1997; McDonald and Westphal, 2003). Advisers also offer  decision makers new alternatives that may have not been considered earlier and provide  new perspectives on the problem at hand. Credible advice from external and internal  sources can alter the choices TMT members make and may guide subsequent organi-  zational action and behaviour away from established patterns and routines (Druckman,  2001).  Previous qualitative research on individual level has viewed external advice seeking  and internal advice seeking as alternatives to each other highlighting social identity and  power issues. Firstly, in hierarchical organizations, some managers tend to prefer exter-  nal advisers over internal ones, because they see the latter as competitive threats to their  position and status (Menon and Pfeffer, 2003). Acknowledging ideas and suggestions  from internal advisers can be seen as a transfer of power to rivals who are also competing  for organizational rewards (Salancik and Pfeffer, 1982). Such status implications may  prompt managers to be less inclined to seek for internal advice. Furthermore, internal  knowledge is more readily available, allowing managers to be more thorough in exam-  ining it and thus be more critical of it compared to external advice. This can lead to the  A. S. Alexiev et al.1346  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  overvaluation of external advice, solely based on its relative scarcity and costs to obtain  (Menon and Pfeffer, 2003; Menon et al., 2006). Secondly, other managers may prefer  internal advisers and resist knowledge from external sources, known as the ‘not-invented-  here’ syndrome (Katz and Allen, 1982). The tendency to dismiss external knowledge  may bias managers towards considering internal ideas as superior to advice gained from  outside sources, even in situations when the latter would have more advantages to the  organization. In such situations, managers that rely solely on internal sources of advice  may reinforce a perception of reality that ridicules external sources and glorifies infor-  mation that has come only from within their own firm. Consequently, on a TMT level,  the presence of externally or internally oriented managers can determine the degree of  external or internal advice-seeking behaviour of the group. Therefore, we distinguish  these two behaviours as two independent TMT-level characteristics, each representing  the external or internal advice-seeking activities of different members of the team.  External Advice Seeking and Exploratory Innovation  External advice seeking may be beneficial to facilitating exploratory innovation as  organizational outcome as it enables TMTs to span organizational boundaries and gain  new external knowledge. External advisers that possess specialized knowledge can affect  TMT cognition with regard to possibilities for new learning alliances, technological  transfers, and knowledge exchange (Kaplan et al., 2003). The more actively a TMT  seeks external advice, the wider the array of opportunities to acquire and assimilate  knowledge that is not yet known by TMT members. For instance, Cao et al. (2006)  argued that CEO turnover, and arguably of any other senior executive, would have  negative consequences for the firm’s exploration due to the loss of the external social  capital resources that they possess. In addition to spanning organizational boundaries,  external advice can be instrumental in coping with resistance to radical organizational  changes that accompany exploratory innovation. Seeking external advice can facilitate  the effort of the TMT to provide legitimacy for particular exploratory strategies. For  instance, external managers can be consulted with the purposes of training employees to  work with unfamiliar technologies, managing the process of change, or substantiating the  necessity of the intended shift towards exploratory innovation (Gable, 1996; Ko et al.,  2005).  Finally, seeking external advice may also assist in reaching consensus among TMT  members. TMT members may be in competition with one another for promotion within  the hierarchy and thus have biases towards particular exploratory efforts that can bring  them personal status gains. Thus, they may be unwilling to support projects proposed by  their internal rivals (Menon and Pfeffer, 2003; Menon et al., 2006), which can also be an  obstacle to achieving organizational commitment to radical changes. External advice  seeking can be used for reaching consensus among disagreeing sides through the supply  of independent analyses and evaluation of proposals. Hence, we predict that TMT  external advice seeking enables organizations to pursue exploratory innovation.  Hypothesis 1: TMT external advice seeking will be positively related to a firm’s explor-  atory innovation.  TMT Advice Seeking 1347  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  Internal Advice Seeking and Exploratory Innovation  TMTs may also use internal advice seeking as leverage to innovation that departs from  existing products and markets. Firstly, by allowing for internal consultation, a climate of  openness to daring new ideas is created. Under the frame of trust that internal advice  seeking creates inside the organization (Inkpen and Choudhury, 1995; Sniezek and Van  Swol, 2001), the process of idea generation is catalysed. If the TMT has established a  pattern of seeking advice internally, other organizational members would be more  willing to share their ideas, especially when the ideas they present could be seen as  unconventional or when proposing new ideas diverges greatly from their existing job  description and function. Prior studies have suggested that this type of consultative mode  for decision making creates a positive atmosphere for exploratory innovation (Somech,  2006; Vroom and Yetton, 1973). Not seeking internal advice may seal off opportunities  for potentially valuable initiatives stemming from within the organization itself.  Secondly, TMTs that look for input from other organizational members have the  ability to form more feasible, as opposed to bold but unrealistic, exploratory innovation  strategies. Seeking internal advice makes TMTs more aware of the existing skills and  capabilities of the firm and that may prove crucial to the implementation of exploratory  strategies. Trying to implement radical product diversification, for instance, may fail  because the TMT did not foresee a mismatch between the required and available  resources or competences needed to produce and market new products (Grant, 1996;  Wernerfelt, 1984). Consulting functional specialist managers to undergo thorough analy-  ses of new ideas may provide useful feedback and criticism (Menon and Pfeffer, 2003)  and highlight important details about the implementation phases of radically new  product development projects or process improvements.  Hypothesis 2: TMT internal advice seeking will be positively related to a firm’s explor-  atory innovation.  The Moderating Role of TMT Heterogeneity  Besides directly relating external and internal advice seeking to exploratory innovation,  it is also important to consider how acquired advice is further processed within TMTs.  TMT heterogeneity is a compositional characteristic that strongly influences the cogni-  tive and information processing capabilities of TMTs. Heterogeneity refers to the degree  to which there are differences along demographic, functional, and background dimen-  sions in the composition of a group (Simons et al., 1999; Van Knippenberg and  Schippers, 2007). Heterogeneity enhances problem solving, judgment, and decision-  making capabilities through team-level processing of unique job-relevant information,  team reflexivity, and healthy task-related conflicts (Hinsz et al., 1997; Van Knippenberg  and Schippers, 2007; VanKnippenberg et al., 2004). Interestingly, prior studies have also  shown that team heterogeneity can also have detrimental effects on group functioning  due to processes of social categorization and emotional conflict (Mannix and Neale,  2005; Pelled et al., 1999; Van Knippenberg and Schippers, 2007). Each of these ‘opti-  mistic’ and ‘pessimistic’ views may prevail depending on the characteristics of the task at  A. S. Alexiev et al.1348  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  hand (Mannix and Neale, 2005; Pelled et al., 1999). The primary task of external and  internal advice seeking is information acquisition, therefore we consider the mechanisms  of the ‘optimistic’ view of TMT heterogeneity as the most relevant and applicable for this  context. As heterogeneous TMTs approach and process advice differently to homoge-  neous ones (Dahlin et al., 2005), we argue that the effectiveness of both types of advice  seeking will depend on the degree of TMT heterogeneity.  Regarding external advice seeking and exploratory innovation, we expect that the  benefits of using external advice in generating exploratory innovation will be amplified  when TMTs are heterogeneous. Because the external networks of heterogeneous TMTs  are less overlapping, external advice seeking provides a wider range of possible unique  information inflows (Granovetter, 1973; Reagans et al., 2004). Heterogeneous TMTs are  able to connect to a larger pool of potential external advisers from various areas of  expertise (Hambrick, 1994), and enhance their ability to create novel strategic combi-  nations for generating exploratory innovation (Hansen, 1999). Rather, homogeneous  TMTs would likely regard information from external contacts as redundant, causing  them to remain insensitive to environmental changes and external threats. In addition to  this, the cohesiveness associated with homogeneous TMTs (Coleman, 1988) can con-  tribute to the development of social control mechanisms that can stifle attempts for  radical thinking and ideas. Therefore, even though senior executives may increase their  external advice-seeking behaviour, they will face difficulties to put more radical and  unconventional proposals on the table and thus would prefer to conform to the status  quo. Strong cohesion also raises suspicion against external information, creating an ‘us  versus them’ mentality and ‘not-invented-here’ bias (Katz and Allen, 1982).  With regard to integrating acquired external advice, heterogeneous teams also have a  larger absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990; Van den Bosch et al., 2003).  Members of such teams come from varying knowledge backgrounds and are able to  recognize patterns in idiosyncratic ways and to contribute with multiple interpretations  on a single piece of advice. Such heterogeneity leads to the creation of more original and  valuable exploratory ideas than, in comparison with, if senior executives with similar  backgrounds were to pool their ideas (Van den Bosch et al., 1999). A homogeneous  TMT may not seek external advice that is difficult to comprehend or to relate to their  existing knowledge base, thereby limiting the potential for exploratory innovation.  Hypothesis 3: TMT heterogeneity moderates the relationship between TMT external  advice seeking and exploratory innovation, such that TMT external advice seeking is  more positively associated with exploratory innovation as TMT heterogeneity  increases.  We also argue that TMT heterogeneity enables TMTs to apply internal advice more  effectively to pursue exploratory innovation. The availability of heterogeneous skills and  knowledge among TMT members often implies that different perspectives are repre-  sented at a higher hierarchical level within organizations (Ibarra, 1995; Podolny and  Baron, 1997). Ideas for developing exploratory innovation often originate from lower  organizational ranks in the form of minority dissent to established procedures and ways  of doing things. A heterogeneous TMT means that various minorities are likely to have  TMT Advice Seeking 1349  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  representation at the highest level in the organization. The opportunity to connect with  a similar individual from the TMT increases the minorities’ willingness to share infor-  mation (Burt, 1982; Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998). A lack of representation, on the other  hand, lowers the probability of acceptance of novel ideas (De Dreu and West, 2001). If  heterogeneity is low, such organizational members are likely to consider themselves  excluded and on the peripheral, with their proposals lacking impetus and legitimacy.  When there is diversity of top executives’ prior related knowledge, increasing the level  of internal advice seeking can lead to more original interpretations to seemingly non-  radical and incremental improvements suggested by the internal advisers (Cohen and  Levinthal, 1990). Heterogeneous TMTs therefore have a stronger ability to assess the  feasibility of exploratory ideas, because the members of heterogeneous TMTs are each  in dialogue and relate to different internal advisers. In comparison with homogeneous  TMTs, the variation in the pool of advisers to heterogeneous TMTs is much larger. Such  TMTs have a higher capacity to assimilate and incorporate highly-specialized and tacit  information from their internal advisers into their decision making (Hansen, 1999).  Hence, internal advice that flows towards heterogeneous TMTs is richer and contributes  to their advantage over homogeneous TMTs with regard to the contributions to a firm’s  exploratory innovation.  Hypothesis 4: TMT heterogeneity moderates the relationship between TMT internal  advice seeking and exploratory innovation, such that TMT internal advice seeking is  more positively associated with exploratory innovation as TMT heterogeneity  increases.  METHODS  Sample and Data Collection  Our empirical research was conducted at small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) across a  wide variety of industries in The Netherlands. We focused on TMTs within SMEs as  prior studies had suggested that SMEs cannot rely on slack resources or extensive systems  to pursue exploratory innovation. Because of this, TMTs in small and medium-sized  companies possess a higher discretion concerning decisions related to exploratory inno-  vation (Simsek et al., 2005). Our primary source of data was a survey sent to a sample of  7884 firms drawn from the REACH electronic database, the largest information source  about organizations registered in The Netherlands Chambers of Commerce. To ensure  we were able to survey knowledgeable respondents for typically confidential information  (Miller et al., 1998), we addressed the survey strictly to the CEO. Two weeks after the  initial mailing, we sent reminder notes and followed up with telephone calls to increase  responses. We obtained fully completed surveys from 705 respondents (8.94 per cent  response rate). The final sample included firms from multiple industries, categorized into  four broad groups: manufacturing (34 per cent), construction (17.7 per cent), services (14  per cent), and others (34.2 per cent). The average number of employees was 58  (S.D. = 44), the average firm age was 19.10 years (S.D. = 10.11), and the average TMT  size was 4.9 (S.D. = 4.96) individuals.  A. S. Alexiev et al.1350  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  To test for non-response bias, we examined differences between respondents and  non-respondents. A t-test showed no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the two  groups based on the number of full-time employees, revenues, and years since the firm’s  founding. We also compared early and late respondents and paper and web respondents  in terms of demographic characteristics and model variables. These comparisons did not  reveal any significant differences (p > 0.05), indicating that differences between respon-  dents were not related to non-response bias. To examine reliability issues associated with  single-informant data, we surveyed an additional TMT member from each respondent  firm. We received a total of 104 second-respondent surveys, or 14.8 per cent of our final  sample, from firms that were comparable in size, age, and revenues to our full sample.  We calculated an inter-rater agreement score (rwg) for each study variable ( James et al.,  1993). The median inter-rater agreement ranged from 0.88 to 0.93, which suggests high  agreement. The examination of intra-class correlations also revealed a strong level of  inter-rater reliability: correlations were consistently significant at the 0.001 level ( Jones  et al., 1983).  We also examined the potential for the occurrence of single method bias. We per-  formed Harman’s one-factor test on items included in our regression model to examine  whether common method bias augmented relationships. We found multiple factors, and  the first factor did not account for the majority of variance. Also, we tested whether the  addition of a single latent method factor connected with all the item scales would  significantly improve the fit over a model with just the studied constructs as latent factors  (Podsakoff et al., 2003; Widaman, 1985). The overall chi-square fit statistics for the  model with the common method factor was significant (c2/d.f. = 1.761, CFI = 0.989,  RMSEA = 0.033), but the incremental fit index had a rho of 0.006, which suggests  non-significant improvement. Additionally, the factor loadings for the studied constructs  remained significant even after we had considered the method effect. These results  suggest that common method bias did not dramatically affect the study’s findings and  that the respondents were able to differentiate well between the variables.  Measurement of Constructs  We used existing scales from previous literature that were verified through various  analyses.  Exploratory innovation. To measure exploratory innovation we adapted a five-item  measure developed by Jansen et al. (2006). It captures whether organizations depart  from existing knowledge and pursue radical innovations for emerging customers or  markets. The respondents were asked about the extent to which: (1) the organization  accepts demands that go beyond existing products and services; (2) they invent new  products and services; (3) they experiment with new products and services in their local  market; (4) they commercialize products and services that are completely new to the firm;  and (5) they utilize new opportunities in new markets (a = 0.85). To assess reliability and  validity for the exploratory innovation scale we correlated the responses with objective  measures. Following previous literature (He and Wong, 2004; Manu, 1992), we used the  percentage of total sales accounted for by new products introduced within the past three  TMT Advice Seeking 1351  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  years. This measure showed significant positive correlation with the perceptual measure  for exploratory innovation (r = 0.33, p < 0.001), which increased our confidence in the  scale’s validity.  External and internal advice seeking. We followed McDonald and Westphal (2003) and  adapted a team-level scale that captured the extent of TMT advice-seeking behaviour.  We generated a number of alternative wordings and variations, which were refined and  validated by gathering expert researchers’ opinions and through pre-testing among  managers for clarity and unambiguity. In the final version of the scale, we asked the  respondents to rate: (1) frequency of the TMT’s advice seeking; (2) the extent to which  they gathered knowledge with regard to their current strategy; and (3) the extent to which  they sought advice with regard to future strategy. We repeated the questions twice, firstly  about advice sought from managers from other organizations (external advice seeking), and  secondly, about advice sought from within their own organization (internal advice seeking).  To provide evidence for convergent and discriminant validity, we used exploratory  factor analysis. The results replicated the intended two-factor structure, with each item  loading clearly on its intended factor (all factor loadings were between 0.86 and 0.91 for  external advice seeking and between 0.88 and 0.94 for internal advice seeking). The  Cronbach’s a were 0.89 and 0.93 for external and internal advice seeking, respectively.  TMT heterogeneity. The scale used for TMT heterogeneity was adopted from Campion  et al. (1993). It is a five-item composite measure that asked respondents to assess the  degree of heterogeneity on both demographic and functional attributes, namely exper-  tise, background, experience, complementary skills, and education (a = 0.74). Research  has shown that composite team heterogeneity constructs are good predictors of team  outcomes (Van Knippenberg and Schippers, 2007).  Control variables. We included various control variables that have appeared in previous  literature as determinants of exploratory innovation (e.g. Jansen et al., 2006; Sidhu et al.,  2004, 2007; Srivastava and Lee, 2005). Because larger firms may have more resources  yet may lack the flexibility to pursue exploratory innovation, we included the natural  logarithm of the number of full-time employees within organizations to account for firm  size. Secondly, incumbent firms may be more inclined towards existing strategies and  face difficulties in pursuing exploratory efforts; we included firm age measured by the  natural logarithm of the number of years from founding. Thirdly, TMT size might affect  dynamics in decision making processes and therefore we included TMT size by mea-  suring the number of senior executives who are responsible for strategy formulation and  implementation (Siegel and Hambrick, 2005). Fourthly, context or industry effects may  influence the extent to which organizations pursue exploratory innovation (Sidhu et al.,  2007). In view of this, we included four industry dummies based on Standard Industry  Classification codes: manufacturing, construction, services, and other industries (cf.  McGrath, 2001). Fifthly, environmental attributes such as dynamism tend to affect  organizations in pursuing exploratory innovation. We therefore included a four-item  measure for environmental dynamism (cf. Dill, 1958; Jansen et al., 2006). The scale for  environmental dynamism (a = 0.80) tapped into the rate of change and the instability of  A. S. Alexiev et al.1352  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  the external environment. Finally, we also controlled for the level of exploitative inno-  vation as prior studies have argued that it may influence the level of exploratory  innovation (Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996). We used a four-item scale (Jansen et al.,  2006) that captures the extent to which organizations build upon existing knowledge and  pursue incremental innovations that meet the needs of existing customers or markets  (a = 0.73).  Validation of Measures  For all multi-item scales, we constructed an integrated confirmatory factor analysis  (CFA) in order to test for convergent and discriminant validity. Each item was con-  strained to load only on its respective latent variable. The results showed a good fit within  the model (c2/d.f. = 2.039, CFI = 0.982, RMSEA = 0.038). All loadings were significant  (p < 0.001), which showed the convergent validity of the scales. The factor correlation  matrix had moderate values (between 0.142 and 0.235), and we tested whether each  correlation differed significantly from unity. We constructed models where this correla-  tion was constrained to one and compared with the unconstrained model. The results  from each of the six pairwise comparisons showed that constraining to unity worsens the  models’ fit in each case (rho values between 0.222 and 0.390), which attested to the  discriminant validity of the latent variables.  ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  Table I contains the descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations between the numeric  variables used in the analysis. We constructed linear regression models and have  reported the standardized coefficients in Table II. Model 1 (Table II) is the baseline  model and includes only the control variables, Model 2 shows the main effects, and  Model 3 includes the interaction effects.  The required conditions for the regression method were satisfied. To reduce the  impact of multicollinearity, we mean-centred the independent variables that were used  in the interaction terms (Aiken and West, 1991). We used variance inflation factors (VIFs)  to judge the presence of multicollinearity in the models. Across all models, the highest  VIF was 1.42, which is well below the cut-off point of 10 (Neter et al., 1990). The full  model showed an R2 of 30.9 per cent. Of the control variables, TMT size is positively  associated with exploratory innovation (p < 0.01). Environmental dynamism is associ-  ated with pursuing exploratory innovation (p < 0.001) as organizations try to avoid the  obsolescence of their product portfolio. Interestingly, our results also indicate that  exploitative innovation is positively associated with exploratory innovation (p < 0.01),  which suggests that firms often possess both types of innovative capabilities.  We will discuss the regression results obtained in Model 3. As predicted, external  advice seeking has a positive and significant association with exploratory innovation  (b = 0.073, p < 0.05). Hypothesis 1 is supported. As predicted by Hypothesis 2, Model 3  indicates a positive and significant relationship between internal advice seeking and  exploratory innovation (b = 0.123, p < 0.001). Overall, our results indicate that both  TMT Advice Seeking 1353  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  T  ab  le  I.

Alexiev et al.1354  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  types of advice seeking contribute to exploratory innovation; however, internal advice  seeking has a relatively stronger association than external advice seeking.  Contrary to Hypothesis 3 that posited a positive moderating effect of TMT hetero-  geneity, Model 3 shows that TMT heterogeneity reduces the strength of the positive  relationship between external advice seeking and exploratory innovation (b = -0.088,  p < 0.01). Hypothesis 3 was not supported. We did find support for Hypothesis 4, as  TMT heterogeneity positively moderates the effectiveness of internal advice seeking to  exploratory innovation (b = 0.070, p < 0.05). Whereas TMT heterogeneity decreases the  effectiveness of external advice seeking, our results show that TMT heterogeneity  increases the relation of internal advice seeking on developing new products and services  for emerging markets. Figure 1 plots the interaction effects using the values of one  standard deviation above (i.e. high level) or below the mean (i.e. low level) of the  advice-seeking variables (Aiken and West, 1991). Figure 1a shows that under high levels  of TMT heterogeneity, the effect of external advice on exploratory innovation has a  slightly negative slope (b = 0.070), but a t-test (Aiken and West, 1991) revealed that this  slope is not significantly different from zero (p > 0.10). Under low levels of TMT  heterogeneity the relationship between external advice seeking and exploratory innova-  tion is positive and significant (b = 0.159, p < 0.01). Figure 1b illustrates the positive  effect of TMT heterogeneity on the relationship between internal advice seeking and  exploratory innovation (Hypothesis 4). The positive slope under high TMT heterogene-  ity is stronger and significant (b = 0.184, p < 0.001), while under low TMT heterogeneity  Table II.

Thus, heterogeneous TMTs are in a better  position to utilize internal advice and to develop exploratory innovation than homoge-  neous TMTs.  DISCUSSION  Upper-echelon theory argues that senior executives act on the basis of highly personal-  ized interpretations of the situations they face (Hambrick and Mason, 1984). Several  studies have acknowledged that the ability to respond to opportunities for exploratory  innovation, such as performance declines or the emergence of discontinuous technolo-  gies, is a function of TMT cognition, and particularly their search for and use of advice  (Gilbert, 2005; Kaplan et al., 2003; McDonald and Westphal, 2003). Our results provide  strong evidence that TMT external and internal advice-seeking behaviour is an impor-  tant determinant for firms pursuing exploratory innovation.

Alexiev et al.1356  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  internal advice-seeking behaviour, TMTs are not only able to signal successfully envi-  ronmental discontinuities and threats, but are also able to facilitate strategic renewal and  increase exploratory innovation in their respective organizations (Day, 1994; Volberda  et al., 2001).  Our study unites two contrasting theoretical perspectives on the preference and  effectiveness of external versus internal advice seeking. The first perspective puts man-  agers against each other in rivalries to obtain organizational resources and higher status  within the hierarchy (Menon et al., 2006). In this sense, organizations tend to prefer  external to internal advice seeking and utilize information from external sources to  generate new ideas for products and services. The second perspective emphasizes  in-group favouritism and out-group derogation (Katz and Allen, 1982), which explains  the tendency for organizations to incorporate information from internal sources into  strategic decision making and strategic renewal. Our proposition was that both mecha-  nisms have strong merits as predictors of exploratory innovation, thus making a case for  integrating the two perspectives rather than opposing them as mutually exclusive views  (cf. Menon and Pfeffer, 2003). Although our empirical study provides evidence that  TMTs more often seek advice from internal than from external advisors (mean of 4.94  and 3.63, respectively, – see Table I), both types of advice-seeking behaviours contribute  to a firm’s exploratory innovation. In this sense, our study provides important evidence  for answering previous calls for multi-firm and multi-industry research that increases our  understanding of organizational outcomes of managerial information search both within  and across organizational boundaries (Menon and Pfeffer, 2003). Our findings suggest  that future research on advice seeking needs to go beyond investigating potential benefits  of either external or internal advice seeking in isolation. Future research might not only  consider senior executives as environmental monitors and disseminators (Mintzberg,  1973), but also as active information seekers from within their own organizations.  Although the positive correlation between external and internal advice seeking confirms  such a complementary effect, future research needs to uncover contextual attributes that  explain the potential complementarities between both types of advice seeking in increas-  ing important TMT as well as organizational outcomes.  Our findings indicate that external advice seeking is an important TMT determinant  of an organization’s exploratory innovation. External advice seeking not only provides  possibilities for learning new insights; it may also provide legitimacy for particular  exploratory innovations. External advisers can be sought to train employees to work with  unfamiliar technologies, to manage the process of change, and to convince and substan-  tiate the necessity of the intended shift towards exploratory innovation (Hambrick et al.,  1993). By revealing the importance of TMT external advice seeking for exploratory  innovation, our study confirms previous assertions on the importance of organizational  boundary-spanning and distant knowledge search (Ancona and Caldwell, 1992;  Hambrick et al., 1993; Menon and Pfeffer, 2003). Specifically, in addition to knowledge  transfer across boundaries at lower levels within the organization (Henderson and  Cockburn, 1994), our study reveals that upper echelons are also able to encourage firms  to stay abreast of emerging technologies by soliciting external advisers themselves.  This study also indicates that TMT advice seeking from internal sources contributes to  a firm’s exploratory innovation. Through internal advice seeking, TMTs are able to  TMT Advice Seeking 1357  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  catalyse new ideas generation from within the organization and to realize potential  opportunities for new products and services. Our findings provide new insights into the  process of innovation championing literature, which has explored both top-down and  bottom-up origination and development of innovative ventures. Scholars generally agree  that in both cases the role of senior executives is critical. In bottom-up processes, TMT  members need to give impetus and provide strategic context to emerging exploratory  innovation initiatives (Bower, 1970; Burgelman, 1983). In top-down models, senior  executives actively create and champion such initiatives (Day, 1994; Eisenmann and  Bower, 2000). Our study suggests that the implementation of new initiatives may benefit  from a consultative decision-making approach by senior executives. TMTs that encour-  age interaction across hierarchical levels during decision making regarding exploratory  innovation signal that new initiatives are desirable.  Our study also contributes to prior literatures on the role of senior executives in  overcoming the persistence of current strategies. Senior managers are often restrained by  their own perceptual biases or are keen to seek advice exclusively from their closest  contacts (McDonald and Westphal, 2003; McDonald et al., 2008). Our study shows that  the increased information flows surrounding more connected TMT members enable  them to reduce inertia and stimulate organizational change and renewal. Arguably,  internal processes within the TMT may also play an important role for that purpose. We  therefore suggest that future attention needs to be given to specific TMT attributes and  processes such as shared vision, contingency rewards, and social integration that may  influence the extent to which TMTs are inclined to acquire and apply divergent advice  ( Jansen et al., 2008).  In addition to the importance of external and internal advice seeking, we also argued  that TMT heterogeneity increases the effectiveness of both types of advice seeking.  Contrary to our prediction, however, heterogeneous teams were not able to generate  benefits from external advice seeking for pursuing exploratory innovation. A possible  explanation for this rather interesting result could be the notions of local search and  learning as a process of satisficing (March and Simon, 1958; Stuart and Podolony,  1996; Winter, 2000). Heterogeneous TMTs may not be benefiting from external advice  seeking because their members may have sufficient access to heterogeneous knowledge  within the team and consider external advice only as a substitute. Homogeneous  TMTs, on the other hand, may consider external advice as complementary to their  own knowledge sources and skills and are more willing to use external advice as lever-  age to pursue exploratory efforts. In essence, increasing external advice seeking can be  a substitute for the lack of diversity within the team. Still, the combinative impact of  TMT heterogeneity and external advice seeking deserves further attention through  in-depth case studies.  Our study reveals that under heterogeneous TMTs, internal advice has a stronger  relationship with exploratory innovation. Underlying diversity in heterogeneous TMTs  encourages organizational members to share ideas for radical new products or new  uncharted markets (Ibarra, 1995; Podolny and Baron, 1997; Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998).  The possible occurrence of conflict and creation of faultlines between senior executives  with diverse backgrounds deserves more attention in further research (Pelled et al., 1999;  Van Knippenberg and Schippers, 2007). Nonetheless, the study contributes to the  A. S. Alexiev et al.1358  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  literature on TMT heterogeneity with additional evidence that the effects of diversity on  organizational outcomes must be understood beyond the typologies of the demographic  or functional, and as underlying processes of information exchange and decision making  (Van Knippenberg and Schippers, 2007).  For managers, our study suggests important guidelines for analysing and assessing the  use of strategic advice when the organization aims at increasing exploratory innovation.  Firstly, it provides an analytical framework for the possibilities of sourcing distant knowl-  edge by the TMT. Increasing external advice leads to higher exploratory innovation for  homogeneous TMTs, while increasing internal advice seeking leads to higher explor-  atory innovation for heterogeneous TMTs. An increase in external advice for heteroge-  neous TMTs, and an increase in internal advice for homogeneous TMTs would have no  significant effects on exploratory innovation. Secondly, our study provides a caution to  organizational transformation efforts that attempt costly reshuffling of the TMT advice  linkages. The results show that the intensity of advice-seeking behaviour targeted at  acquiring distant knowledge is important for exploratory innovation regardless of  whether it is sourced externally or internally. Thirdly, we encourage selection and  promotion policies that favour heterogeneity in TMTs, since they influence exploratory  innovation more than the use of external advisers.  LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSION  Several limitations of this study deserve discussion. Firstly, although our survey technique  attempted to achieve aggregated measurements for the TMT, not all TMT members in  the responding organizations completed our survey. This may affect construct validity  even though we have attempted to reduce such issues by validating our scales through  inter-rater agreement scores and interclass correlations. Another limitation is the cross-  sectional design of the study, which prevents us from making a firm conclusion about the  direction of causality between the variables we have studied. For instance, firms strong  on exploratory innovation might also be more skilled in attracting and building hetero-  geneous TMTs that are more prone to seek advice more intensely. Future research could  address this shortcoming through a longitudinal set-up.  Future studies could also consider the role of TMT discretion over the innovation  process (Hambrick, 2007; Hambrick and Finkelstein, 1987). Our sample consisted of  SMEs in which TMTs have significant latitude of action. In large organizations, under  multiple layers of hierarchy, TMTs may need to use other levers to steer the organization  towards more exploratory innovation. Under low managerial discretion, advice seeking  may retain its information gathering purpose, but the structure of TMTs’ informal  networks of influence may play a stronger role in executing decisions (Ibarra, 1993;  Krackhardt, 1990). Future research should also investigate when TMTs turn to the  board of directors for advice. This is a special category of advisers, because they also fulfil  monitoring and control functions on behalf of the shareholders (e.g. Hillman and Dalziel,  2003; Westphal, 1999). They can be an important source of advice, especially if they  possess relevant strategic information by virtue of their external network ties (Carpenter  and Westphal, 2001).  TMT Advice Seeking 1359  © 2010 The Authors  Journal of Management Studies © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and  Society for the Advancement of Management Studies  Although this study is focused on the role of TMTs, exploratory innovation in orga-  nizations may be a consequence of factors that exist beyond the scope and power of  senior executives and groups. Organization-wide policies, processes, and cultures may  provide nurturing contexts for the creation of exploratory ideas by stimulating exchange  and combination of knowledge resources at all levels (Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998). Good  examples of these are policies for encouragement of experimentation or for tolerance of  failures (Danneels, 2008). Such contexts can predispose individuals and teams to distant  search and recognition of new opportunities, and may precede the advice-seeking behav-  iours of managers. Exploring the antecedents of advice seeking across different hierar-  chical levels can therefore be a fruitful path for future research.  Finally, we looked at TMT advice seeking through a knowledge and information  exchange lens by adopting a rational model of strategic decision making (Eisenhardt and  Zbaracki, 1992). Strategic decisions, however, may be derived from political interests  and concerns. Particularly in cases where large-scale changes are undertaken, various  groups and stakeholders can become active and senior managers would need to consider  their response to them. Therefore, further research can incorporate a power and politics  perspective and study how the interaction with the rational approach can impact the  organizational outcomes (e.g. Eisenhardt and Bourgeois, 1988; Pfeffer, 1981, 1992).

Vlaar, Frans A.J. Van Den Bosch and Henk W. Volberda  Abstract  The mainstream literature on contracts, rules and procedures presumes that formaliza-  tion is directed at coordination and control, and that its influence on performance is con-  tingent upon firm, transaction and contextual characteristics. In response to recent calls  for inquiries into dialectics in interorganizational relationships, and in an effort to pro-  vide managerial choice with a more prominent position in research on formalization, a  complementary perspective is here being developed. We propose a framework in which  formalization is presented as a duality, involving trade-offs between its functions and  dysfunctions, and eventuating in dialectic tensions with which managers have to cope.  In line with this, we argue that researchers should not only be preoccupied with assess-  ing the ‘rightness’ of governance solutions, but also with the trade-offs and tensions  associated with them. Our framework is illustrated by a case study of an alliance  between a major European financial services firm and one of the world’s leading retail-  ers. The alliance managers in this particular relationship attempted to reduce or capital-  ize on the tensions associated with formalization by: (1) adopting a semi-structure, in  which outcomes were formalized, but behaviour was not; (2) justifying formalization  through referring to factors that were beyond their control, and; (3) alternating their  emphasis on different requirements by each of the partner firms. The article shows that  a dialectic perspective on formalization in interorganizational relationships offers a  promising complement to the mainstream literature.  Keywords: formalization, trade-offs, dialectics, interorganizational cooperation  Introduction  Researchers in the field of interorganizational management have become  increasingly interested in the concept of formalization and its many manifesta-  tions, such as contracts, rules and procedures (e.g. Grandori 1997; Sampson  2003). Hitherto, the majority of their studies have exhibited a rather determinis-  tic character. Transaction cost economics, agency theory and contract theories,  for example, all presuppose that the degree of formalization has to be aligned  with firm, transaction or contextual characteristics to achieve appropriate levels  of coordination, control and, eventually, interorganizational performance (Foss  article title  Organization  Studies  28(04): 437–466  ISSN 0170–8406  Copyright © 2007  SAGE Publications  (Los Angeles,  London, New Delhi  & Singapore)  Paul W.

As is shown in Figure 1,  contributions based on these theories either focus on the relationship between  formalization and its antecedents, or on its relationship with interorganizational  performance (Anderson and Dekker 2005; Sobrero and Schrader 1998).  In such relatively ‘deterministic’ approaches, management’s role is confined to  making the ‘right’ choices; choices that render optimal alignment. Nonetheless,  the literature is infested with examples in which managers make sub-optimal  decisions regarding formalization (e.g. Anderson and Dekker 2005; Sampson  2004), and in which they attempt to attenuate the tensions emanating from for-  malization, instead of simply accepting them (see Blau 1955; Cardinal et al.  2004). This raises the question as to how our understanding of formalization in  interorganizational relationships would change, if more attention were granted to  managerial choice. Consistent with conceptualizations of formalization as being  affected by trade-offs (Galbraith 1977) and managerial choice (see Child 1997),  and in response to recent calls for dialectic perspectives on interorganizational  cooperation (e.g. Das and Teng 2000; De Rond 2003; De Rond and Bouchiki  2004; Vieira da Cunha et al. 2002), we therefore develop a complementary view  on formalization in interorganizational relationships.  The article’s contributions to the literature are twofold. First, we reintroduce  managerial adaptation in this research field, and elucidate how it complements  the relatively deterministic viewpoints on formalization currently prevailing in  the literature congruent with Hatch (1999) and Vieira da Cunha et al. (2002).  We thereby add a theoretical layer to existing conceptualizations of interorga-  nizational structuring efforts. Second, we move beyond the current emphasis in  the literature on formalization’s coordination and control functions (e.g. Foss  and Foss 2005; Gulati and Singh 1998; Madhok 2002). By illuminating its link-  ages with cognition and learning, for example, we elucidate that formalization  has partly assumed new meanings, which may explain why it is still a relevant  concept in today’s business environment.   The article is organized accordingly. First, we introduce a conceptual frame-  work by which we explain how a dialectic perspective on formalization in  interorganizational relationships complements more ‘traditional’ views prevail-  ing in the literature. Subsequently, we provide an overview of formalization’s  functions and dysfunctions, which stand at the basis of such a dialectic perspec-  tive. We then illustrate the framework with a case study of an alliance between a  438 Organization Studies 28(04)  Degree of  formalization  Inter-  organizational  performance     Antecedents at:  • Firm-level  • Transaction-level  • Context-level  First research stream  Second research stream  Figure 1.

Finally, we elaborate on the insights provided by the study, its theoretical and  practical implications, some of its limitations and avenues for future research.  Traditional versus Dialectic Perspectives on Formalization  Before explaining how traditional perspectives on formalization in interorganiza-  tional relationships differ from a dialectic perspective on formalization in interor-  ganizational relationships, we offer a more comprehensive definition of  formalization. As with most concepts ending in ‘-tion’, formalization is ambigu-  ous with regard to process and outcome — ‘between the way one gets there, and  the result’ (Baum and Rowley 2002: 1). It both refers to the process of codifying  and enforcing outputs and behaviours (Ouchi 1979), and to the outcomes of this  process, in the form of contracts, rules and procedures (Hage and Aiken 1966).  Codification suggests that formalization pertains to explicit, systematic proce-  dures that facilitate the classification of phenomena (Boisot 1998). Enforcement  signifies that codified agreements are ‘in force’, permitting parties to make believ-  able promises to each other so that the execution of agreements can ultimately be  exacted (Schwartz and Scott 2003). As Ouchi (1979) indicates, formalization can  pertain to outputs, as well as behaviour. Katz and Kahn (1966: 298), for example,  propose two major categories of formalization: ‘the formulation of organizational  goals and objectives, and the formulation of strategies and procedures for achiev-  ing and assessing progress towards such goals’. Similarly, Simon (1997: 307)  contends that someone ‘may be told what to do, but given considerable leeway as  to how [he or she] will carry out the task’. To recap, following Ouchi (1979) and  Hage and Aiken (1966), we define formalization as the process of codifying and  enforcing output and/or behaviour, and its outcomes in the form of contracts,  rules and procedures.  Researchers adhering to ‘traditional’ views on formalization, as depicted in  Figure 1, generally strive to determine single best governance solutions, depend-  ing upon given firm, transaction and contextual characteristics (Eisenhardt  1989a; Ghoshal and Moran 1996; Cardinal et al. 2004). By using differentiation  models, they polarize costs and benefits, or functions and dysfunctions of vari-  ous governance options, in an effort to ascertain the ‘right’ choice or decision  (Peng and Nisbett 1999). Transaction costs economics, for example, explains the  degree of formalization in interorganizational relationships by referring to trans-  action-characteristics, such as the levels of uncertainty and asset-specificity, and  the frequency with which goods or services are exchanged (Klein et al. 1978;  Williamson 1985). Agency theory, constituting another example, claims that the  degree of formalization should be aligned with the measurability of transactions,  and with partners’ abilities to specify tasks (Eisenhardt 1989a).  Such perspectives fit well with our natural inclination to assume irreconcil-  ability of apparent inconsistencies, implying that a particular degree of formal-  ization is either appropriate or inappropriate. However, they fail to sustain the  tensions inherent in most managerial problems (Das and Teng 2000; Volberda  1998). While focusing on the origins of structuring choices, these perspectives  neglect the consequences of selecting certain governance solutions, and they  Vlaar et al: Towards a Dialectic Perspective 439   © 2007 SAGE Publications.

We complement these views by introducing a dialectic perspective on  formalization, in which interorganizational relationships are regarded as a unity  of opposites, and in which managers are confronted with contradictory values  that compete with each other (Das and Teng 2000; Van de Ven 1992). We thus  replace either–or conceptions of interorganizational governance with both–and  constructions, and we recognize the tensions accruing from the simultaneous  existence of formalization’s functions and dysfunctions, something that con-  forms to descriptions of apparent inconsistencies by other authors (see  Eisenhardt 2000; Lewis 2000; Van de Ven and Poole 1995).  In developing such a perspective, we observe the principles of simultaneity,  locality, minimality and generality (Benson 1977; Vieira da Cunha et al. 2002).  This implies (1) that a dialectic perspective on formalization is grounded on the  interplay between its functions and dysfunctions; (2) that managers have to cope  with the tensions arising from formalization in their daily activities, and that these  cannot be completely solved or forestalled by clever organizational design; (3)  that extreme levels of formalization are less desirable than intermediate levels (see  also Luo 2002; Mintzberg 1994), because they do not offer room for managers to  manoeuvre or cope with tensions, or because they create tensions that are hardly  amenable to management; and (4) that any prescriptions used for managing ten-  sions have to apply to a large range of situations. Juxtaposing such a perspective  alongside the mainstream literature complements ‘traditional’ views on formal-  ization with insights into managerial choice and into the roles that managers  assume when structuring their collaborative relationships. It provides the theoret-  ical depth that is needed to fully exemplify the competing forces that are evident  in interorganizational relationships (Das and Teng 2000), and it promises to yield  a more comprehensive and integrative picture of interorganizational structuring  practices than hitherto available (Das and Teng 2000; Quinn 1988).  As the conceptual framework depicted in Figure 2 shows, we maintain the  notion stemming from more ‘traditional’ perspectives on formalization that firm,  transaction and contextual characteristics affect the need and the ability to for-  malize. However, we also emphasize that managers need to make trade-offs, as  formalization consists of a duality between its functions and dysfunctions, and  that they have to cope with or capitalize on the resulting tensions (see De Rond  and Bouchiki 2004). Concerning trade-offs, we propose that managers do not just  balance ‘competition’ with ‘cooperation’, or ‘flexibility’ with ‘control’ (Das and  Teng 2000; De Rond and Bouchikhi 2004; Volberda 1998), but we suggest that  they poise entire sets of functions and dysfunctions of formalization. The trade-  offs that managers make are dependent upon their perceptions of firm, transaction  and contextual characteristics, and on their knowledge of and experience with for-  malization. These factors influence the extent to which they are able to anticipate  various functions and dysfunctions of formalization, something coinciding with  more general arguments in the alliance capabilities literature, indicating that par-  ties which have more experience and that institutionalize their experience may  achieve superior performance (Kale et al. 2001).  The trade-offs involved do not necessarily have to be made by alliance man-  agers, and they may stem from designed as well as emergent processes (see Ring  440 Organization Studies 28(04)   © 2007 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved. Not for commercial use or unauthorized distribution.   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 21, 2008 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   et al. 2005). Participants at various levels in the alliance make different trade-offs,  and they anticipate different functions and dysfunctions of formalization. The  degree of formalization that ensues is therefore likely to be the joint result of  trade-offs made by various participants in a relationship, bargaining processes,  and the extent to which alliance managers are willing and able to enforce partic-  ular levels of formalization. Formalization may emerge throughout the relation-  ship, but it may also be imposed on participants by the managers that are held  responsible for the performance of the alliance.  Actual degrees of formalization pertaining to relationships entails functions as  well as dysfunctions, including several unanticipated or latent consequences (see  Balogun and Johnson 2004; Blau 1955; Cardinal et al. 2004; Mintzberg 1994; Yu  et al. 2005). Formalization thus generates contradictory forces that are present  simultaneously — beyond the will or power of management — and that have to be  recognized and managed (Clegg et al. 2002b; Huxham and Beech 2003). When  managers apply a certain degree of formalization, because it enables them to con-  trol their partner, for example, they may simultaneously introduce rigidity in deci-  sion-making, and increase another party’s inclination to cover itself against all  kinds of risks. Similarly, when they use formalization to minimize the negative  effects of potential employee turnover, they may concurrently evoke distrust by  partners and reduce their willingness to adapt to changes.  From a traditional perspective, formalization’s influence on interorganiza-  tional performance is then represented as the net effect of its functions and dys-  functions (Katz and Kahn 1966; Luo 2002; Mintzberg 1994). A dialectic  perspective, however, suggests that managerial efforts may affect the relation-  ship between formalization and performance. Blau’s (1955: 13), who already  indicated that ‘social action is more constructive and less patient.

Functions and Dysfunctions of Formalization  A dialectic perspective on formalization not only emphasizes the role of man-  agerial choice, but it also stresses the duality inherent in formalization, which  involves the coexistence of its functions and dysfunctions. A review of the liter-  ature on both the intra- and the interorganizational level discloses that formal-  ization has a variety of functions and dysfunctions (see Tables 1 and 2), with  functions being consequences ‘that change existing conditions in the direction of  socially valued objectives’, and dysfunctions referring to ‘consequences that  interfere with the attainment’ of certain objectives (Blau 1955: 11). Although the  literature is dominated by articles on formalization’s coordination and control  functions (e.g. Foss and Foss 2005; Gulati and Singh 1998; Madhok 2002), our  review suggests that it may also enhance legitimacy and facilitate sensemaking.  442 Organization Studies 28(04)  Functions References  1.

Formalization is associated with the division of labour, and  diminishes the interdependence between partners, while helping them to translate  complex problems into clear and understandable terms (Singh 1997). Formalization  further entails efficient information processing (Galbraith 1977) and a common  language (Grimaldi and Torrisi 2001; Simons 1995), enabling interorganizational  participants to communicate their goals and permitting them to check on each  other’s perceptions. Besides, it is used to signal preferred outcomes and behav-  iours, thereby bringing partners’ expectations in accordance with each other, and  eliminating inefficiencies and misunderstandings (Milewicz and Herbig 1996).  Finally, formalization enables coordination by fuelling and punctuating interac-  tion processes (Mintzberg 1994).  Control: Formalization as a Means to Restrain or Direct Behaviour  The control function of formalization has primarily been emphasized by trans-  action cost economists (c.f. Masten 1996; Oxley 1997; Williamson 1985) and  agency theorists (c.f. Eisenhardt 1989a). These authors contend that relation-  ships are characterized by information-asymmetry, conflicting interests and  ambiguity, so that formalization becomes necessary to circumvent, alleviate or  mitigate opportunistic behaviour (Carson et al. 2006; Williamson 1985). Analogue  to controlling partners, formalization enables control from a distance (Gouldner  1954), control of progress (Simons 1995; Weick 2001) and control of deviation  from objectives (Delmar and Shane 2003). Moreover, formalization facilitates  Vlaar et al: Towards a Dialectic Perspective 443  Dysfunctions References  1.

Finally, formalization facil-  itates control in the form of trust building. It assists parties in demonstrating  their competence and knowledge, and it reduces their uncertainty about the  motives that others have for engaging in interorganizational relationships (Poppo  and Zenger 2002; Vlaar et al., forthcoming).  Legitimacy: Formalization as a Means to Persuade and Convince  Stakeholders  A third function of formalization draws on the concept of legitimacy, stemming  from institutional theory (Baum and Rowley 2002). From this perspective, con-  tracts, rules and procedures offer acceptable accounts of interorganizational activ-  ities, which enhance the legitimacy of collaborative relationships. Formalization  helps parties to demonstrate their competence and professionalism, and it offers a  legitimate basis for managerial intervention (Langley 1988; Sitkin and Bies 1993;  Walsh and Dewar 1987). It thereby increases the resources available for coopera-  tion and augments the survival chances of cooperative endeavours (see Meyer and  Rowan 1977). By increasing the legitimacy of collaborative relationships, for-  malization also heightens the commitment of both internal participants and exter-  nal constituents. This is particularly critical for relationships that are embedded in  dynamic and discontinuous business environments (Kale et al. 2001).  Cognition and Learning: Formalization as a Means to Make Sense  A fourth function of formalization involves cognition and learning. This function  refers to formalization’s role in facilitating sensemaking (Ring and Van de Ven  1989, 1994; Vlaar et al. 2006), and in generating stable and comprehensible  expectations and collective structures from which participants in interorganiza-  tional relationships can construct their actions (Cooray and Ratnatunga 2001;  Shenkar and Zeira 1992; Weick and Roberts 1993). Formalization reduces ambi-  guity (Adler 1993; Lui and Ngo 2004), and thereby fulfils basic human needs for  stability and role clarity (Marginson and Ogden 2005; Ring and Van de Ven  1989). Furthermore, it acts as a binding mechanism and focusing device, hold-  ing events together in people’s heads, and providing them with meaning and  direction (Langley 1988; Simons 1995; Weick 1995, 2001). Formalization also  facilitates sensemaking by increasing the completeness and consistency with  which issues are covered, and by reducing the effects of individual biases and  errors (Ketokivi and Cataãer 2004; Katz and Kahn 1966; Mintzberg 1994). In  addition, it forces people to reflect and think, resulting in deeper insights about  the potential causal factors underlying observed outcomes (Gouldner 1954; Katz  and Kahn 1966; Vlaar et al., 2006; Zollo and Singh 2004). This enhances the  ‘governability’ of interorganizational relationships (Clegg et al. 2002a; Rose and  Miller 1992). Finally, formalization propels learning processes, including the  maintenance of existing knowledge, the improvement of previous know-how,  and the creation of totally new knowledge (Avadikyan et al. 2001). It not only  acts as a target for contraction (Stinchcombe 2001; Zollo and Singh 2004), but  also entails mind stretching, possibly resulting in new insights, ideas and strate-  gies (Kale et al. 2001; Kotabe et al. 2003; Vlaar et al., 2006).  444 Organization Studies 28(04)   © 2007 SAGE Publications.

Scientific inquiries  have particularly emphasized formalization’s retarding effect on creativity and  innovation, and its role in inhibiting the flexibility that is needed for coping with  complex, ambiguous and unstable task environments (Mintzberg 1994;  Nooteboom 1999; Volberda 1998). Formalization has also been argued to stifle  mutual accommodations (Ireland et al. 2002), and to limit opportunities for  adaptation (Nooteboom 1999). Furthermore, it has been found to increase the  extent to which conflicts arise and to reduce partners’ commitment to relation-  ships (Jap and Ganesan 2000). In addition, formalization is known to entail the  risk of reducing performance and aspirations to minimum standards (Gouldner  1954; Katz and Kahn 1966), and to limit the scope for initiatives beyond those  specified in agreements (Hendry 2002). Balogun and Johnson (2004: 532), for  example, found that the introduction of contracts in cooperative endeavours  sometimes made things worse, ‘with individuals only doing exactly what was  specified and nothing else’. Formalization may then gradually degenerate into  formalism (Mintzberg 1994; Scott 2003).  Moreover, in case formalization incorporates extrinsic incentives, this may  lead to reduced intrinsic motivation experienced by the cooperating parties  (Fehr and Falk 2002; Kreps 1997). In addition, formalization entails the risk  that areas of unilateral dependence (Lusch and Brown 1996; Macneil 1980) and  hold-up problems arise (Klein et al. 1978), while formalization’s efficacy may  be questioned when the costs of composing formalities, their necessary incom-  pleteness (Williamson 1985) and the limited opportunities for enforcement are  taken into account (Masten 1996; Stinchcome 2001). Finally, the advantageous-  ness of formalization may be diminished by issues such as short-termism, inter-  departmental and interorganizational strife, and data manipulation (Marginson  and Ogden 2005). Goals set in formal documents, for example, sometimes give  rise to unethical behaviour, including overstatement and false claiming of  accomplishments (Schweitzer et al. 2004).  Part of the functions and dysfunctions of formalization described here may  only surface over time, because contracts, rules and procedures assume the  character of an interorganizational memory (De Boer et al. 1999; Mayer and  Argyres 2004). Formalization can, for example, enable coordination in later  stages of cooperation by reducing relationships’ vulnerability to fallible memo-  ries and to the turnover of personnel (De Rond 2003). It may also facilitate  learning in other relationships, as formal documents are transferred relatively  easily to novel relationships (Kale et al. 2001).  Illustrative Case Study of the STEADY–QUICK Alliance  The case study exemplifies how the dialectic perspective on formalization that  is central to this paper complements more traditional, deterministic perspectives  Vlaar et al: Towards a Dialectic Perspective 445   © 2007 SAGE Publications.

It concerns an interorganizational relationship between a  large global retailer, STEADY, and a European-based financial services firm,  QUICK. This case has been selected for three reasons. First, the size of both  parent firms in terms of employees and turnover was large, which increased the  likelihood that formalization would be an issue in the alliance (Zeffane 1989).  Second, both companies offered us unique access to the enormous amount of  documentation that was produced during the relationship, and to their employ-  ees. Finally, the alliance required innovative activities. Coupled with the poten-  tially high demands for formalization — arising from firm sizes, and the  legitimacy, accountability and control required for financial services (Vermeulen  2001) — this increased the likelihood that tensions would arise from the coex-  istence of formalization’s functions and dysfunctions.  Data Collection  The most important data collection characteristics are captured in Appendix 1.  We conducted 22 semi-structured interviews between June 2002 and July 2004.  Before doing so, an interview guideline was developed, which outlined the  issues that were to be explored and which served as a checklist during the inter-  views (McCracken 1988). The majority of the interviews took place with par-  ticipants from STEADY, as this firm employed the lion’s share of the 90 persons  working for the relationship. All but one of the interviews was tape-recorded  and subsequently transcribed verbatim, resulting in 458 pages of interview text.  Transcribed interviews were coded in QSR NUD*IST Vivo (see Bazeley and  Richards 2000).  During the data collection, descriptive and interpretive validity were secured  through tape-recording the interviews, producing verbatim transcriptions, and  performing accuracy checks with respondents. The reported findings were  reviewed and commented on during a workshop and in individual feedback-  meetings. Beyond interviews, extensive archival data were collected, including  743 documents containing service level agreements, project handbooks, reports,  memos, letters, web pages, annual reports, agendas, status reports and minutes  from alliance meetings. These additional sources of information facilitated the  triangulation of evidence (Eisenhardt 1989b; Strauss and Corbin 1998; Yin  1994). In analysing the data, we started with factual or descriptive coding (see  Strauss and Corbin 1998) in order to categorize text fragments in the interview  transcripts and documents along the functions and dysfunctions of formaliza-  tion that we distinguished in Tables 1 and 2. Text fragments pointing at trade-  offs made by participants in the relationship were categorized as ‘trade-offs’,  whereas indications of alliance managers’ attempts to cope with tensions  between formalization’s functions and dysfunctions were accumulated under  the category ‘tension management’. Text fragments hinting at the performance  of the relationship were coded under the category ‘interorganizational perfor-  mance’. Subsequently, we used axial coding procedures (see Strauss and Corbin  1998) to relate different categories and subcategories to each other. We then  developed a case narrative, in which we present interview fragments from var-  ious categories to illustrate the research framework.  446 Organization Studies 28(04)   © 2007 SAGE Publications.

Potential services related to the provision of savings accounts and insur-  ance packages. Complementarity between the partners’ resources seemed high,  with STEADY having a retail channel and a huge customer base, and QUICK  possessing a banking-licence, a back-office infrastructure and legitimacy as a  provider of financial services. Negotiations on the alliance began in March  1999. The first round, which led to a contract-frame, took around six months.  Drafting the complete contract absorbed almost a year. Although the presence  of lawyers sometimes led to polarization, negotiations were generally construc-  tive. Parallel to the negotiations, a business case and an interorganizational  structure were being developed by a group of eight persons, four from each  firm. The structure designed for the alliance is depicted in Figure 3. As can be  seen from the chart, the alliance was supervised by a reference group, while its  daily management was in the hands of the alliance managers of both firms.  Operational activities at STEADY, which primarily pertained to information  technology and marketing, were subdivided over six workgroups. As QUICK  needed to perform fewer activities, these were concentrated in one workgroup.

The alliance managers, service-level managers and several other  key stakeholders met each other at least four times a year in pre-scheduled  meetings, whereas most other participants had bilateral contacts with their  counterparts in the other firm at least once every week.  At the beginning of 2001, the first financial services were distributed through  STEADY’s shops. After one month, the alliance served almost 100,000 cus-  tomers. At the outset of 2003, this number had nearly tripled, leading STEADY’s  alliance manager to state that the alliance represented ‘the most successful intro-  duction of a new financial service in the last 10 years’ (Interview with alliance  manager STEADY, 4 June 2002). As can be seen from Appendix 2, most other  participants also evaluated the relationship’s performance positively. Following  this general introduction to the case study, we now illustrate how a dialectic per-  spective on formalization in interorganizational relationships, as it was described  in the framework that we presented earlier, complements more traditional, deter-  ministic perspectives.  From Firm, Transaction and Contextual Characteristics to Trade-offs  The interviewees referred to a large number of firm, transaction and contextual  characteristics that collectively invoked a relatively high need for formalization.  They pointed to, among other things, the internal organization of STEADY, which  already worked according to formal rules and procedures, the complexity of the  alliance, and the institutional context (e.g. Central Bank and regulatory bodies),  which demanded legitimate accounts of the activities undertaken in the alliance.  Nonetheless, the alliance managers of both firms indicated that the trade-offs that  they made were based on a small subset of the functions and dysfunctions that  were later attributed to formalization by themselves and other interviewees. They  primarily decided to sacrifice creativity and flexibility for a high pace of devel-  opment, and for certainty about the rigour and consistency with which work  would be carried out in the alliance, and expressed this as follows:  ‘Formalization removes creativity and flexibility from a project. That is the downside.  The upside is that it guaranteed that the things that we developed worked nearly fault-  lessly.’ (Interview with alliance manager QUICK, 28 January 2003)  ‘I think that to make sure a project proceeds at a certain pace, one has to be clear about  the desired outcomes … We had to formulate what we wanted and how the result should  look like. On the one hand, that infused speed in the project and simplified decision-  making to a large extent. On the other hand, it increased the risk that was taken by us as  commissioners, because if things went wrong, it would clearly be our problem.’  (Interview with alliance manager STEADY, 6 January 2003)  Degree of Formalization  During the alliance, both partners worked along formal lines and a standard-  methodology. They developed multiple business cases, conceptual designs,  impact-analyses, functional designs and technical designs. Documentation  from prior stages served as a basis for subsequent phases, and compatibility of  448 Organization Studies 28(04)   © 2007 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

It is hard  to assess to what extent formalization was due to managerial intentionality and  to what extent it reflected the context of the alliance, as both are intricately  related. The fact that formalization was relatively high and that this had its ori-  gins in firm, transaction and contextual characteristics as well as managerial  choice becomes obvious from comments issued by a CRM-analyst and by  STEADY’s alliance manager:  ‘They [formal procedures] are handled strictly. Also a functional design needs to be  signed by everybody. And even if somebody comes with a dodge or a trick that requires  adaptation, then these things need to be changed very formally, via change requests.’  (Interview with CRM-analyst, 18 November 2002)   ‘Of course it started rather vaguely, but it entered a funnel and became more and more  formalized and structured.’ (Interview with alliance manager STEADY, 5 August 2002)  ‘This formal approach has been partly instigated by the IT-organization. They said: this  is how we want it. This is the best way to work for us, especially as this will become a  complex project.’’ (Interview with alliance manager STEADY, 5 August 2002)  Participants from QUICK were not used to acting in such a formal way, but their  experience with STEADY’s approach, combined with the intention to transform  QUICK into a customer-oriented organization, gradually led them to adopt a more  formal working style. This hints at the co-evolution of partner firms and interor-  ganizational relationships (Koza and Lewin 1998; Lewin and Volberda 1999;  Volberda and Lewin 2003), something that is supported by participants from  QUICK:  ‘Because I came from QUICK, I was working very ad hoc myself and I paid little atten-  tion to recording things; just the things I thought that they were really important.  Because of the alliance, I have started to record and describe everything. If anything is  added, an instruction is made for it, or an education plan is being developed … I have  adopted a lot of the working practices of STEADY.’ (Interview with customer service  manager, 3 December 2002)  ‘And it has led to a little more formalization of things. Nowadays, we have agreed on  certain procedures, which people have to comply with. You see that the organization is  maturing. The realization that that was necessary has arisen during the alliance.  STEADY has been the trigger for that.’ (Interview with process and systems analyst, 12  December 2002)  Functions of Formalization  Other participants in the alliance emphasized different functions and dysfunc-  tions of formalization than those included in the trade-offs made by the alliance  managers. Following Tables 1 and 2, each of these will be discussed briefly.  Formalization’s coordination function became apparent from the fact that for-  mal documents accompanied the division of labour between different work-  groups in the relationship, serving as input for socialization between them. A  comment from the project leader for central IT applications is illustrative:  ‘After you have made a functional design, it is sent to both the builders and the testers.  The testers then define their test cases, while the builders are building the applications at  the same time.’ (Interview with project leader central applications, 21 November 2002)  Vlaar et al: Towards a Dialectic Perspective 449   © 2007 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved. Not for commercial use or unauthorized distribution.   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 21, 2008 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   Related to this, the formal structure adopted in the alliance reduced the complex-  ity that was perceived by participants in the relationship, as these needed to  ‘solve’ smaller parts of the ‘problems’ that had to be tackled. This became evident  from the response of a project leader when he was asked whether he regarded the  alliance to be complex or not:  ‘Complex? No, not really. Because the structure was well devised, it actually was not as  complex as it seemed. The structure was really good.’ (Interview with project leader  infrastructures, 15 November 2002)   Formalization’s control function appeared in the form of monitoring progress  and preventing frequent stretching of the scope of the alliance. This became  obvious from a remark by QUICK’s service-level manager:  ‘One has to prevent looking backwards by making a list of decisions made. One has to  look forward by means of an action list. If you keep those sharp, things proceed.’  (Interview with service-level manager, 8 November 2002)  At the same time, the project leader for retail systems indicated that a higher  level of formalization by QUICK at the beginning of the relationship would  have increased STEADY’s trust in its partner:  ‘The status [progress] was verbally communicated, but was not supported by documents  that were put on the table, from which it became evident that that was really the status.  That would have helped. There would have been less distrust then. It was easy to say: we  are now at this stage, and in two weeks things are finished.’ (Interview with project  leader retail systems, 15 December 2002)  Formalization functioned as a means to increase the internal and external legit-  imacy of the relationship as well. Within the alliance, the mere existence of for-  malities legitimized rule observation, whereas detailed documentation helped in  legitimizing the relationship towards governmental bodies, witnessing a com-  ment of STEADY’s service-level manager:  ‘I suspect that the detailed documentation has helped to win institution X over. We said:  “Listen, have a look at how precisely we deal with these things.” I think that has helped.’  (Interview with service-level manager STEADY, 11 November 2002)  Concerning cognition and learning, formalization enabled partners to set  expectations, and to clarify implicit assumptions. It lay bare potential conflicts  and tempered extreme confidence in the alliance (see also Sampson 2003), as  is illustrated by comments from a project leader and an in-company legal  counsellor:  ‘At the moment you make your plan, you try to limit uncertainties. You describe the  things that you do not know for certain, possibly with alternative directions for solutions  … If you do not do that, you can be certain that the final product will not become what  everybody expects.’ (Interview with project leader central applications, 21 November  2002)  ‘Just put it on the table and discuss it. Then you avoid a lot of problems in the future. By  putting it on paper you pave the way for good cooperation. It enables you to estimate  what issues you will be confronted with, and how these need to be resolved. Furthermore,  it makes clear what you expect from each other. I think many people do not realize that.’  (Interview with in-company legal advisor, 30 January 2003)  450 Organization Studies 28(04)   © 2007 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved. Not for commercial use or unauthorized distribution.   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 21, 2008 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   Moreover, remarks by one of STEADY’s project leaders and its alliance man-  ager hinted at the supportive role of formalization in enabling contraction, and  in making sure that specifications were complete, accurate and consistent:  ‘Many documents have been produced here, which have led us to state: that should be  included for subsequent projects!’’ (Interview with project-leader infrastructure, 15  November 2002).  ‘The good side is that they [formal documents and procedures] kept us sharp with respect  to the accuracy and completeness of the specifications.’ (Interview with alliance manager  STEADY, 6 February 2004)  Besides, formal processes fuelled the interaction between participants in the  relationship. According to the project leader of the administrative organization,  formalities functioned as simultaneously enabling and constraining structures,  which triggered debate among participants in the relationship.  ‘During the process it worked as a red line from one meeting to another meeting: to mea-  sure progress, to provide a kind of glue, and to communicate to others within the meet-  ings. In my opinion, it is just for the process: keeping everybody on one line. Also to  inform people and to record what should happen.’ (Interview with project leader admin-  istrative organization, 21 November 2002)  Finally, formalization had several positive consequences in the long-run. It  functioned, among others, as a memory device, reducing the vulnerability of the  alliance to personnel turnover and fallible memories:  ‘My experience is that if you do not produce action lists, lots of things disappear. Because  (a) persons forget things, and (b) after a week you might remember that you need to do  something, but you possibly have a different interpretation of the task than at the moment  at which the issue originated.’ (Interview with service-level manager QUICK, 8 November  2002)  ‘The documentation warrants knowledge preservation, which is electronically accessible  and on which people can build in a following project. Because people leave … you name  it … Those are not stable factors.’ (Interview with service-level manager STEADY, 11  November 2002)  Dysfunctions of Formalization  Respondents also pointed at several dysfunctions of formalization. First,  employees from STEADY used formalization to cover themselves against all  kinds of risks. This resulted in stiffened and rigid relations between its IT-  departments and its business department, witnessing quotes from STEADY’s  business commissioner and one of QUICK’s process and systems analysts:  ‘Employees from STEADY keep their own alley clean. They are very precise. That becomes  obvious when one considers the fact that they record everything in the minutes. One can also  read between the lines in the progress-reports. They put problems aside, on the plates of oth-  ers. Moreover, they connect problems to choices that have been made by others … They also  have a standard list with the risks of the project, from which you can percolate exactly how  they try to cover themselves.’ (Interview with alliance manager STEADY, 6 January 2003)  ‘When there was a hitch in the cable, people at STEADY sometimes tried to keep their  own alley clean … At QUICK we say, some things go wrong and you have to solve them,  but that can happen. I had the impression that they thought, they cut our heads off, if  Vlaar et al: Towards a Dialectic Perspective 451   © 2007 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved. Not for commercial use or unauthorized distribution.   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 21, 2008 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   something goes wrong. I have to make sure that it is not my fault.’ (Interview with  process and systems analyst, 12 December 2002)  Another negative consequence of formalization consisted of the administrative  burden it brought along and the time it consumed. Eventually, this almost turned  formalization from a means towards an end in itself. Comments from the gen-  eral IT project manager and the CRM manager are illustrative:  ‘The vision is lacking with respect to why something is formalized. It has to be done like  this because somebody says that it should be done like this.’ (Interview with general IT-  manager, 6 January 2003)  ‘One saw tension at STEADY, where behaviour was very formal. They did not give any  space to think about something when it had been previously defined. Exaggerating it a  bit, it was as follows: Why do you do it like this? We do it like this, because it is like this  on paper. Not because it is best, but because it is written on paper. So, we do it like this.’  (Interview with CRM-analyst, 18 November 2002)   Coping with Tensions  The alliance managers attempted to prevent and cope with the tensions arising  from the coexistence of formalization’s functions and dysfunctions in three  ways. First, they developed a kind of semi-structure (Brown and Eisenhart,  1997), in which some features were prescribed or determined, but others were  not. Meyer and Rowan (1977) provide an example of such a semi-structure,  indicating that hospitals and schools have highly specific and rigid rules of  administration, while the professionals working in them may have a high degree  of freedom in how they approach their work. Analogously, syndicates in the  venture capital industry adopt investment agreements that enshrine the rights  and obligations of participants, but hardly specify behaviour (Wright and  Lockett 2003). Such an approach provides people with arenas for action, while  it leaves the specific means to achieve outcomes open, enabling an improvised  and energized flow of activities (Dougherty and Takacs 2004). This approach  was also evident in the alliance, where objectives, goals and expected outcomes  were codified and enforced strictly, whereas employees were granted consider-  able latitude in how to accomplish these. STEADY’s alliance manager  explained why they adopted such a semi-structure:  ‘The role that one chooses as a commissioner is either having them do their work as they  wish it themselves, with their own control and consultation structures, and planning-  cycles. In that case, you only provide input as to what you want them to realize [outcome  formalization]. Or you also stand as a kind of project manager, prescribing how they  have to work [process formalization]. We have not done the latter, because you will not  succeed in doing this with two persons. So we had them use their own working and plan-  ning methods, while providing them with input, telling them what we wanted the output  to look like … If you provide them with limited freedom concerning what they should  do, then you should not also interfere with how they do that, with how they should struc-  ture that process. That will take away all the fun they have in managing such a project.’  (Interview with alliance manager STEADY, 6 January 2003)  This finding conflicts with assertions of Koza and Lewin (1998: 260) that, ‘ceteris  paribus, the greater the exploration intent of an alliance, the greater the reliance  on behaviour and process controls’. As contingencies are hard to identify in  452 Organization Studies 28(04)   © 2007 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved. Not for commercial use or unauthorized distribution.   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 21, 2008 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   advance and because this type of relationships requires mutual adaptation, behav-  ioural control is inappropriate (Carson et al. 2006; Madhok and Tallman 1998). It  takes away the ability of individuals to exercise their judgment (Goold and Quinn  1990), reduces their motivation, and results in boredom, alienation, job dissatis-  faction and diminished output (Nygaard and Dahlstrom 2002).  Second, the alliance managers tried to cope with the tensions between for-  malization’s functions and dysfunctions by referring to factors that were beyond  their control, such as demands imposed by their own supervisors or regulatory  institutions, and the enormous impact that ‘mistakes’ would have on the reputa-  tion and image of both organizations. They thus attempted to persuade and con-  vince others to work along formal lines by accentuating the external constraints  imposed on the alliance instead of underlining their own preferences for little  interference of pressure groups, or their desire to have everyone work accord-  ing to their own plans, which is congruent with work from Shaw et al. (2003)  and Sitkin and Bies (1993). The following comments hint in this direction:  ‘Before any money is spent, the board wants to know in broad lines what the plan is and  what the financial consequences are. Ideally, they also want to be able to shoot three out  of four plans.’ (Interview with alliance manager STEADY, 6 January 2003)  ‘We have a stick behind the door, because we are a bank now. So, many things cannot  be discussed anymore, but simply have to happen.’ (Interview with alliance manager  STEADY, 6 January 2003)  ‘Everyone realized that nothing should go wrong. We could not afford to lose money  which was put in a savings account ... That has to happen once or twice and you are on  the front-page of a national newspaper and you have a serious problem.’ (Interview with  alliance manager QUICK, 28 January 2003)  Under the guise of demands from supervisory boards, reference groups and  external institutions, and by adducing the magnitude of image risks, the alliance  managers were able to maintain high levels of formalization and forestall the  development of insurmountable tensions at the same time. This finding com-  plements results from earlier studies on justification and persuasion as influence  tactics adopted in mergers (Steensma and Milligen 2003) and during the imple-  mentation of auditing systems (Walgenbach 2001).  Finally, they used differences in the degree of formalization to which both  organizations were accustomed to propagate speed in certain areas and stages  of collaboration, and to enhance control in others. Although dissimilar levels of  formalization at parent organizations are generally believed to hamper cooper-  ation (Lane and Lubatkin 1998), the opposite occurred in this alliance. When  QUICK was not working thoroughly and accurately enough, STEADY’s per-  formance standards and codification requirements were emphasized. In situa-  tions in which participants from STEADY were moving too slowly, they were  confronted with the fact that their progress was far behind that of QUICK, as  expressed by one of the alliance managers.  ‘I think that the dissimilarity between the two firms eventually ensured that the project  became a success. They were used to a completely different way of working. There was  much more entrepreneurial spirit in the blood of participants from QUICK compared to  those from STEADY. Persons from STEADY, instead, had a much stronger instigation to  have everything documented, reported and crystallized out up to the final detail, compared  Vlaar et al: Towards a Dialectic Perspective 453   © 2007 SAGE Publications.

And this is what happened … We sometimes have, con-  sciously or unconsciously played these characteristics of the two parties off against each  other. I certainly did it myself, as I had to take care of QUICK living up to its promises.  I regularly went to people from QUICK to say: “Guys, it’s all okay what you are doing,  but I want to have it on paper, because I cannot go to STEADY with this piece of paper.  If you do that here, that is all right with me, but this is an external party, so the standard  needs to be raised”. If we needed something done, we could use QUICK to convey  strength and speed towards STEADY, whereas STEADY was more of a controlling and  auditing master.’ (Interview with alliance manager QUICK, 28 January 2003)  Managerial action thus reduced the likelihood that vicious circles were formed,  in which either the functions or dysfunctions of formalization received exacer-  bating attention (see also Volberda 1998). By recognizing the dangers inherent  in taking extreme positions on the formalization continuum, and by prolifically  capitalizing on the tensions at intermediary positions, the alliance managers  tried to amplify interorganizational performance.  Discussion  The case study, which has been analysed along the framework presented in  Figure 2, exemplifies that a dialectic perspective on formalization offers a valu-  able complement to the mainstream literature. It shows that formalization entails  a duality, which requires managers to make trade-offs and manage dialectic ten-  sions. In the case study, managers attempted to deal with this duality by: (1)  applying semi-structures in which either outcomes or behaviour are formalized;  (2) justifying particular levels of formalization by referring to factors that appear  to be beyond their control, and; (3) alternating their emphasis on different for-  malization requirements by each of the partner firms.  Although one could argue that our conclusions may have been driven by ret-  rospective sensemaking and by the attribution of success to managerial action  instead of external events (e.g. see Kelley and Michaela 1980; Weick 1995),  several factors reduce the likelihood that this was actually the case. First, in our  interview transcripts, we found several comments that clearly suggested that  managerial intentionality played a significant role with respect to formalization  in the alliance. One of the alliance managers, for example, mentioned that   ‘it was the conviction of the director of STEADY that the company should pursue inno-  vative projects in a more systematic and formal way, as the lack of a professional  approach in similar projects had led to failure before.’ (interview alliance manager  STEADY, 8 August 2002).   Second, we also found more ‘objective’ support for some of the means that were  used by the alliance managers to suppress potential tensions. Regarding their fre-  quent referrals to requirements set by external institutions, for example, we note  that the minutes of a general alliance meeting of 3 September 1999 already men-  tioned that ‘the Central Bank approved the concept-design for the alliance’, and  that the report that was conferred to and approved of by the Central Bank ‘would  function as a basis for the relationship’. This suggests that there was no reason to  stress the demands of the Central Bank during the remainder of the relationship to  454 Organization Studies 28(04)   © 2007 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved. Not for commercial use or unauthorized distribution.   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 21, 2008 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   a greater extent than the points of attention reflected in this report. Nonetheless,  more than 70% of the interviewees advanced the requirements of regulating bod-  ies and the Central Bank as an important motive for formalization. In this respect,  the alliance manager of QUICK stated that he may have   ‘frightened the participants in the alliance too much in the beginning. Particularly due to  the fact that the Central Bank consisted of unknown territory for most participants in the  alliance, they may have thought that it was better to raise the degree of formalization  instead of reducing it.’ (Interview with alliance manager QUICK, 28 January 2003)  Third, some of the interviewees of STEADY experienced large problems with  the alliance managers, which reduced the likelihood that they would incorrectly  attribute success to their actions. Nonetheless, these interviewees still credited  the alliance managers for the structure and the degree of formalization that was  adopted in the relationship, and for the way in which they coped with the result-  ing tensions. The general IT-manager, for example, indicated that a misunder-  standing between him and the alliance managers ‘escalated in such a way that  they had to defend each other’s viewpoints in front of the direction of  STEADY’. At the same time, this manager praised the ability of the alliance  managers to ‘set expectations’ and to ‘keep the alliance going in case problems  arose’ (Interview with overall IT-manager, 6 January 2003).  Theoretical and Practical Implications  Our research has several significant implications for research on formalization  in interorganizational relationships. First, it suggests that formalization can no  longer be depicted as being solely determined by firm, transaction and contex-  tual characteristics. It also appears to be contingent on the extent to which man-  agers anticipate the functions and dysfunctions of formalization, and on the  appropriateness of the trade-offs that they make. The case study shows that  these trade-offs may be preceded by limited considerations of the entire array  of functions and dysfunctions of formalization that may eventually occur in  such relationships. In our case, the alliance managers particularly made little  reference to (sub-)functions of formalization that seem harder to anticipate,  such as ‘forcing people to reflect and think’, and those factors that may affect  performance in more remote futures, such as ‘the use of formal documents as  an interorganizational memory’. This may be the result of bounded rationality  and limited foresight, but it may also derive from a lack of knowledge of and  experience with formalization, or from the organizational position of alliance  managers. Trade-offs may be biased, for example, towards managers’ own,  immediate needs. Furthermore the case study illustrates that alliance managers  may not only be preoccupied with making the ‘right’ governance choices, but  also, and perhaps primarily with the trade-offs and tensions that respectively  precede and follow them. This underscores the significance of the managerial  action involved with structuring choices, and it suggests that the relationship  between formalization and performance as it is frequently proposed in the liter-  ature, in the form of an inverted U-shape (e.g. Luo 2002), is probably affected  by managers’ abilities to cope with dialectic tensions.

Not for commercial use or unauthorized distribution.   at Erasmus Univ Rotterdam on January 21, 2008 http://oss.sagepub.comDownloaded from   A second theoretical implication concerns the functions that can be attributed  to formalization (see Table 1), which are more diverse than generally acknowl-  edged in the literature. More specifically, we propose that theoretical explana-  tions for observed levels of formalization should not only focus on its  ‘coordination’ and ‘control’ functions (e.g. Foss and Foss 2005; Gulati and  Singh 1998; Madhok 2002), but also on its relationships with ‘legitimacy’ and  ‘cognition and learning’ (see Vlaar et al. 2006). These functions may help to  explain why, despite a changing and probably more turbulent environment, for-  malization is still endemic in modern business (Hatch 1999). Moreover, their  coexistence suggests that monocausal explanations for interorganizational  structuring efforts based on single theoretical lenses are likely to be inappropri-  ate (Adler 1993; Klein Woolthuis et al. 2005). The managerial implications of  our study concern managers’ awareness and understanding of the numerous  functions and dysfunctions through which formalization influences interorgani-  zational performance (see Tables 1 and 2), and their inclination to apply a  dialectic management style. This article shows that managers can ameliorate  interorganizational performance by simultaneously holding and exploring  opposing views (Eisenhardt 2000) and by capitalizing on the tensions emanat-  ing from interorganizational governance solutions.  Limitations and Future Research  We have depicted formalization as being the result of trade-offs by alliance  managers and other participants in interorganizational relationships, and we  have suggested that formalization may be an emergent process, or a requirement  imposed by higher management (see Ring et al. 2005). This indicates a need for  research on the extent to which the degree of formalization applied in interor-  ganizational relationships is affected by organizational positions and bargaining  processes between stakeholders. In addition, we illustrated the relevance of a  more managerial perspective on formalization in interorganizational relation-  ships with only one case study, which restricts the external validity of our study.  Our data do not permit us to assess to what degree formalization and its rela-  tionship with interorganizational performance are influenced by managerial  choice. We therefore encourage researchers to combine questionnaire and inter-  view techniques to study traditional and dialectic perspectives side by side.  Finally, as the consequences of (not) instituting formalities may differ for vari-  ous stages of cooperation (Cardinal et al. 2004), future research needs to  address the timing of formalization, and potential variations in emphasis on dif-  ferent functions during the evolution of alliances.  Conclusion  We started this paper by asking how our view on the role of formalization  in interorganizational relationships would change, if more attention was paid  to managerial choice. To address this question, we complemented traditional,  relatively deterministic perspectives on formalization with a view in which  456 Organization Studies 28(04)   © 2007 SAGE Publications.

The  coexistence of formalization’s functions and dysfunctions, it was argued, entail  trade-offs and dialectic tensions. We illustrated such a dialectic perspective on  formalization with a case study of a cross-industrial strategic alliance, and we  exemplified how managers of interorganizational relationships may diminish  the tensions stemming from formalization or convert them into productive  forces. By doing so, we have shown that a dialectic perspective on formaliza-  tion in interorganizational relationships offers a promising complement to the  mainstream literature on this topic. In particular, we have elucidated that  researchers and managers should not only be preoccupied with the ‘rightness’  of governance structures, but also, and perhaps primarily, with the trade-offs  and dialectic tensions associated with them.  This research has benefited from inspiring discussions with Paul Adler, Africa Ariño, Pieter-Jan  Bezemer, Charles Baden-Fuller, Justin Jansen, and Rosalinde Klein Woolthuis. We are also grate-  ful for the comments issued by several attendees of the 65th Academy of Management Conference  and for the valuable suggestions provided by senior editor T. K.

So if you see how the project is put up [...]. The way in which we have  knocked together this infrastructure is simply magnificent […]. Other com-  panies [names have been deleted] would have spend an amount of money  that is probably tenfold as high’.   End-result: ‘It is very positive that a system has been developed that is rea-  sonably bug-proof. In other words, that everything has been gone through in  a structured way and that with respect to IT-issues no or hardly any problems  came up at STEADY’.  End-result: ‘It resulted in a very stable, robust, reliable environment, that  does what is should do. I am quite happy about that. And you also see that  when considering disturbances’.   Creating an image of uniqueness and innovativeness: ‘A lot has been written  about it, and it has raised a lot of dust. I think that has contributed to  STEADY’s image of renewal. It has shown once again that it is an innovative  company that can create an innovative product within a short period of time’.  Enhancing customer loyalty: ‘Of course it also fits within the strategy of one-  stop-shopping, in which you provide a total package and the client does not  need to go to other firms. The client does everything in one hand. He can save,  shop, and withdraw money. On the basis of that strategy it fits perfectly well’.  Improving efficiency: ‘A positive point is that we now have the possibility to  enhance the efficiency of processes related to the loyalty program of  STEADY. They become cheaper, and faster.’  Difficulty to imitate: ‘This product can not be copied. If you take a bag of  potatoes, and you make a good price, it is easily copied by a competitor. This  is much more difficult to copy’.  Possibility of sequel products: ‘What also makes it interesting is that sequel  products could be introduced in a short period of time, that enable you to cre-  ate additional turnover and margin on few square meters’.   Expectations not completely met: ‘The market is more difficult. Interest  rates have come done to a level at which saving is not regarded to be attrac-  tive. Our competitive position has become worse, because of the high inter-  est rates of our competitors. But they sacrifice profits. That influences the  flow of new customers’.   Loss of productivity: ‘With the current means that we have at the cash reg-  ister, it means that we encounter some productivity losses’.    © 2007 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

I have to say that as a consumer I also think each  time ‘ah, shit’.  Project-management: ‘In terms of project management the final result can be  called a success, because it suffices the demanded functionality and specifi-  cations. We have produced what was requested’.  Experience spin-off: ‘The knowledge and experience that we have built up  to do this enable us to do similar projects faster and cheaper in future […]. I  think we have learned a lot from this alliance. For example, that you need to  improve communication, put things down in writing, and come to agree-  ments before you start. That is what we have learned from it and what we  now do in another project’.  Data-encryption spin-off: ‘The knowledge that has been built up with respect  to data encryption is now possibly deployed again. We are working on a new  project in which that also plays a role’.  Calibration of business cases spin-off: ‘we have acknowledged that there are  a couple of things which require more attention and better organization.  Calibration of business cases for instance… I am convinced that if the  alliance would not have taken place, other projects might have been started  that were doomed to fail. So that is a spin-off of not-effectuated investments  or costs that would not lead to successes’.  Processing spin-off: ‘In the framework of the alliance, the monitoring of the  processes in the nightly hours has become much more extensive than we  were used to within QUICK. And, as soon as you are monitoring, you do not  only do that for the alliance, but you can also signal when something goes  wrong within QUICK. So the monitoring of the systems has also improved  for QUICK’s transactions’.  Documentation spin-off: ‘that document-database is also being used within  a new project. So that is an advantage for other projects in similar joint ven-  tures or extensions of such ventures. We were very busy with standardizing  the documentation and there were no templates available at that time that ful-  filled our new demands’.  Interorganizational structure spin-off: ‘We will get more and more environ-  ments in which we have decoupling points and in which we have to work  together with partners in a rather intensive way. I see that happening in the  shops and we have started to develop a reasonable structure for that. And that  means that maneuvering becomes easier. At this point in time, we commu-  nicate with parking systems, sales machines, loyalty-organizations, QUICK,  online loyalty-servers, delivery services…. You develop a very organic envi-  ronment in which external partners can be connected easily’.   © 2007 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

The technology behind the  security modules is probably being used in a new cash register environment.  That is a global project. A few of the pieces written on programming are also  e-used within the loyalty environment’.

M. Mom, Frans A. J. van den Bosch, Henk W. Volberda  Department of Strategic Management and Business Environment, Rotterdam School of Management,  Erasmus University, 3000 DR Rotterdam, The Netherlands  {tmom@rsm.nl, fbosch@rsm.nl, hvolberda@rsm.nl}  P  revious research focuses on firm and business unit level ambidexterity. Therefore, conceptual and empirically validated  understanding about ambidexterity at the individual level of analysis is very scarce. This paper addresses this gap  in the literature by investigating managers’ ambidexterity, delivering three contributions to theory and empirical research  on ambidexterity: first, by proposing three related characteristics of ambidextrous managers; second, by developing a  model and associated hypotheses on both the direct and interaction effects of formal structural and personal coordination  mechanisms on managers’ ambidexterity; and third, by testing the hypotheses based on a sample of 716 business unit level  and operational level managers.  Findings regarding the formal structural mechanisms indicate that a manager’s decision-making authority positively  relates to this manager’s ambidexterity, whereas formalization of a manager’s tasks has no significant relationship with this  manager’s ambidexterity. Regarding the personal coordination mechanisms, findings indicate that both the participation of a  manager in cross-functional interfaces and the connectedness of a manager to other organization members positively relate  to this manager’s ambidexterity. Furthermore, results show positive interaction effects between the formal structural and  personal coordination mechanisms on managers’ ambidexterity. The paper’s theoretical contributions and empirical results  increase our understanding about managers’ ambidexterity and about how different types and combinations of coordination  mechanisms relate to variation in managers’ ambidexterity.  Key words : ambidexterity; manager level; coordination mechanisms; interaction effects  History : Published online in Articles in Advance April 27, 2009.  As current literature focuses on ambidexterity at the  business unit and firm level of analysis, conceptual and  empirically validated understanding about ambidexter-  ity at the individual level of analysis is very scarce  (Raisch and Birkinshaw 2008). Hence, scholars like  Gupta et al. (2006, p. 703) and Raisch and Birkinshaw  (2008, p. 397) suggest investigating ambidexterity at the  individual level of analysis as a promising direction for  future research. This paper addresses this gap in the liter-  ature by investigating managers’ ambidexterity. Existing  studies refer to ambidexterity as a firm’s or business  unit’s ability to combine exploration and exploitation  related activities (e.g. Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004,  O’Reilly and Tushman 2004). Based on these litera-  tures, we define ambidexterity at the manager level as  a manager’s behavioral orientation toward combining  exploration and exploitation related activities within a  certain period of time (cf. Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004,  p. 210; O’Reilly and Tushman 2004, p. 81; Tushman  and O’Reilly 1996, p. 24).  The relevance of investigating managers’ ambidex-  terity is emphasized by studies that discuss a firm’s  ability to become ambidextrous in terms of, for  instance, managers’ decision-making processes (Rivkin  and Siggelkow 2003), the extent to which managers  engage in routine and nonroutine activities (Adler et al.  1999), or managers’ collective and creative actions  (Sheremata 2000). In line with these authors, O’Reilly  and Tushman (2004, p. 81) conclude that “one of the  most important lessons is that ambidextrous organiza-  tions need ambidextrous senior teams and managers.”  These examples illustrate the importance of increased  understanding about ambidexterity at the manager level  of analysis and about what drives variation in managers’  ambidexterity.  Although some studies provide valuable examples of  managers’ ambidextrous behavior (e.g., O’Reilly and  Tushman 2004, Tushman and O’Reilly 1996), ambidex-  terity research at this level of analysis would benefit  from further conceptualization. We contribute to this  effort by proposing and clarifying three related charac-  teristics of ambidextrous managers: ambidextrous man-  agers host contradictions (Smith and Tushman 2005,  Tushman and O’Reilly 1996); they are multitaskers  (Birkinshaw and Gibson 2004, Floyd and Lane 2000);  and they both refine and renew their knowledge, skills,  812  Mom, van den Bosch, and Volberda: Understanding Variation in Managers’ Ambidexterity  Organization Science 20(4), pp. 812–828, © 2009 INFORMS 813  and expertise (Floyd and Lane 2000, Hansen et al. 2001,  Sheremata 2000).  The paper also delivers a contribution to our under-  standing about what drives variation in managers’  ambidexterity by developing a model and testing  hypotheses on the relations between managers’ ambidex-  terity and two generic types of coordination mech-  anisms, formal structural and personal coordination  mechanisms. Previous research indicates the importance  of these two types of coordination mechanisms as key  organizational elements that influence managers’ behav-  ior by shaping their relations and their interactions with  other individuals, groups, or organization units (e.g.,  Martinez and Jarillo 1989, Van De Ven et al. 1976).  The importance of both types of coordination mecha-  nisms is also reflected in the literature on ambidexterity  (Raisch and Birkinshaw 2008). Whereas some investiga-  tors highlight the importance of formal structural mech-  anisms for a firm’s pursuit of ambidexterity (e.g., Benner  and Tushman 2003, Duncan 1976), others illustrate the  importance of more personal relationships among orga-  nization members (e.g. Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004,  Sheremata 2000). Studies on coordination indicate that  different types of coordination mechanisms may differ-  ently affect organization members’ behavior (e.g., Daft  and Lengel 1986, Van De Ven et al. 1976). However,  much more remains to be understood about whether and  how the two different types of coordination mechanisms  differently relate to managers’ ambidexterity (Jansen  et al. 2006).  Several studies on ambidexterity argue that combining  different organizational elements may stimulate orga-  nization members’ ambidexterity, for example, combin-  ing “hard elements” and “soft elements” (Gibson and  Birkinshaw 2004, p. 213) or combining “centrifugal” and  “centripetal” elements (Sheremata 2000). However, both  conceptual and empirically validated insight on the com-  bined effect of such different organizational elements on  ambidexterity is scarce (Raisch and Birkinshaw 2008,  Rivkin and Siggelkow 2003). To contribute to this issue  both theoretically and empirically, we will develop and  test hypotheses not only on the direct relations between  both types of coordination mechanisms and managers’  ambidexterity but also on the interaction effects between  the two types of mechanisms. With respect to the interac-  tion effects, Raisch and Birkinshaw (2008, p. 399) explic-  itly suggest that “future research could formally develop  and test propositions on how different antecedents inter-  act and complement one another in a firm’s pursuit of  organizational ambidexterity.”  Summarizing, this paper aims to deliver three con-  tributions to the literature on ambidexterity: first, by  proposing and clarifying three related characteristics of  ambidextrous managers by integrating insights from pre-  vious studies; second, by developing a model and asso-  ciated hypotheses on both direct and interaction effects  of formal structural and personal coordination mecha-  nisms on managers’ ambidexterity; and third, by testing  the hypotheses based on a sample of 716 managers. In  the next section, we elaborate on the concept of man-  agers’ ambidexterity and develop the model and asso-  ciated hypotheses. The methods section provides details  about the sample, data collection, and the development  and validation of the measurement instrument. Next we  present the empirical findings and conclude with a dis-  cussion of the results, implications, and issues for further  research.  Theory and Hypotheses  Managers’ Ambidexterity  Based on reviewing and integrating insights from  previous studies we propose the following three  related characteristics of ambidextrous managers: First,  ambidextrous managers host contradictions (Smith and  Tushman 2005, Tushman and O’Reilly 1996). That is,  they have the motivation and ability to be sensitive to,  to understand, and to pursue a range of seemingly con-  flicting opportunities, needs, and goals (O’Reilly and  Tushman 2004). Related to this, previous research points  out the need for ambidextrous managers to deal with  conflict (Duncan 1976, Floyd and Lane 2000) and to  engage in paradoxical thinking (Gibson and Birkinshaw  2004, Smith and Tushman 2005). Examples from the  literature that illustrate this characteristic indicate that  ambidextrous managers search for new market needs and  technological opportunities while also being sensitive to  reinforce existing product-market positions (Burgelman  2002, Tushman and O’Reilly 1996); they both elaborate  on existing goals, beliefs, and decisions and reconsider  these (cf. Ghemawat and Ricart I Costa 1993, Rivkin and  Siggelkow 2003); and they have both a short-term and a  long-term orientation towards identifying and pursuing  opportunities (O’Reilly and Tushman 2004).  Second, ambidextrous managers are multitaskers; i.e.,  they fulfill multiple roles and conduct multiple differ-  ent tasks within a certain period of time (Birkinshaw  and Gibson 2004, p. 45; Floyd and Lane 2000).  Related to this, authors indicate that ambidextrous man-  agers are more generalists rather than more specialists  (Birkinshaw and Gibson 2004, Leana and Barry 2000).  The literature illustrates this characteristic by indicating  that ambidextrous managers fulfill multiple roles related  to both competence deployment and competence defi-  nition activities (Floyd and Lane 2000, Sanchez et al.  1996), conduct both routine and nonroutine activities  (Adler et al. 1999), carry out both creative and collec-  tive actions (Sheremata 2000), and typically act outside  the narrow confines of their own job (Adler et al. 1999,  Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004).  Third, ambidextrous managers both refine and renew  their knowledge, skills, and expertise (Floyd and Lane  Mom, van den Bosch, and Volberda: Understanding Variation in Managers’ Ambidexterity  814 Organization Science 20(4), pp. 812–828, © 2009 INFORMS  2000, Hansen et al. 2001, Sheremata 2000). Related  to this, prior research indicates the importance for  ambidextrous managers to acquire and process differ-  ent kinds of knowledge and information (Floyd and  Lane 2000, Sheremata 2000). Examples from the liter-  ature illustrate that ambidextrous managers engage in  both reliability-enhancing and variety-increasing learn-  ing activities (Holmqvist 2004, McGrath 2001), process  and acquire both explicit and tacit knowledge (Lubatkin  et al. 2006, Nonaka and Konno 1998), and engage in  both local and distant search for knowledge and infor-  mation within their network of contacts (Hansen et al.  2001, Subramaniam and Youndt 2005).  Direct Impact of Formal Structural Coordination  Mechanisms on Managers’ Ambidexterity  Formal structural coordination mechanisms are one  of the most important mechanisms for coordinating  activities. We focus in this study on decentralization and  formalization because these emerge most consistently  in studies of the components of the formal structure  (Miller and Dröge 1986). Furthermore, by focusing on  decentralization and formalization, we follow other stud-  ies that also investigate formal structural coordination  mechanisms (e.g., Jansen et al. 2006, Zmud 1982). To  investigate decentralization at the manager level of anal-  ysis, we focus on a manager’s decision-making authority  (Ghoshal et al. 1994, Sheremata 2000). To investigate  formalization at the manager level of analysis, we focus  on the extent of formalization of a manager’s tasks, i.e.,  on the degree to which rules and codes describe a par-  ticular task, and the degree to which the manager has to  conform to the task description (Hage 1965, Pugh et al.  1963).  A Manager’s Decision-Making Authority. A man-  ager’s decision-making authority is about the extent to  which a manager has decision-making authority over  how and which tasks the manager performs and his or  her ability to solve problems and to set goals (Atuahene-  Gima 2003, Dewar et al. 1980). Increasing man-  agers’ decision-making authority increases their sense  of responsibility for how they conduct their tasks and  the performance of these tasks (Tushman and O’Reilly  1996, Zmud 1982). This stimulates their willingness  to become aware and recognize a larger diversity of  organizational, market, and technological opportunities  and needs and to become more sensitive to understand-  ing how to act upon these different opportunities and  needs (Miller 1987, Pierce and Delbecq 1977, Tushman  and O’Reilly 1996). For instance, studies indicate that  increasing managers’ decision-making authority triggers  them not only to focus on short-term needs and associ-  ated benefits but also to increasingly attend to opportuni-  ties that will define the future (Pierce and Delbecq 1977,  Zmud 1982) and to the associated long-term benefits  (Miller 1987, O’Reilly and Tushman 2004). Related to  this, others indicate that increasing managers’ decision-  making authority increases their urge to seek solutions  to problems both within and outside the framework of  the existing strategy and beliefs (Ghemawat and Ricart  I Costa 1993, Sheremata 2000).  Furthermore, increased decision-making authority  increases managers’ self control and ownership of tasks  and decisions (Hage and Aiken 1967, Tushman and  O’Reilly 1996), which enables them to act upon the  recognized diversity of opportunities and needs and to  actively pursue a range of diverse goals (O’Reilly and  Tushman 2004, p. 81), i.e., to act ambidextrously. As  Gibson and Birkinshaw (2004, p. 211) put it, increased  self control and ownership augments managers’ ability  “to make their own choices as to how they divide  their time between alignment- and adaptability-oriented  activities,” and it increases their aspiration to attain  to both efficiency and flexibility related goals (Adler  et al. 1999). Finally, due to increased decision-making  authority, managers have to rely more on their own skills  and expertise rather than on rules or the skills and exper-  tise of superiors (Hage and Aiken 1967). This increases  these managers’ motivation to refine their existing skills  and expertise as well as to develop new skills and exper-  tise (Crossan and Berdrow 2003, McGrath 2001, Floyd  and Lane 2000). These arguments suggest the following  hypothesis.  Hypothesis 1. A manager’s decision-making au-  thority will be positively related to this manager’s  ambidexterity.  Formalization of a Manager’s Tasks. Formalization of  a manager’s tasks refers to the degree to which rules  and codes describe a particular task; provide guides for  decision making; and provide guides for conveying deci-  sions, instructions, and information and the degree to  which the manager has to conform to the task descrip-  tion (Hage 1965, Pugh et al. 1963). Increasing for-  malization of managers’ tasks increases the possibility  that these managers become less receptive to decision-  making stimuli that are not monitored by formal sys-  tems (Cyert and March 1963). Hence, higher levels of  formalization are associated with singleness of purpose  (Pierce and Delbecq 1977); they decrease the range of  different opportunities and goals managers are likely to  pursue (Hage 1965, Miller 1987). This formalization is  negatively associated with their level of ambidexterity;  ambidextrous managers pursue a range of different goals  (Tushman and O’Reilly 1996) and “have the ability to  understand and be sensitive to the needs of very different  kinds of business” (O’Reilly and Tushman 2004, p. 81).  Moreover, for being able to pursue a range of differ-  ent goals and to deal with associated conflicts (Floyd  and Lane 2000), ambidextrous managers need to coop-  erate and to “combine their efforts” with other organi-  zation members (Birkinshaw and Gibson 2004, p. 49;  Mom, van den Bosch, and Volberda: Understanding Variation in Managers’ Ambidexterity  Organization Science 20(4), pp. 812–828, © 2009 INFORMS 815  Duncan 1976, p. 181). However, increasing formaliza-  tion of tasks increases managers’ sense of isolation  resulting from difficulties with comprehending the rela-  tionship between their tasks and a larger purpose (Organ  and Greene 1981). This may result in a reduced motiva-  tion to cooperate and combine efforts with others (Hage  and Aiken 1969, Pierce and Delbecq 1977). Increasing  formalization of managers’ tasks also necessitates that  they develop more expertise in a limited area (Hage  1965); it augments these managers’ level of specializa-  tion and their depth of knowledge within the confines of  the formalized tasks (Daft and Lengel 1986, Zander and  Kogut 1995). This reduces these managers’ ability to act  ambidextrously and to act outside the narrow confines of  their jobs (Adler et al. 1999). It also makes it more dif-  ficult for them to broaden their range of skills (Daft and  Lengel 1986), i.e., to be “more generalist” rather than  “more specialist” (Birkinshaw and Gibson 2004). These  arguments suggest the following hypothesis.  Hypothesis 2. Formalization of a manager’s tasks  will be negatively related to this manager’s ambidexterity.  Direct Impact of Personal Coordination  Mechanisms on Managers’ Ambidexterity  Besides formal structural coordination mechanisms, the  literature emphasizes the importance of “personal types”  (Cray 1984, p. 87) of coordination mechanisms. Such  coordination mechanisms comprise personal relation-  ships between organization members that typically cut  across organizational units and hierarchical levels and  include “direct contact, liaison roles, task forces, and  teams” (Galbraith 1973, p. 89; see also Egelhoff 1991,  Martinez and Jarillo 1989). Liaison roles, task forces,  and teams are more formal personal coordination mech-  anisms (Gupta and Govindarajan 2000) as compared to  direct contacts, which are more informal and volun-  tary modes of personal coordination (Tsai 2002). In this  study, we consider both types of personal relationships  by investigating participation in cross-functional inter-  faces by a manager, i.e., liaison roles, task forces, and  teams (cf. Gupta and Govindarajan 2000), and a man-  ager’s direct contacts in terms of the manager’s connect-  edness to other organization members (cf. Jaworski and  Kohli 1993).  Participation in Cross-Functional Interfaces by a  Manager. Cross-functional interfaces encompass lateral  integration mechanisms such as liaison personnel,  task forces, and teams (Galbraith 1973, Gupta and  Govindarajan 2000). Participation of managers in cross-  functional interfaces increases their cooperation with  other managers of different functions, units, and hierar-  chical levels (Galbraith 1973, Miller 1987). These other  managers are likely to differ in their relationship to the  firm’s existing strategy, goals, interests, time horizon,  core values, and emotional tone (Floyd and Lane 2000,  Whetten 1978). Hence, besides bringing in their own  specialized expertise, and besides representing the inter-  est of their own specific group, managers who partici-  pate in cross-functional interfaces also have to think and  act outside the narrow confines of their own job and  position; i.e., they have to understand and take into con-  sideration the interests, perspectives, beliefs, and values  of other managers (Duncan 1976, Floyd and Lane 2000,  Miller 1987).  Furthermore, cross-functional interfaces increase trust  between managers of differentiated units (Adler et al.  1999, Galbraith 1973), which is “a critical contextual  factor” for managers to “shift the tradeoff between effi-  ciency and flexibility” (Adler et al. 1999, p. 63). It creates  a supportive context for managers with different back-  grounds to cooperate and learn from each other (Gibson  and Birkinshaw 2004). Related to this, Duncan (1976)  points out that participation in cross-functional interfaces  enables managers’ ambidextrous behavior by allowing  them to confront and resolve conflicts regarding different  goals, needs, and interests between differentiated orga-  nizational units and hierarchical levels. Managers’ par-  ticipation in cross-functional interfaces also positively  relates to their ambidexterity by offering opportuni-  ties to exchange knowledge (Egelhoff 1991, Gupta and  Govindarajan 2000). Cross-functional interfaces offer  opportunities for managers to refine their existing knowl-  edge by acquiring knowledge that is related to their own  knowledge base. These interfaces serve, for instance,  as mechanisms to exchange knowledge and informa-  tion regarding best practices of related technologies, pro-  cesses, or markets, allowing managers to increase or  refine their skills and expertise in a limited or spe-  cialized area (Henderson and Cockburn 1994, Jansen  et al. 2005). At the same time, by participating in cross-  functional interfaces, managers renew their knowledge  base by acquiring new or unrelated knowledge from man-  agers with different expertise (Egelhoff 1991, Ghoshal  and Bartlett 1988). These arguments suggest the follow-  ing hypothesis.  Hypothesis 3. Participation in cross-functional in-  terfaces by a manager will be positively related to this  manager’s ambidexterity.  Connectedness of a Manager to Other Organization  Members. Connectedness of a manager relates to the  extent to which the manager is networked to other organi-  zation members across hierarchical levels and organiza-  tional units in terms of direct personal contacts (Jaworski  and Kohli 1993, Sheremata 2000). It refers to the size  of the manager’s network of direct contacts across hier-  archical levels and organizational units and to the pat-  tern of the manager’s network in terms of density (Jansen  et al. 2006, Jaworski and Kohli 1993, Sheremata 2000).  An increasing size of a manager’s network of direct con-  tacts across hierarchical levels and organizational units is  Mom, van den Bosch, and Volberda: Understanding Variation in Managers’ Ambidexterity  816 Organization Science 20(4), pp. 812–828, © 2009 INFORMS  associated with increasing possibilities for that manager  to identify and acquire knowledge for both exploration  and exploitation purposes (Hansen et al. 2001, p. 26;  Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998, p. 248; Subramaniam and  Youndt 2005). A manager may benefit from using net-  work contacts by acquiring new and diverse knowledge  to, for instance, develop new competences (Floyd and  Lane 2000), pursue radical innovations (Subramaniam  and Youndt 2005), or find innovative solutions to prob-  lems (Sheremata 2000). A manager may also benefit  from using network contacts by obtaining related and  complementary knowledge to, for instance, improve and  refine existing competences (Floyd and Lane 2000), pur-  sue incremental innovations (Subramaniam and Youndt  2005), or reinforce existing beliefs and decisions (Rivkin  and Siggelkow 2003).  Increasing levels of density of direct personal con-  tacts within a manager’s network is associated with  an increased ability by that manager to acquire and  understand complex and ambiguous knowledge from the  network contacts (Hansen et al. 2001) and to engage  in reciprocal, nonroutine information processing (Daft  and Lengel 1986, Egelhoff 1991). These characteristics  enable that manager to reduce equivocality surrounding  exploratory tasks (Daft and Lengel 1986; Lubatkin et al.  2006, p. 648). At the same time, increasing levels of  density within a network increases trust and cooperation  and decreases the likelihood of goal conflict within the  network (Adler and Kwon 2002, Rowley et al. 2000),  which benefits the exploitation of new knowledge and  the implementation of innovations (Jansen et al. 2005,  Sheremata 2000).  These arguments suggest that connectedness is pos-  itively related to a manager’s ambidextrous behavior.  However, beyond a moderate level, increasing levels of  a manager’s connectedness may have dampening effects  on that manager’s ambidexterity. Increasingly dense net-  works diffuse strong norms, establish shared behavioral  expectations, and create a dominant logic (Bettis and  Wong 2003, Miller 1993, Rowley et al. 2000). First, this  reduces managers’ openness to different opportunities,  needs, and perspectives (Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998),  which reduces their motivation and ability to host con-  tradictions (Smith and Tushman 2005). Second, it con-  strains managers to perform broad searches for acquir-  ing knowledge and information (Jansen et al. 2005),  which reduces their ability to both refine and renew  their knowledge base (Hansen et al. 2001, Sheremata  2000). Furthermore, a large and densely connected net-  work may decrease managers’ ability to engage in high  levels of both exploration and exploitation related activ-  ities because maintaining such a network requires time  and effort to stay in touch and interact with others  (Hansen et al. 2001, Uzzi 1997). Hansen et al. (2001),  for instance, show that maintaining a densely connected  network is associated with reduced speed and efficiency  in completing both explorative and exploitative projects.  These arguments suggest the following hypothesis.  Hypothesis 4. There will be an inverted U-shaped re-  lationship between connectedness of a manager to other  organization members and this manager’s ambidexterity.  Interaction Effects Between Formal Structural and  Personal Coordination Mechanisms  A Manager’s Decision-Making Authority and Partici-  pation in Cross-Functional Interfaces. As argued above,  increasing decision-making authority of managers posi-  tively relates to their ambidexterity by increasing their  freedom and ability to actively pursue a range of  diverse goals (Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004, O’Reilly  and Tushman 2004). However, increasing freedom to  actively pursue a range of diverse goals confronts man-  agers with the challenge to reduce uncertainty and equiv-  ocality about which goals to pursue, about how to pursue  a range of diverse goals, and about the possible out-  comes of the goals being pursued (Floyd and Lane  2000, Smith and Tushman 2005). Participation in cross-  functional interfaces increases managers’ opportunities  and ability to reduce such uncertainty and equivocal-  ity (Daft and Lengel 1986, Miller 1987), for instance,  by promoting thorough and multifaceted assessments of  problems, proposals, and projects; by exchanging infor-  mation, opinions, and judgments with experts; by elic-  iting factual arguments from managers who have to  defend their proposals before peers; and by offering  opportunities for consultation (Daft and Lengel 1986,  Egelhoff 1991, Miller 1987).  Furthermore, as increasing decision-making authority  of managers enables them to pursue a range of diverse  goals (Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004, O’Reilly and  Tushman 2004), authors indicate the importance for  ambidextrous managers to deal with conflict. Pursu-  ing multiple and different goals is associated with  getting confronted with other managers who hold dif-  ferent expectations, who have different perspectives, and  who pursue contrasting goals (Duncan 1976, p. 180;  Floyd and Lane 2000, p. 162; Smith and Tushman  2005, p. 525). Participation in cross-functional interfaces  increases managers’ ability to effectively confront and  resolve conflicts with other managers in several ways—  for example, by stimulating discussion and cooperation  among them (Duncan 1976, p. 181), by stimulating trust  among them (Adler et al. 1999, p. 52), and by motivating  systematic attempts to scrutinize and reconcile divergent  perspectives (Miller 1987, p. 11).  Finally, increasing decision-making authority of man-  agers positively relates to their ambidexterity by increas-  ing their motivation to use and refine their existing  skills and expertise as well as to develop new skills  and expertise (Crossan and Berdrow 2003, McGrath  Mom, van den Bosch, and Volberda: Understanding Variation in Managers’ Ambidexterity  Organization Science 20(4), pp. 812–828, © 2009 INFORMS 817  2001, Floyd and Lane 2000). Participation in cross-  functional interfaces increases managers’ opportunities  to do so by creating a context for managers with dif-  ferent backgrounds to learn from each other (Gibson  and Birkinshaw 2004) and by offering opportunities  to exchange knowledge which enables participants to  acquire both new and diverse knowledge and related  and complementary knowledge (Egelhoff 1991, Jansen  et al. 2005). These arguments suggest the following  hypothesis.  Hypothesis 5. There will be positive interaction  effects between a manager’s decision-making authority  and participation in cross-functional interfaces by the  manager, on this manager’s ambidexterity.  A Manager’s Decision-Making Authority and Connect-  edness. Increasing managers’ decision-making authority  positively relates to these managers’ ambidexterity by  stimulating their willingness to become aware and recog-  nize a large diversity of organizational, market, and tech-  nological opportunities and needs (Pierce and Delbecq  1977, Sheremata 2000, Tushman and O’Reilly 1996).  Increasing the size of managers’ networks helps them to  become more aware and recognize a larger diversity of  such opportunities and needs, by creating more possi-  bilities to search for and identify different ideas, infor-  mation, and inputs from organization members across  hierarchical levels and organizational units (Birkinshaw  and Gibson 2004, Burt 1992, Jaworski and Kohli 1993).  Furthermore, increasing the decision-making author-  ity of managers positively relates to their ambidexter-  ity because it makes them more sensitive to thoroughly  understanding the identified diverse needs and opportu-  nities before acting upon them (Adler et al. 1999, Shere-  mata 2000). However, understanding ideas, information,  and inputs from different units and levels in an orga-  nization may be difficult because they tend to develop  different languages, world views, and thought worlds  (Burns and Stalker 1961, Duncan 1976). Increasing con-  nectedness of a manager to other organization members  enhances this manager’s ability to better understand and  act upon the identified diverse needs and opportunities.  This understanding can be improved through the ability  of densely connected networks to reduce ambiguity sur-  rounding different needs and opportunities by engag-  ing into frequent, reciprocal, and nonroutine information  processing (Daft and Lengel 1986, Egelhoff 1991).  Finally, as indicated by Hypothesis 4, increasingly  dense networks may have dampening effects on man-  agers’ ambidexterity by diffusing strong norms and cre-  ating a dominant logic (Bettis and Wong 2003, Miller  1993, Rowley et al. 2000). This constrains managers  to perform broad searches for knowledge and informa-  tion (Jansen et al. 2005), and it reduces their open-  ness to different opportunities, needs, and perspec-  tives (Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998). Increasing levels  of managers’ decision-making authority may, how-  ever, countervail these negative effects of densely con-  nected networks (Sheremata 2000, p. 401). For instance,  increasing decision-making authority stimulates man-  agers to broaden their search for knowledge and infor-  mation outside their current network of contacts (Jansen  et al. 2005, p. 1001), leading to a richer network of  diverse knowledge (Hage and Aiken 1967, p. 510).  Related to this, others have indicated that increasing  decision-making authority enlarges the diversity of man-  agers’ perspectives (Zmud 1982), increases variety in  their experience (McGrath 2001), and enlarges the range  of diverse solutions they find to problems (Atuahene-  Gima 2003). These arguments suggest the following  hypothesis.  Hypothesis 6. There will be positive interaction  effects between a manager’s decision-making authority  and connectedness of the manager to other organization  members, on this manager’s ambidexterity.  Formalization of a Manager’s Tasks and Participation  in Cross-Functional Interfaces. Increasing formalization  of managers’ tasks negatively relates to their ambidexter-  ity by fostering singleness of purpose and hence decreas-  ing the range of different goals these managers are likely  to pursue (Hage 1965, Pierce and Delbecq 1977). Partic-  ipation in cross-functional interfaces may reduce these  effects of formalization; it forces managers to increase  the range of different goals to take into consideration  (Miller 1987, Whetten 1978) because it demands that  they cooperate with other managers who are likely to  differ in terms of interests, perspectives, beliefs, and val-  ues (Duncan 1976).  Furthermore, increasing formalization of managers’  tasks negatively relates to managers’ ambidexterity  because it increases their sense of isolation resulting  in a reduced motivation of these managers to combine  efforts with others (Hage and Aiken 1969, Organ and  Greene 1981). The literature indicates, however, that par-  ticipation in cross-functional interfaces pulls managers  out of their isolation and increases their motivation to  combine efforts with others. For instance, it positively  influences motivation to work together to solve problems  (Sheremata 2000), to implement innovations (Duncan  1976), and to generate mutual commitment to make and  realize decisions (Bahrami and Evans 1987).  Finally, increasing formalization of managers’ tasks  negatively relates to these managers’ ambidexterity  by stimulating them to increasingly develop expertise  within the specialized area of their formalized tasks  (Hage 1965, Zander and Kogut 1995) and by making  it more difficult for them to broaden their knowledge  and skill base (Daft and Lengel 1986). Effective partic-  ipation in cross-functional interfaces, however, requires  managers to understand, enter into discussion, and inter-  act with managers from different fields of expertise  Mom, van den Bosch, and Volberda: Understanding Variation in Managers’ Ambidexterity  818 Organization Science 20(4), pp. 812–828, © 2009 INFORMS  and with different knowledge (Egelhoff 1991, Ghoshal  and Bartlett 1988). Consequently, participation in cross-  functional interfaces stimulates managers to learn from  each other (Nonaka and Konno 1998); to broaden their  expertise beyond the narrow confines of their own job  (Bahrami and Evans 1987, Miller 1987); and to broaden  their knowledge base by acquiring, assimilating, and  using new knowledge (Jansen et al. 2005). These argu-  ments suggest the following hypothesis.  Hypothesis 7. There will be positive interaction  effects between formalization of a manager’s tasks and  participation in cross-functional interfaces by the man-  ager, on this manager’s ambidexterity.  Formalization of a Manager’s Tasks and Connected-  ness. Increasing formalization of managers’ tasks nega-  tively relates to these managers’ ambidexterity because  formalization increases the possibility that a manager  becomes less receptive to decision-making stimuli that  are not monitored by formal systems (Cyert and March  1963). An increasing size of managers’ networks across  organization units and hierarchical levels may more than  compensate for these effects of formalization by extend-  ing the number of information channels by which a  manager can access valuable ideas, insights, and infor-  mation (Burt 1992, Ghoshal et al. 1994). Furthermore,  an increasingly dense network of personal contacts  positively influences the speed by which these ideas,  insights, and information become available to the net-  work members (Burt 1992, Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998).  Increasing formalization of managers’ tasks negatively  relates to their ambidexterity by reducing the extent  to which these managers establish and maintain inter-  personal relations (Hage and Aiken 1969, Pugh et al.  1963). Moreover, it may increase a sense of isola-  tion, resulting in a reduced motivation to cooperate and  combine efforts with others (Organ and Greene 1981,  Pierce and Delbecq 1977). Increasing levels of con-  nectedness with other organization members may com-  pensate these effects because doing so is directly asso-  ciated with establishing and maintaining an increasing  number of interpersonal relations (Jaworksi and Kohli  1993). Furthermore, increasing levels of densely con-  nected relations decreases the network members’ sense  of isolation and increases their motivation to cooper-  ate and combine efforts by developing trust and mutual  identification (Adler and Kwon 2002, Coleman 1990),  by providing a common frame of reference (Coleman  1990, Uzzi 1997), and by reducing the probability of  opportunistic behavior (Rindfleisch and Moorman 2001).  Finally, increasingly dense networks may have damp-  ening effects on a manager’s ambidexterity because  maintaining a large and densely connected network  requires time and effort which is associated with  increased costs and reduced efficiency in performing  tasks and with reduced speed in completing both explo-  rative and exploitative projects (Hansen et al. 2001, Uzzi  1997). Increasing levels of formalization of managers’  tasks may undo these negative effects of increasing lev-  els of connectedness as increasing formalization of tasks  is associated with higher production, greater efficiency  in performance, and increased speed of decision making  (Baum and Wally 2003, Hage 1965, Hall et al. 1967).  These arguments suggest the following hypothesis.  Hypothesis 8. There will be positive interaction  effects between formalization of a manager’s tasks and  connectedness of the manager to other organization  members, on this manager’s ambidexterity.  Methods  Sample and Data Collection  We followed existing quantitative studies on managers’  activities that typically draw upon a sample composed  of a large number of managers of a small number of  firms (e.g., Ghoshal et al. 1994, Ireland et al. 1987,  Walsh 1988). To test the hypotheses, we obtained data  through a survey of managers in five large firms. Each  of these firms ranks among the top 25 on the For-  tune Global 500 (2007) in terms of total revenues in  their industry. The choice of these five companies was  a result of several considerations. To minimize com-  promising the external validity of the findings due to  industry specific effects, we selected firms that oper-  ate in different manufacturing and service industries  (Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004): electronics (Firm A),  financial services (Firm B), accountancy and profes-  sional services (Firm C), telecommunications (Firm D),  and chemicals (Firm E). Furthermore, investigating man-  agers’ ambidexterity compelled us to examine managers  whose firms are confronted with pressures to explore and  with pressures to exploit. Several studies (e.g., Banker  et al. 2005, Flier et al. 2001, Gibson and Birkinshaw  2004, Henisz and Macher 2004) indicate that firms in the  selected industries are forced to explore due to changes  regarding technologies, customer demands, competition,  and regulation. These studies also indicate that these  firms are forced at the same time to exploit due to  short-term competitive pressures in terms of an increased  focus on efficiency and cutting costs and the increas-  ing importance of economies of scale. Moreover, focus-  ing on large firms increased the possibility to observe  variance not only in this study’s dependent variable but  also in the explanatory variables (Ghoshal et al. 1994,  McDonough and Leifer 1983).  In each of the firms, the survey was sent, in con-  sultation with corporate top management, to a number  of selected managers. These are business unit level and  operational level managers with various functional back-  grounds such as research and development, marketing  Mom, van den Bosch, and Volberda: Understanding Variation in Managers’ Ambidexterity  Organization Science 20(4), pp. 812–828, © 2009 INFORMS 819  and sales, and operations. Furthermore, the managers  represent a wide variety in terms of demographic char-  acteristics such as age, job tenure, functional tenure, and  education. The survey was sent to 1,797 managers. For  each firm, chi-square tests (p < 0 05;  = 0 05) indicate  that the distribution of the managers over the hierarchi-  cal levels and functional areas corresponds to the dis-  tribution of all managers. This indicates that bias due  to the sampling procedure may not be a problem. To  ensure confidentiality, we agreed not to reveal the names  of the respondents, who returned the completed surveys  to us without interference from corporate management.  We received 755 completed surveys, corresponding to a  response rate of 42%. List-wise deletion of cases with  missing values reduced the final sample size to 716;  1  i.e.  110, 161, 186, 148, and 111 managers of Firm A, B,  C, D, and E, respectively. This sample included 215  business unit level managers and 501 operational level  managers. The average age of the managers is 39 years,  the average job tenure within the firm is 10 years, and  the average span of control is 41 employees.  We examined differences between respondents and  nonrespondents to test for nonresponse bias. Chi-square  tests (p < 0 05;   = 0 05) indicate that the distribution  of the respondents over the firms, hierarchical levels, and  functions corresponds to the population’s distribution.  We also compared early and late respondents (t-test; p <  0 05) in terms of demographic characteristics and model  variables because late respondents can be expected to  be similar to nonrespondents (Armstrong and Overton  1977). No significant differences appeared, indicating  that nonresponse bias may not be a problem.  Measures and Validation  Dependent Variable. We constructed a scale to mea-  sure a manager’s ambidexterity beccuase an appropriate  scale at the individual level was not available in the lit-  erature. Scales of firm or business unit ambidexterity  are constructed by combining measures of exploration  and exploitation (Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004, He and  Wong 2004, Lubatkin et al. 2006). Following this prac-  tice, we started by developing measures for exploration  and exploitation at the manager level of analysis.  To develop these measures, we took the following  steps. First, following the definition of ambidexterity at  the manager level, we developed seven manager’s explo-  ration activity items and seven manager’s exploitation  activity items. To enhance content validity, we devel-  oped these items based on the features by which March  (1991, p. 71) characterized the constructs of exploration  and exploitation and based on studies that illustrate man-  agers’ ambidextrous behavior in terms of exploration  and exploitation related activities (e.g., Adler et al. 1999,  Floyd and Lane 2000, Ghemawat and Ricart I Costa  1993, Tushman and O’Reilly 1996). Second, to fur-  ther increase content validity and to enhance the word-  ing of the items, six in-depth interviews were held by  the authors with managers of various hierarchical and  functional positions of firms A, B, and C. During the  interviews, managers were asked to complete the ques-  tionnaire, to indicate the relevance of the items, and  to indicate any ambiguity regarding the phrasing of the  items. Based on these interviews, the content and phras-  ing of the items were further enhanced by the authors,  a process which resulted in a test version of the survey.  Third, to allow enhancement of the reliability, unidimen-  sionality, and convergent and discriminant validity of  the exploration and exploitation scales, we quantitatively  tested the scales based on data we obtained through a  test version of the survey of 33 managers of various hier-  archical and functional positions of firms A, B, and C.  Following reliability and validity analyses, five ambigu-  ous items of the exploration and exploitation scales were  identified. Fourth, during 12 in-depth interviews with  managers of various hierarchical and functional posi-  tions of firms A, B, and C, managers were asked to  suggest improvements to the ambiguous items as iden-  tified at the previous step. Based on these interviews,  we further enhanced the phrasing of these items, a pro-  cess that resulted in the final version of the scales. The  exploration scale determines the extent to which a man-  ager engaged in exploration activities last year, whereas  the exploitation scale determines the extent to which the  manager engaged in exploitation activities last year.  To check for convergent and discriminant validity, we  performed exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.  Exploratory factor analysis (see Table 1) with Varimax  rotation with all 14 items, based on the survey data,  revealed that two summated scales could be constructed;  one exploration scale with the seven exploration items  and one exploitation scale with the seven exploitation  items. Eigenvalues for each factor were greater than 3.6,  all items loaded on their appropriate factors at greater  than 0.69, and no item cross-loading was greater than  0.18. Both scales are reliable: exploration   = 0 90;  exploitation  = 0 87. We conducted confirmatory factor  analysis (CFA) of the 14 items to check for discriminant  validity of the constructs. Results indicate that the two-  factor model fits the data well (NFI= 0 93, CFI= 0 95,  RMSEA < 0 07). Moreover, a comparison of a one-  factor model with a two-factor model shows a significant  improvement in fit (    2  significant at p < 0 001), pro-  viding evidence of discriminant validity (Bagozzi and  Phillips 1982).  Prior studies combine exploration and exploita-  tion measures to assess ambidexterity (Gibson and  Birkinshaw 2004, He and Wong 2004, Lubatkin et al.  2006). Gibson and Birkinshaw’s (2004, p. 211) concep-  tualization of ambidexterity explicitly takes the ambidex-  trous behavior of individuals into consideration.

Independent Variables. This study’s measures of the  formal structural and personal coordination mechanisms  are based on existing scales. To measure the extent  of a manager’s decision-making authority, we used a  four item scale of Dewar et al. (1980), which assesses  the extent to which a manager has decision-making  authority in the performance of his or her tasks and in  his or her ability to set goals ( = 0 91). To assess the  extent of formalization of a manager’s tasks, this study  used a four item scale from Desphande and Zaltman  (1982), which measures the extent to which a manager’s  tasks are defined by rules, procedures, or regulations  ( = 0 89). To measure participation in cross-functional  interfaces by a manager, this study used a scale on  the basis of Nadler and Tushman (1987) and Gupta  and Govindarajan (2000), which assesses the extent to  which a manager participates in cross-unit and cross-  hierarchical integrative mechanisms, asking each man-  ager to what extent he or she (1) coordinates work across  internal organizational boundaries, (2) works in tempo-  rary task forces, and (3) works in permanent teams.  Following Gupta and Govindarajan (2000, p. 495) and  Jansen et al. (2005, p. 1005), we constructed the final  measure as a weighted average of the three items, where  the first item is given a weight of 1, the second item a  weight of 2, and the last item a weight of 3. To mea-  sure connectedness of a manager to other organization  members, a four-item scale based on Jaworski and Kohli  (1993) and Jansen et al. (2006) was used, which assessed  the extent to which a manager is networked or connected  to other organization members across hierarchical levels  and organizational units in terms of direct personal con-  tacts ( = 0 87). Prior to the creation of the interaction  terms in the regression models, we mean centered the  independent variables to reduce multicollinearity (Aiken  and West 1991). Appendix 1 shows the items of the  independent variables.  Control Variables. Managers’ experience may influ-  ence their ambidexterity: increased levels of experience  are associated with an increased ability to interpret and  deal with a larger diversity of ambiguous cues (Daft  and Lengel 1986, p. 555). The broadness of experience  also matters because an ambidextrous manager’s skill  base is “more generalist” rather than “more specialist”  (Birkinshaw and Gibson 2004, p. 49). To control for  experience, we included a manager’s age and tenure  within the firm, which are expected to positively relate to  managers’ ambidexterity (Tushman and O’Reilly 1996,  p. 27). We also included a manager’s tenure in his or her  current function, which is associated with increasing lev-  els of specialization and hence is expected to negatively  relate to the manager’s ambidexterity (cf. Birkinshaw  and Gibson 2004, p. 49). Increasing levels of education  are associated with increasing cognitive abilities to pro-  cess information and learning (Papadakis et al. 1998),  which may positively relate to managers’ ambidexterity  (Adler et al. 1999, p. 51). We controlled for educational  effects by including two dummy variables; one reflecting  managers with master’s degrees or higher, and another  reflecting managers with bachelor’s degrees, making  managers with degrees below the bachelor’s level the  reference group. Exploration and exploitation compete  for scarce resources (March 1991). Managers of larger  Mom, van den Bosch, and Volberda: Understanding Variation in Managers’ Ambidexterity  Organization Science 20(4), pp. 812–828, © 2009 INFORMS 821  units may have more resources at their disposal, which  can be allocated to both exploration and exploitation  activities (Lewin et al. 1999). To control for size effects,  we included the natural log of the number of subordi-  nates of a manager. The hierarchical level of a manager  may impact upon the manager’s level of ambidexter-  ity. Higher level managers are typically expected to be  more ambidextrous than lower level managers (Floyd  and Lane 2000, p. 158; O’Reilly and Tushman 2004).  We distinguished business unit level managers and oper-  ational level managers and controlled for hierarchical  level effects by including one dummy variable (busi-  ness unit level= 1, operational level= 0). Business unit  level managers had at least two levels of supervisors  under their responsibility and were no more than two  reporting levels below top executives. Operational level  managers report to business unit managers or to levels  below these managers (cf. Ireland et al. 1987, p. 474).  Levels of managers’ exploration and exploitation activ-  ities may differ across functional areas (Duncan 1976).  We created three dummy variables, one for research  and development (R&D), one for marketing and sales  (M&S), and one for operations, to control for functional  effects. Dummies for R&D and M&S are included in the  regression models. Environmental dynamism may influ-  ence the extent to which a manager engages in explo-  ration or exploitation activities or both (Jansen et al.  2006, Lewin et al. 1999). We therefore included a four-  item scale ( = 0 89) that captured the degree of envi-  ronmental dynamism that a manager faces (Dill 1958,  Jansen et al. 2006). Sample items are “My (internal or  external) clients regularly ask for complete new products  and services” and “In my business, changes are intense.”  Finally, to control for organizational contextual factors  (Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004), we created dummy vari-  ables reflecting the five firms. No dummy has been  included for Firm E, making this firm the reference  firm.  Validation. We conducted exploratory and confirma-  tory factor analyses including all items of this study’s  constructs, i.e., those measuring exploration, exploita-  tion, and the four coordination mechanisms, to assess  construct validity of the measures. Results of the  exploratory factor analysis (extraction method: princi-  pal component analysis; rotation method: Varimax with  Kaiser normalization) indicate that the measures were  appropriately constructed; eigenvalues for each factor  were greater than one, all items loaded on their appro-  priate factors at greater than 0.67, and no item cross-  loading was greater than 30, supporting the six-factor  solution. We conducted an integrated confirmatory fac-  tor analysis on all items. We allowed each item to load  only on the factor for which it was a proposed indicator.  Results indicate that the six-factor model fits the data  well (NFI= 0 92, CFI= 0 95, RMSEA< 0 05). More-  over, a comparison of a one-factor model with a two-  factor model for every pair among the factors shows a  significant improvement in fit for each of the 15 pairs  (    2  significant at p < 0 001), providing evidence of  discriminant validity (Bagozzi and Phillips 1982).  Analysis and Results  Table 2 shows descriptive statistics and correlations for  all variables. Table 3 presents the results of the hierar-  chical regression analyses for managers’ ambidexterity.  To examine multicollinearity, we calculated the vari-  ance inflation factor (VIF) for each of the regression  equations. VIFs are between 3.48 and 1.08, which is  below the rule-of-thumb cutoff of 10 (Neter et al. 1990);  issues of multicollinearity seem not to be a problem.  Among the control variables, the full model—Model 3  of Table 3—shows that age and tenure in the current  function negatively relate to managers’ ambidexterity,  that tenure in the firm and environmental dynamism pos-  itively relate to managers’ ambidexterity, that business  unit level managers are more ambidextrous than oper-  ational level managers, and that managers of Firm A  are more ambidextrous than those of the reference Firm,  whereas managers of Firm D are less ambidextrous.  Tests of Main Effects. Model 2 of Table 3 shows the  main effects referring to Hypotheses 1–4. This model  shows that a manager’s decision-making authority posi-  tively relates to this manager’s ambidexterity ( = 0 14,  p < 0 001), supporting Hypothesis 1. The coefficient for  formalization of a manager’s tasks is positive and not  significant (  = 0 03, ns); hence, Hypothesis 2 is not  supported. Participation of a manager in cross-functional  interfaces positively relates to the manager’s ambidex-  terity (  = 0 19, p < 0 001), supporting Hypothesis 3.  Regarding connectedness of a manager to other organi-  zation members, we predicted an inverted U-shaped rela-  tionship with this manager’s ambidexterity. As Model 2  shows, the coefficient for connectedness is positive and  significant (  = 0 17, p < 0 001). However, the coeffi-  cient for the squared term is positive and not significant  (  = 0 03, ns). Accordingly, the relationship between a  manager’s connectedness to other organization members  and the manager’s ambidexterity is positive rather than  curvilinear, thereby not supporting Hypothesis 4. Regard-  ing the size of the three significant main effects, two  significant differences appear. That is, the coefficient of  participation in cross-functional interfaces is larger than  the coefficient of decision-making authority (t-value of  difference = 2 47; p < 0 05; 2-tailed testing), and the  coefficient of connectedness is larger than the coefficient  of decision-making authority (t-value of difference =  1 94; p < 0 05; two-tailed testing). Hence, the direct  effect of the two personal coordination mechanisms on  Mom, van den Bosch, and Volberda: Understanding Variation in Managers’ Ambidexterity  822 Organization Science 20(4), pp. 812–828, © 2009 INFORMS  T  a  b  l  e  2  M  e  a  n  s  ,  S  t  a  n  d  a  r  d  D  e  v  i  a  t  i  o  n  s  ,  M  i  n  i  m  u  m  a  n  d  M  a  x  i  m  u  m  V  a  l  u  e  s  ,  a  n  d  C  o  r  r  e  l  a  t  i  o  n  s  M  e  a  n  S  t  .  d  e  v  .

Tests of Interaction Effects. Model 3 of Table 3 shows  the interaction effects referring to Hypotheses 5–8. As  the inclusion of connectedness squared did not signif-  icantly improve model fit (Model 2 of Table 3), we  dropped the squared term in Model 3 (e.g. Katila and  Ahuja 2002). The interaction term between a manager’s  decision-making authority and participation in cross-  functional interfaces by the manager is positive and  significant (  = 0 12, p < 0 001), supporting Hypoth-  esis 5. Hypothesis 6 is also supported because the  interaction term between a manager’s decision-making  authority and the manager’s connectedness to other orga-  nization members is positive and significant (  = 0 09,  p < 0 01). The interaction term between formalization  of a manager’s tasks and the manager’s participation  in cross-functional interfaces is positive and significant  ( = 0 09, p < 0 01), supporting Hypothesis 7. Hypoth-  esis 8 is also supported because the interaction term  between formalization of a manager’s tasks and the man-  ager’s connectedness to other organization members is  positive and significant (  = 0 11, p < 0 01). These  results indicate that positive interaction effects exist  between the formal structural and the personal coordina-  tion mechanisms on managers’ ambidexterity. There are  no significant differences between the four interaction  effects in terms of their size.  Post Hoc Analyses. The sample’s managers can be  grouped into different functional areas, firms, and hier-  archical levels. We conducted several post hoc analyses,  which indicate that (1) possible functional area, firm,  or hierarchical level specific characteristics are not driv-  ing the results of the paper as presented in Table 3 and  (2) the results as reported in Table 3 do not signifi-  cantly differ across functional area, firm, or hierarchi-  cal level subgroups of managers. With respect to the  second result, there are two exceptions: the effect of  decision-making authority on ambidexterity is larger for  operational level managers than for business unit level  managers, whereas the effect of participation in cross-  functional interfaces on ambidexterity is larger for busi-  ness unit level managers than for operational level man-  agers. For the detailed procedures and results of the post  hoc analyses, refer to Appendix 2.  Discussion and Conclusion  The current body of research on ambidexterity focuses  on firm and business unit level ambidexterity.

This paper contributed to further understanding  on both issues in three ways: (1) by proposing and  clarifying three related characteristics of ambidextrous  managers by integrating insights from prior research;  (2) by developing a model and associated hypotheses on  both the direct and interaction effects of formal struc-  tural and personal coordination mechanisms on man-  agers’ ambidexterity; and (3) by testing the hypotheses  based on a sample of 716 business unit level and oper-  ational level managers. The paper’s contributions raise  several important issues for both theory and practice.  First, whether ambidextrous managers may exist, i.e.,  whether exploration and exploitation exclude each other  at the individual level of analysis, is still debated  (cf. Gupta et al. 2006). Although it may be argued to  be “very difficult for an individual to     excel at both  exploration and exploitation” (Gupta et al. 2006, p. 696),  this paper demonstrates that these difficulties are not  insurmountable. By integrating insights from previous  studies, we theorized and illustrated three related char-  acteristics of ambidextrous managers. Empirically, the  paper also demonstrates that managers can indeed be  ambidextrous; i.e., they may engage in high levels  of both exploration and exploitation related activities.  This is, for instance, illustrated by the results of the  exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses which  show that exploration and exploitation are two distinct  latent factors of a second order construct; managers’  ambidexterity. This indicates that managers’ exploration  and exploitation activities are not mutually exclusive  ends of a continuum. Furthermore, as the data indicates,  managers differ in the extent to which they are ambidex-  trous. Whereas some are not ambidextrous because they  focus on either exploration or exploitation, others are  ambidextrous because they engage in high levels of both  exploration and exploitation related activities.  Second, the paper furthers theoretical and empirically  validated understanding about variation in managers’ am-  bidexterity by developing and testing hypotheses on the  direct effects of formal structural and personal coordina-  tion mechanisms on managers’ ambidexterity. Existing  Mom, van den Bosch, and Volberda: Understanding Variation in Managers’ Ambidexterity  824 Organization Science 20(4), pp. 812–828, © 2009 INFORMS  studies on firm or business unit level ambidexterity  mostly put forward structural mechanisms for advancing  ambidexterity (e.g., Benner and Tushman 2003, Duncan  1976), whereas others have illustrated the importance of  more personal relationships (e.g., Birkinshaw and Gib-  son 2004, Subramaniam and Youndt 2005). Regarding  individual level ambidexterity, the hypotheses of this  paper indicate that both kinds of mechanisms matter for  managers’ ambidexterity. However, empirical findings  on the direct effects indicate that both types might not be  equally effective. Instead, the findings emphasize the rel-  atively large effect of the personal types of coordination  mechanisms as compared to the formal structural types  of mechanisms on managers’ ambidexterity. This is in  line with recent studies on learning and coordination  that indicate the importance of more informal and per-  sonal types of coordination for shaping knowledge and  learning related processes and activities of organization  members (e.g., Argote et al. 2003, Faraj and Xiao 2006).  Interestingly, two hypotheses on the direct effects  were not confirmed. With regard to formalization of  a manager’s tasks (Hypothesis 2), our findings did  not provide support for the predicted negative rela-  tion with a manager’s ambidexterity. This may concur  with recent insights that suggest that formalized routines  may increase information flows to managers, which may  improve their overall quality and speed of decision mak-  ing (Baum and Wally 2003). Formalized rules and pro-  cedures may also include processes for effecting change  (Adler and Borys 1996), which corresponds to the Adler  et al. (1999, p. 45) concept of “metaroutines” that may  enable organizations to become more ambidextrous by  transforming nonroutine tasks into more-routine ones. As  the effect of formalization on individuals’ behavior may  be contingent on its design, future studies could differ-  entiate between types of formalization, such as enabling  and coercive types (Adler and Borys 1996). Regarding  connectedness of a manager to other organization mem-  bers across hierarchical levels and organization units,  Hypothesis 4 predicted an inverted U-shaped relationship  with this manager’s ambidexterity. Instead, we found the  relationship to be positive rather than curvilinear. Appar-  ently, the expected dampening effects of increasing lev-  els of connectedness on managers’ ambidexterity are not  present in the data sample. A possible explanation may be  the study’s research context of large firms in which mem-  bers of organization units may differ considerably from  each other in terms of values, norms, and their knowl-  edge base, due to different products or services they pro-  vide, different technologies or processes they apply, and  different markets they serve. Hence, future research may  examine the impact of other characteristics of managers’  personal networks such as the level of heterogeneity,  which may make the diffusion of strong norms and the  creation of a dominant logic more difficult, even if the  network is densely connected (Reagans and Zuckerman  2001, Rodan and Galunic 2004, Smith et al. 2005).  Third, the paper develops theoretical and empirically  validated understanding about variation in managers’  ambidexterity by developing and testing hypotheses on  the interaction effects of formal structural and per-  sonal coordination mechanisms on managers’ ambidex-  terity. Not only empirically validated insight but also  theoretical insight on the combined effect of different  organizational elements on ambidexterity is scarce in the  literature on ambidexterity (see, e.g., Jansen et al. 2006,  Rivkin and Siggelkow 2003). This gap is highlighted by  Raisch and Birkinshaw (2008, p. 399), who argue that  “the interrelations between different antecedents” have  thus far “been neglected or not been fully conceptualized  in the literature on ambidexterity.” Consequently, they  argue to “develop and test propositions on how different  antecedents interact and complement one another in a  firm’s pursuit of organizational ambidexterity” (Raisch  and Birkinshaw 2008, p. 399). This paper’s interaction  hypotheses and the associated results indicate positive  interaction effects between the formal structural and the  personal coordination mechanisms. Hence, an interesting  finding, also for managerial practice, is that the com-  bined effect of the two types of coordination mecha-  nisms on managers’ ambidexterity is larger than simply  the sum of their independent effects. In other words,  complementing formal structural coordination mecha-  nisms with personal mechanisms increases the mecha-  nisms’ contribution to managers’ ambidexterity.  The paper’s hypotheses and empirical findings on the  interaction effects seem also to provide new avenues  for research on new organizational forms. A well-  established stream in contingency theory has examined  mechanistic versus organic forms, stressing internal  fit and consistency between coordination mechanisms  (Burns and Stalker 1961, Duncan 1976, Lawrence and  Lorsch 1967). However, our results seem to support  hybrid or simultaneous forms that combine the formal  structure with strong cross-functional integration and  internal networks. In these illogical designs, accord-  ing to contingency theory, there is a coexistence of  formal organization structure and horizontal ties. Man-  agers responsible for ambidextrous forms can choose  to compensate their formal mechanistic structure by  encouraging decision-making authority, cross-functional  interfaces, and connectedness among their managers. On  the other hand, they can also seize upon the formaliza-  tion devices to solidify and extend a more homogeneous  orientation of their managers. This simultaneous expres-  sion of formal hierarchical structure and horizontal rela-  tionships fosters their managers’ ambidexterity.  Fourth, results of the post hoc analysis indicate that  the effect of decision-making authority on ambidexterity  is larger for operational level manager than for business  unit level managers, whereas the effect of participation  in cross-functional interfaces on ambidexterity is larger  for business unit level managers than for operational  level managers. These findings highlight the particular  Mom, van den Bosch, and Volberda: Understanding Variation in Managers’ Ambidexterity  Organization Science 20(4), pp. 812–828, © 2009 INFORMS 825  importance, also for managerial practice, of personal co-  ordination mechanisms for business unit level managers’  ambidexterity. This is in line with studies on strategy  process research, which indicate that business unit level  managers focus on establishing interactions and building  relationships between different hierarchical levels, orga-  nization units, and functions, for conducting exploration  and exploitation related activities (Burgelman 1983,  Floyd and Lane 2000). One of the main characteristics  of cross-functional interfaces is that they allow for esta-  blishing interactions and building relationships across  internal vertical, horizontal, and lateral organizational  boundaries (Martinez and Jarillo 1989, Galbraith 1973).  Therefore, cross-functional interfaces may have greater  capacity for enabling business unit level managers’  ambidexterity as compared to operational level man-  agers’ ambidexterity. An interesting finding, also for  managerial practice, is the importance of formal struc-  tural coordination mechanisms for operational level man-  agers’ ambidexterity. This is in line with, among others,  Floyd and Lane (2000), who stress the importance of for-  mal structural mechanisms for shaping lower level man-  agers’ exploration and exploitation activities.  Finally, investigating ambidexterity at the manager  level of analysis raises the question about the locus of  action, i.e., about who exerts control on the coordi-  nation mechanisms to enable managers’ ambidexterity.  Several studies on ambidexterity at the firm and business  unit level of analysis indicate the importance of corpo-  rate or most senior management for controlling formal  structural elements (e.g., Duncan 1976, Tushman and  O’Reilly 1996) and for developing the organization con-  text (Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004, p. 223). Investigating  ambidexterity at the manager level of analysis highlights  an important insight for managerial practice: the impor-  tance of both these managers’ supervisors, which may  reside at lower levels in the organization than corpo-  rate management, and the managers themselves for shap-  ing these managers’ surroundings, and, consequently,  their ambidexterity. We argue that regarding a manager’s  decision-making authority and formalization of tasks,  and to a large extent participation in cross-functional  interfaces, the locus of action is most likely with that  manager’s direct supervisor and that manager’s supervi-  sors at higher levels. With regard to the connectedness  of a manager to other organization members, the locus  of action may be more with the manager him- or herself,  as connectedness comprises a more “voluntary and per-  sonal mode of coordination” (Tsai 2002, p. 181). These  arguments are in line with, for instance, McDonough and  Leifer (1983), who argue and empirically demonstrate  that a “supervisor may employ different structures at  the same time for use by different individuals or groups  within the work unit” (1983, p. 728).  Limitations and Future Research  Our study has limitations, suggesting several issues  for future research. The study involves cross-sectional,  single informant data and uses perceptual scales  highlighting issues of common method bias and causal  reciprocity. Regarding the issue of common method  bias, we performed Harman’s one-factor test on items  included in the regression models. If common method  bias were a serious problem in the study, we would  expect a single factor to emerge to account for most of  the covariance in the dependent and independent vari-  ables (Podsakoff and Organ 1986). We did not find such  a single factor. The issue of common method bias could  be addressed in future studies by measuring ambidex-  terity at the managerial level of analysis using objective  measures. Furthermore, as indicated, our methods are  suited to establish relationships between the constructs,  but not causality. To create more insight in the direc-  tion of causality, future studies may adopt a longitudinal  approach to increase insight into how changes in coordi-  nation mechanisms and changes in managers’ ambidex-  terity causally relate to each other. Related to the  question of causality is the discussion above on the locus  of action. Future research could create more insight into  this issue by adopting a multiple level approach examin-  ing interactions between actions and decisions of man-  agers of different hierarchical levels. Furthermore, we  limited the focus of this paper by investigating how dif-  ferent coordination mechanisms relate to the ambidex-  trous behavior of managers. Although this leads to valu-  able and actionable knowledge, future research could  investigate other potential factors that relate to man-  agers’ ambidexterity. For instance, the results on the con-  trol variables indicate that demographic factors such as  age, tenure in the firm, and tenure in the current function  significantly relate to managers’ ambidexterity. Future  research could delve into the role of moderators, such  as the hierarchical level of managers. Another limitation  of this paper in this respect is that we did not explic-  itly address external drivers of managers’ ambidexter-  ity, except that we controlled for the impact of environ-  mental dynamism. Hence, future research could explore  and compare, for instance, the impact on managers’  ambidexterity of formal inter-organizational personal  relationships, like task forces with suppliers or clients,  and more informal direct contacts with these external  constituencies. Finally, in the introduction section of the  paper, we illustrated that previous research indicates the  relevance of investigating managers’ ambidexterity for  increasing understanding about how to build ambidex-  terity in a firm. In a related vein, it is also interesting to  explicitly examine the relationships between managers’  ambidextrous behavior and the firm’s or business unit’s  level of ambidexterity and performance.  Despite these limitations, in response to the call for  research into variations in managers’ ambidexterity, this  paper contributed to the literature by investigating, both  Mom, van den Bosch, and Volberda: Understanding Variation in Managers’ Ambidexterity  826 Organization Science 20(4), pp. 812–828, © 2009 INFORMS  conceptually and empirically, ambidexterity at the man-  ager level of analysis and how different types of coor-  dination mechanisms relate to variations in managers’  ambidexterity. By doing so, we contributed to both the-  oretical and empirical foundations of the concept of  ambidextrous organizations and their managers.

Measures and Items of Explanatory  Variables at the Manager Level  2  A manager’s decision-making authority (based on Dewar  et al. 1980)  I can undertake little action until my supervisor approves a  decision.  If I want to make my own decisions, I will be quickly  discouraged.  I have to ask my supervisor before I do almost everything.  Any decision I make has to have my supervisor’s approval.  Formalization of a manager’s tasks (based on Desphande  and Zaltman 1982)  Whatever situation arises, I have procedures to follow in  dealing with it.  I have to follow strict operational procedures at all times.  Rules occupy a central place in my work related activities.  There is a written job description for going about my tasks.  Participation in cross-functional interfaces by a manager  (based on Gupta and Govindarajan 2000, Nadler and Tushman  1987)  I coordinate work across internal organizational boundaries.  I work in temporary task forces.  I work in permanent teams.  Connectedness of a manager to other organization mem-  bers (based on Jaworski and Kohli 1993)  There are many opportunities for me to talk to individuals  from all kinds of different organizational units.  I very frequently have contact with people, regardless of  rank or position.  The personal network I have throughout the organization  can be called “extensive.”  I feel very comfortable calling others, regardless of rank,  position, or organizational unit, when the need arises.  Appendix 2. Post Hoc Analyses  The sample’s managers can be grouped into different func-  tional areas, firms, and hierarchical levels. We investigated  whether possible functional area, firm, and hierarchical level  specific characteristics are driving the results and whether the  results differ across functional area, firm, and hierarchical level  subgroups of managers. To do so, we first examined whether  significant interaction effects exist between the four indepen-  dent variables and functional area, firm, and hierarchical level,  on managers’ ambidexterity. Second, we examined whether  the main effects that were found to be significant in Model 3  of Table 3 remain significant after including the functional  area, firm, and hierarchical level interaction terms. Finally, we  split the total sample into functional area, firm, and hierarchi-  cal level subgroups of managers to examine the main effects  within each separate subgroup (Aiken and West 1991, Hardy  1993, Jaccard and Turrisi 2003).  After having created interaction terms of the dummy vari-  ables pertaining to the functional areas with the four inde-  pendent variables, we included these interaction terms in  regression Model 3 of Table 3. Results are as follows: First, the  interaction terms are not significant, and including the inter-  action terms does not result in a significant improvement of  model fit. Second, the three main effects that are found to be  significant in Model 3 of Table 3 remain significant, whereas  the main effect of formalization of tasks remains insignifi-  cant. Finally, the four main effects in each of the three func-  tional area subsamples are the same as those in the total sam-  ple; i.e., within each of the three functional area subsamples  there is no significant relation between formalization of tasks  and managers’ ambidexterity, but there are positive and sig-  nificant relations between decision-making authority, partic-  ipation in cross-functional interfaces, and connectedness, on  managers’ ambidexterity. These results indicate that functional  area does not moderate the relation between the independent  variables and managers’ ambidexterity, that possible functional  area specific characteristics are not driving the results as pre-  sented in Model 3 of Table 3, and that the results as presented  in Model 3 of Table 3 do not differ across functional area  subgroups.  After having created interaction terms of the dummy vari-  ables pertaining to the firms with the four independent  variables, we included these interaction terms in regression  Model 3 of Table 3. Results are the same as those for func-  tional area: First, the interaction terms are not significant, and  there is no significant improvement of model fit. Second, the  three main effects that are found to be significant in Model 3 of  Table 3 remain significant, whereas the main effect of formal-  ization of tasks remains insignificant. Finally, the four main  effects in each of the five firm subsamples are the same as  those in the total sample. These results indicate that firm spe-  cific characteristics do not moderate the relation between the  independent variables and managers’ ambidexterity, that pos-  sible firm specific characteristics are not driving the results  as presented in Model 3 of Table 3, and that the results as  presented in Model 3 of Table 3 do not differ across firms.  After having created interaction terms of the dummy vari-  ables pertaining to the hierarchical levels with the four inde-  pendent variables, we included these interaction terms in  regression Model 3 of Table 3. Including these interaction  terms, first, results in a significant improvement of model fit.  More specifically, results indicate that the effect of decision-  making authority on ambidexterity is larger for operational  level manager than for business unit level managers, whereas  the effect of participation in cross-functional interfaces on  ambidexterity is larger for business unit level managers than  for operational level managers. Second, notwithstanding these  significant interaction effects, the three main effects that are  found to be significant in Model 3 of Table 3 remain signifi-  cant after inclusion of the interaction terms, whereas the main  effect of formalization of tasks remains insignificant. Finally,  the four main effects in both hierarchical level subsamples  are the same as those in the total sample, except the effect  of managers’ decision-making authority, which is positive but  not significant in the business unit level subsample. These  Mom, van den Bosch, and Volberda: Understanding Variation in Managers’ Ambidexterity  Organization Science 20(4), pp. 812–828, © 2009 INFORMS 827  results indicate that hierarchical level does moderate the rela-  tion between two of the independent variables and managers’  ambidexterity but that possible hierarchical level specific char-  acteristics are not driving the results as presented in Model 3  of Table 3.  Endnotes  1  We identified two cases with residual values larger than three  standard deviations (Aiken and West 1991). Excluding these  two outliers did not change any of the results.  2  All items were measured on a seven-point scale (1 = “to a  very small extent” or “strongly disagree” to 7 = “to a very  large extent” or “strongly agree”).

As   the environment of many companies becomes more chaotic, the   exploration of organization forms characterized by flexibility   and adaptability has been intensifying. When reviewing existing   literature on new organization forms, several gaps become ap-  parent. These gaps can be traced back to the artificial separation   between the macrolevel and the firm level of analysis and the   prevalence of a static notion of form. To contribute to a more   encompassing theory of new organization forms, a coevolu-  tionary perspective is suggested. In this perspective, contextual   variation of macrolevel management logics is proposed as a key   mediator in the coevolution of organization and environment.   At the firm level, the contextual variation of management logics   is reflected in shared managerial schemas underlying strategic   design actions. The resulting coevolutionary model shows how   contextual applications of management logics may be a source   of variation in new organization forms. On the basis of a lit-  erature review, three management logics, representing ideal   types, are described: classical management logic, modem man-  agement logic, and postindustrial management logic. These log-  ics are related to three levers of design actions which reflect   fundamentally different interventions in form. Linking man-  agement logics to design levers results in a set of propositions   to be tested in future empirical research.   (Coevolution; Shared Managerial Schemas; Organiza-  tion Form; Management Logics)   Introduction   In the field of organization theory, many scholars have   discussed the topic of organization form. Organization   form has been described as an important management   tool for aligning organization and environment by ". . .   integrating the enterprise's existing resources to current   demand" (Chandler 1962, p. 383). In recent publications,   several developments in the business environment are in-  dicated as triggers for reconsidering existing forms. In-  creasingly changing competitive forces have spawned ex-  perimentation with new organization forms that enable   managers to deal with complexity and dynamics. A num-  ber of organization forms characterized by the ability to   adapt and learn have been discussed (Ilinitch et al. 1996;   Quinn et al. 1996; Volberda 1996, 1998).   As the environment is traditionally conceived as a pri-  mary source of change in organization forms, a large   body of literature exists on the relationship between en-  vironment and form characteristics at a macrolevel. A   well-established stream of research in contingency the-  ory, for example, has examined organic forms adapted to   highly complex and dynamic environments (Burns and   Stalker 1961, Duncan 1972, Lawrence and Lorsch 1967).   Furthermore, selection theories emphatically relate the   emergence of new organization forms to environmental   developments at the population level (Hannan and   Freeman 1989). Both contingency and selection theories   directly link specific form characteristics to environmen-  tal conditions without considering the intermediate design   process. Only part of the differences in organization form   between firms, however, can be explained by the state of   the environment (Lewin and Stephens 1994). We there-  fore suggest a coevolutionary perspective on new orga-  nization forms which considers ". . . organizations, their   populations, and their environments as a joint outcome of   managerial actions, institutional influences and environ-  mental phenomena" (Lewin et al., this issue). Several   variables can be distinguished that shape the design pro-  cess and thereby the emerging organization forms.

DIJKSTERHUIS, FRANS A. J. VAN DEN BOSCH, AND HENK W. VOLBERDA Organizational Forms   reflected in shared managerial schemas at the firm level   is considered as a primary mediating variable. Coevolu-   tion then refers to the combined outcome of managerial   intentionality-in terms of strategic design actions de-   rived from a certain type of management logic (Daft and   Lewin 1990, McKelvey 1997)-and environmental ef-   fects. To provide an explanation with respect to the im-   pact of management logics and contextual variation on   new organization forms, the design process is included in   the analysis.   The paper is structured as follows. After introducing a   coevolutionary framework of new organization forms, its   main building blocks are discussed in more detail. Be-   cause the impact of management logics and their contex-   tual application (i.e., shared managerial schemas) on the   design process will be analyzed in future empirical re-   search, a set of research propositions is presented. Finally,   restrictions and elaborations of the theoretical framework   are discussed.   The Traditional View Versus a   Coevolutionary Perspective on New   Organization Forms   In organization literature, many scholars describe the   need for managing the environmental turbulence that   firms face. Globalization, increased competition, and ad-   vances in information technology are indicated as impor-   tant factors forcing managers to develop adequate strat-   egies for alignment of organization and environment   (Lewin and Stephens 1993, Volberda 1998). Organization   form has traditionally been recognized as an important   lever of change in the adaptation process (Bums and   Stalker 196 1, Lorsch 1977). While earlier discussions   were dominated by a static view of alignment, most   scholars and practitioners are now applying a more dy-   namic perspective: ". . . environments do not stand still   for organizations to catch up. . ." (Ghoshal and Nohria   1993, p. 24).   An overview of the existing body of literature reveals   certain gaps in the conceptualization of new organization   forms. First of all, theorists discuss the emergence of new   forms either as a firm-level issue--consequently describ-   ing organizational sources of variation-or as a macro-   level issue, relating particular environmental conditions   to particular organization designs. Inherently, an artificial   distinction between the design process and its environ-   mental context has been put in place. When studying de-   sign variations across firms, this separation prohibits   scholars from deriving a satisfying explanation of differ-   ences within a particular landscape (cf. Lewin and   Stephens 1994, p. 183). Only part of the design variations   can be explained by the state of the environment, as firms   operating in the same context often show substantial dif-   ferences in their respective forms. Secondly, despite the   development of a more dynamic approach of alignment,   the notion of new organization forms as static solutions   to specific problems is preferred to forms as open-ended   processes (Lester et al. 1998, Nohria and Berkley 1994).   When matching environment and organization form, ap-   propriate design attributes are often presented as end-state   variables or fixed embodiments. This representation does   not fit the growing interest in flexibility and adaptability   as core capabilities of organizations operating in chaotic   environments (Huber 1984; Volberda 1996, 1998). Sev-   eral scholars have stressed the importance of studying the   process in which a new form emerges (Hedberg et al.   1976, Nohria and Berkley 1994, Pettigrew 1997, Roberts   and Greenwood 1997, Van de Ven and Poole 1988,   Slappendel 1996). As Hedberg et al. (1976, p. 41) note,   "designing an organization to fit society's needs implies   that it is less important to discover where an organization   is than to understand how it got there, and where it can   go tomorrow."   With these considerations in mind, we introduce a co-   evolutionary perspective on new organization forms that   emphasizes a firm's embeddedness in a broader context   while explicitly taking into account idiosyncratic sources   of variation in organization form (Lewin and Volberda,   this issue). By shifting the focus to coevolution of orga-   nization and environment, the need for organizations to   adapt to changing business landscapes is considered as   well as the impact of organizational actions on the envi-   ronment. More specifically, a coevolutionary perspective   enables us to study the way in which environmental fac-   tors trigger the emergence of new forms and how these   new forms underlie changes in the firm's environment.   A Coevolutionary Framework of New   Organization Forms   Figure 1 shows an explanatory framework of new orga-   nization forms, based upon a coevolutionary perspective   that reflects the multilevel and multidirectional nature of   the joint development of business environments and new   organization forms. We assume that, at different time pe-   riods, different management logics dominate organiza-   tional practice and theory. Management logics are defined   as sets of macrolevel beliefs and values that strongly in-   fluence management practice and theory (cf. Barley and   Kunda 1992). In this paper, it is argued that time- and   place-specific conditions strongly influence the way in   which management logics are applied at the firm level.   We introduce the concept of contextual variation to refer   to the translation of management logics into firm-specific   ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE NO^. 10, NO. 5, September-October 1999 570   MARJOLIJN S.

Shared managerial schemas are   then considered idiosyncratic applications of a single or   multiple management logic(s) that are shared among a   firm's key decision makers. The reverse set of arrows in   Figure 1 indicates the rise and diffusion of organizing   principles and management techniques. Several scholars   have studied the way in which new management practices   arise. They have come up with a variety of management   fashion setters both from within organizations (Galbraith   1980, Huczynski 1993) and from other institutional set-   tings (Abrahamson 1991, 1996). We argue that, regard-   less of the source of innovation, individual firms provide   fertile ground for the development of new practices.   When proven successful, other firms may copy these   practices, thereby contributing to their diffusion and le-   gitimacy. While a substantial body of literature exists on   the emergence of new management logics and on the role   of managerial schemas within organizations (cf. Walsh   1995), the relationship between managerial schemas and   management logics or "grand themes" (Abrahamson   1997, Barley and Kunda 1992, Eastman and Bailey 1998)   remains largely unexplored. The coevolutionary frame-   work of new organization forms aims at offering insights   ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE NO^. 10, NO. 5, September-October 1999   into the multilevel dynamics reflected in the concept of   contextual variation which shapes the emergence, diffu-   sion, and prevalence of new organizing principles.   In line with McKelvey (1997), it is argued that ". . .   coevolutionary effects take place at multiple levels within   firms (microcoevolution) as well as between firms and   their niche (macrocoevolution)." Whereas macrocoevo-   lution is embodied in the link between management log-   ics and shared managerial schemas and in the joint de-   velopment of environment and organization form,   microcoevolution is reflected in the strategic design pro-   cess (see Figure 1). Perceived environmental character-   istics derived from shared schemas of top management   trigger strategic design actions that may lead to new or-   ganization forms. In other words, shared managerial sche-   mas are considered a key factor in strategic design actions   (Daft and Lengel 1984, Hambrick and Mason 1984,   Meindl et al. 1994, Tyler and Steensma 1998). The mul-   tidirectional nature of the design process is apparent in   the interrelatedness of shared managerial schemas, stra-   tegic design actions, and emerging organization forms.   While a set of shared beliefs functions as a context for   strategic design actions, it is also reproduced in these ac-   tions. A similar observation can be made with regard to   the relationship between strategic design actions and new   organization forms. The process of designing and imple-   menting a new organization form is a nonlinear process   of moving back and forth between design actions and   outcomes.   Macrocoevolution: The Role of   Management Logics   To understand the impact of management logics and con-   textual variation on the emergence of new organization   forms, these concepts have to be discussed in more detail.   The concept of management logic as applied in this paper   is related to Barley and Kunda's notion of management   ideology, which refers to a set of assumptions about the   nature of organizations (1992, p. 363). At particular time   periods and in particular contexts, management logics ex-   ist and are embodied in certain dominant design princi-   ples. Abrahamson (1996) pictures the emergence and de-   velopment of management logics as a four-stage process.   First, management techniques that significantly deviate   from the state of the art are created by either theorists or   practitioners. Next, the management fashion setters select   certain innovative techniques that seem promising as so-   lutions to existing problems. The need for new organizing   principles rises due to environmental changes. Abraham-   son mentions sociopsychological and technoeconomic   forces as factors underlying such environmental changes.   571   MARJOLIJN S. DIJKSTERHUIS, FRANS A. J. VAN DEN BOSCH, AND HENK W. VOLBERDA Organizational Forms   The third stage of the fashion-setting process regards the   processing of the newly introduced organizing principle.   Fashion followers have to be convinced of its rationality   and progressive character. Only then will they adopt the   new organizing principles. Finally, diffusion of the prin-   ciple takes place to get managers acquainted with it. Be-   sides sociopsychological and technoeconomic forces,   broad shifts in the intellectual climate of science and logic   have been mentioned as the impetus for the emergence   of new management logics (Eastman and Bailey 1998).   In summary, next to sociopsychological factors ". . . a   variety of (a) economic, (b) political, and (c) organiza-   tional forces opens gaps between organizations' actual   and desired performances. The management-fashion-  setting process brings these performance gaps to collec-   tive awareness and articulates new progressive and col-   lectively acceptable techniques for narrowing these   gaps." (Abrahamson 1996, p. 268). It is important to re-   alize that each of the management logics that has emerged   in the twentieth century can be found in today's thinking   about organizations: ". . . images and practices central to   each rhetoric were gradually institutionalized" (Barley   and Kunda 1992, p. 365).   In the organization literature, several scholars have pro-   vided an overview of management logics (Barley and   Kunda 1992, Eastman and Bailey 1998, Scott 1987,   Volberda 1998). In their descriptions, organization theo-   rists have used different lenses. For example, Barley and   Kunda conceive of management logics as ways to justify   control, which leads them to make a distinction between   five management rhetorics that ". . . have left their mark   on American managerial thought and practice" (1992, p.   364). Eastman and Bailey (1998), however, delineate pat-   terns of rhetorical change based on the way in which the   fact-value antinomy is mediated. They picture formalism,   consensualism, and value-partisanship as three modes of   mediation, each marking a specific time period. Volderda   (1998) categorizes management perspectives by their ra-   tionality concept, environmental approach, and organi-   zational approach. These dimensions underlie our discus-   sion of three idealized management logics: classical   management logic, modern management logic, and post-   industrial management logic. While there is probably   much more variation in management logic due to an id-   iosyncratic dimension of firms, McKelvey (1997) sug-   gests using idealized models as one of the approaches to   the problem of idiosyncrasy in organization science.   These idealized models ". . . compartmentalize phenom-   ena into idealized differentiated components where com-   plexity is simple enough that simple rules might apply."   (McKelvey 1997, p. 365). While the idealized models of   management logic are discussed in an order that reflects   their historical development, it must be emphasized that   each of them is recognized in today's management prac-   tice. Moreover, managers might be observed applying a   blend of all three management logics.   Classical Management Logic. During this century,   theoretical and practitioner-oriented thinking about man-   agement and organizations has been dominated largely   by normative propositions of classical theories. Taken to-   gether, the ideas of scientific management, classical ad-   ministrative and economic theory, and bureaucratic the-   ory provided the theory and rules for the practice of the   classical management logic. Scientific management   (Taylor 1911) provides the rationale for job design by   separating thinking from doing, focusing on the individ-   ual worker as opposed to the group, and stressing eco-   nomic incentives as the sole source of motivation. Clas-   sical organizational theory (Fayol 1949) contributes to the   guidelines for overall design of the organization, such as   the process of dividing the organization into departments,   coordinating the departments, managing the hierarchy,   and so on (Kilmann, 1977, p. 20). Classical economic   theory (Smith 1981) stresses the rationale for pursuing   the single goal of maximization of profits. Finally, bu-   reaucratic theory (Weber 19 10) highlights the rationale   for hierarchical authority relations.   By comparing bureaucracy based on rational-legal au-   thority to the traditional structure, Weber provided the   most sophisticated argument for the legitimization of the   classical management logic. In this logic, organizations   are considered machines-single-purpose mechanisms   designed to transform specific inputs into specific outputs,   and capable of engaging in different activities only if they   are explicitly modified or redesigned for that purpose   (Morgan 1986). Furthermore, the universe has been fre-   quently compared to a hermetically sealed clock. Like the   clock, its behavior was thought to be determined by its   internal structure and the causal law of nature (Ackoff   1981). According to Scott (1987), the classical manage-   ment perspective is a closed rational approach, which por-   trays organizations as tools designed to achieve preset   ends and which ignores or minimizes the perturbations   and opportunities posed by connections to a wider envi-   ronment.   Several ideas from classical management logic can be   found in today's business life. Quality and management   programs that rely on command and control, the use of   linear cause-and-effects mechanisms in the organizing   process, and an emphasis on short-term results are still   common in many contemporary organizations (Kelly and   Allison 1998). Companies such as McDonald's are ba-   sically extensions and improvements of the Tayloristic   ORGANIZATION 1999SCIENCE NO^. 10, NO.5, September-October 572   MARJOLIJN S. DIJKSTERHUIS, FRANS A. J. VAN DEN BOSCH, AND HENK W. VOLBERDA Organizational Forms   principles of division of labor and detailed work proce-  dures (Baden-Fuller and Stopford 1994) as they perfected   a method of delivering a standardized product at low cost.   The thrust of classical management logic and its modern   application is to suggest that organizations can or should   be rational systems that operate in as efficient a manner   as possible. This "technical rationality" consists of in-  strumental and economic criteria (Thompson 1967). The   instrumental criterion requires that specified actions do,   in fact, produce the desired outcome, whereas the eco-  nomic criterion requires that results are obtained with the   least expenditure of resources.   Modern Management Logic. Classical management   logic has been revised several times since it first came   under empirical scrutiny (e.g., Simon 1997, Woodward   1965). In the 1930s, the human relations movement em-  phasized the importance of social relations among orga-  nizational participants (Mayo 1933, Khandwalla 1977).   The human relations movement challenged scientific   management's basic assumptions about job design and   motivation. In the 1940s, Simon (1947) expounded the   concept of bounded rationality, which asserted that the   administrative decision maker had limited reasoning, per-  ceiving, and information-processing abilities. Simon thus   attacked the perfect rationality assumptions of traditional   economists and the universalistic prescriptive character   of classical organization theory. In the 1950s, Trist (1981)   brought the sociotechnical systems viewpoint to bear on   organization behaviour. It stressed that a work group is   subject to social, psychological, technical, and economic   forces. In the mid-1950s Argyris (1957) and McGregor   (1960) developed their models of desirable organizations   in which human needs would be more fully satisfied and   more efficient use could be made of human capital. While   the human relations school sought only to modify clas-  sical organizational theory (Mayo 1933), the behavioral   humanists have been inclined to seek radical change   (Kilmann 1977). Woodward (1965) laid the basis for con-  tingency theory, based upon the observation that differ-  ences in the structures of organizations depend on differ-  ences in the technology they employ. She revealed the   inappropriateness of universal principles of organizations   and brought out their situational character.   Triggered by these critics, a new management logic   appeared halfway through the twentieth century which   recognized the following:   An organization possesses properties of a natural sys-  tem (human relations school) as well as of a rational sys-  tem. Each approach is partially correct, but neither alone   provides an adequate understanding of complex organi-  zations (Thompson 1967);   An organization is an open system, hence indeter-  minate and faced with uncertainty (contingency theory   and sociotechnical systems approach);   An organization is subject to criteria of rationality   and hence in need of determinateness and certainty   (bounded rationality, Thompson 1967).   Modern management logic still views organizations as   multipurpose mechanisms designed to achieve predeter-  mined goals in different environments. The organization   is viewed as an organism that strives to survive. To do   so, it has to adapt to its environment. This adaptation,   however, is based on the prediction of changes and there-  fore is rational from an organizational perspective. This   rationality may be described as "organizational rational-  ity." In contrast with the assumptions underlying the clas-  sical management logic, humans are only "intendedly ra-  tional," as their limited capacities prevent complete   rationality (Simon 1997). In a larger sense, rationality re-  sides in the organization itself, not in the individual par-  ticipants. Rationality resides in rules assuring that partic-  ipants will behave in ways calculated to achieve desired   objectives, in control arrangements that evaluate perfor-  mance and detect deviance, in reward systems that mo-  tivate participants to carry out prescribed tasks, and in the   set of criteria by which participants are selected, pro-  moted, and replaced. The concept of organizational ra-  tionality derives from the way people and jobs fit together   in a fixed design. Just as in the classical management   perspective, emphasis is still placed on control by struc-  tural arrangements. Modern management logic justifies   these arrangements as instruments of rationality: control   is the means of channeling and coordinating behavior so   as to achieve specified goals.   Postindustrial Management Logic. The organiza-  tional rationality of modern management logic contrasts   with the "substantial rationality" view of organizations in   which people are encouraged to reflect on their behavior   and to adjust their actions accordingly (cf. Clegg 1990,   Morgan 1986). Substantial rationality implies that orga-  nizational participants are able to perceive or to experi-  ence reality as a meaningful and coherent whole, giving   sense to decisions and actions within the organization.   Whereas under the control logic, actions are rational be-  cause of their defined place within the whole, substantial   rationality requires actions based on awareness of the   complete situation. Substantial rationality is reflective   and self-organizing; firms built on substantial rationality   possess an inherent ability to reorganize and renew them-  selves in meaningful ways. It is helpful to elucidate the   concept of substantial rationality by using the brain as a   metaphor for organization (cf. Morgan 1986, Garud and   ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE NO^. 10, NO. 5 ,  September-October 1999 573   MARJOLIJN S. DIJKSTERHUIS, FRANS A. J. VAN DEN BOSCH, AND HENK W. VOLBERDA Organizational Forms   Kotha 1994). The brain is a self-organizing system, ca-   pable of responding rapidly to a broad range of external   stimuli. To the extent that we design organizations on   classical or modern management logics, we respectively   develop technical or organizational rationality, where   people are valued for their ability to fit in and contribute   to the efficient operation of a predetennined structure.   Such organizations encourage people to obey orders and   keep their place rather than to take an interest in, chal-   lenge, and question what they are doing. This mode of   organization is sufficient for performing a fixed task in   stable circumstances or changing tasks in predictable cir-   cumstances. When these conditions are violated, how-   ever, organizations designed along these lines encounter   problems. Under changing circumstances, it is crucial that   organizational participants are able to question the appro-   priateness of what they are doing and to modify their   actions to take account of new situations. This requires   an organizing capacity that is "substantially" rational, in   the sense that action manifests intelligence of the relations   within which the action is set: substantially rational action   is not undertaken blindly but in an awareness that it is   appropriate (Morgan 1986). The assumptions underlying   substantial rationality can be referred to as the postindus-   trial management logic. While the premise of modem   management logic is an increasing functional differenti-   ation within organizations (division of labor, linelstaff   distinction, hierarchical differentiation) and management   is considered the central organizing principle, the post-   industrial perspective stresses a reverse process of inte-   gration; a blurring of the boundaries between what, in a   modernist view, would have been recognized as distinct   phenomena (Clegg 1990). In the postindustrial manage-   ment logic, the question of whether organizations are   closed or open systems is not important. Instead, orga-   nizations tend to maintain their existence by opening up   in particular ways to the environment.   The postindustrial management logic should not be   considered as a definitive way to success. Rather, this   logic should be conceived of as one of three idealized   models, each representing an extreme in thinking about   organizations and how they should be managed and de-   signed. Whereas management practices most often show   a mix of ideal types, they provide valuable insights by   indicating key differences in organizations. A recapitu-   lation of the management logics is presented in Table 1.   Contextual Variation   Lewin et al. (this issue) argue that ". . . specific configu-   rations of institutional arrangements will tend to enable   and restrict strategic adaptation options available to or-   ganizations. . . ." Consistent with this consideration, we   suggest that contextual variation refers to industry-level,   country-level, and firm-specific factors that determine the   translation from management logics to firm-specific   shared managerial schemas. Several studies support our   notion of contextual variation. For example, Meyer   (1995) describes how organizing principles derived from   bureaucratic theory have been applied differently in Eu-   rope and the U.S. due to national and cultural particulars:   "[E]uropean institutional-cultural conditions favored a   centralized, hierarchical, obedience-based organizational   form with little uncertainty tolerance emphasizing loy-   alty. In the U.S., by contrast, the primacy of the large   business organization which operated in volatile markets   under the cultural imperative of equality favored flatter,   less hierarchical, and more nearly decomposable organi-   zations in which compliance was based on a temporary   contract" (1995, p. 32). Furthermore, the influence of the   nation-state form of capitalism on managerial schemas   and thereby on management practices has been empiri-   cally investigated and confirmed. Lewin et al. (this issue)   point out that the structure of capital markets in the U.S.   has served to focus managers' attention on maximizing   shareholder value, which has intensified a short-term ori-   entation. In contrast, capital markets in Germany and Ja-   pan favor a longer-term orientation, as the liquidity and   diversity of financial investors in these systems is less   developed. Whereas U.S. capital market conditions   strongly support a classical management logic as it be-   comes apparent in the efficiency-driven, short-term-  oriented actions of Tayloristic managers, capital market   conditions in Germany and Japan give way to a less strin-   gent use of classical management principles. Although   actions of German and Japanese managers may still be   primarily based on classical management logic, its appli-   cation often differs from the U.S. approach (cf. Sakano   and Lewin, this issue). Besides capital market conditions,   Calori et al. (1997) studied the educational system as a   source of difference in managerial thinking and acting   across countries. They state that educational institutions   shape a nation's beliefs about "how things ought to be   done." This may contribute to contextual variation at the   national level: ". . . the administrative approaches used by   managers during merger integration from two nations   partially reflect a national bias" (1997, p. 682). The au-   thors' findings suggest that French managers, more than   British managers, tend to centralize control over a re-   cently acquired subsidiary, which often results in the staff-   ing of key positions with its own personnel.   Because competitive and institutional factors provide   only a partial explanation for firm-level applications of   management logics, we also consider firm-idiosyncratic   ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE NO^. 10, NO. 5, September-October 1999 574   MARJOLIJN S.

VOLBERDA Organizational Forms   Table 1 Management Logics   Management Logic Rationality Concept   Classical management Technical rationality   Modern management Organizational rationality   Postindustrial management Substantial rationality   Source: Volberda (1998)   variables when studying contextual variation. In organi-   zation literature, a number of firm-idiosyncratic variables   can be found. Executives' background, i.e., former career   experiences, education, and socioeconomic roots, is often   mentioned as a firm-level determinant of shared mana-   gerial schemas (Hambrick and Mason 1984, Meindl et al.   1994, Waller et al. 1995, Walsh 1988). A person's back-   ground shapes his or her preferences and thus favors par-   ticular actions. This is confirmed by Lewin and Stephens   (1994) who suggest considering the social-psychological   attitudes of chief executive officers and general managers   as a critical contingency in organization design. Individ-   ual properties of top managers, such as the need for   achievement, locus of control, and tolerance for ambi-   guity, are pictured as a major source of variations in or-   ganization design, as these properties are reflected in   managerial decision making. Another determinant that   underlies firm-specific differences refers to social and po-   litical processes inherent in managerial actions. The way   in which these processes evolve strongly influences   shered managerial schemas (Walsh et al. 1988). Finally,   history of the firm is often described as a firm-specific   determinant of design choices by functioning as a frame   of reference (Daft and Weick 1984, Gr~lnhaug and   Falkenberg 1989).   Microcoevolution of New Organization   Forms   In the previous section, contextual variation of manage-   ment logics was indicated as a source of coevolution. In   this section, we extend the discussion by focusing on the   firm level of analysis. At the firm level, four key elements   are distinguished: perceived environmental characteris-   tics, shared managerial schemas, strategic design actions,   and new organization forms. The multidirectional cau-   salities between these elements indicate the nonlinearity   of the strategic design process as, for example, experi-   mentation with new organizing principles entails moving   back and forward between actions and outcomes.   Perceived Environmental Characteristics. Consistent   with the existing body of literature (e.g., Tung 1979,   Volberda 1998), we consider the state of the environment   ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE NO^. 10, NO. 5 ,  September-October 1999   Environmental Approach Organizational Approach   Closed system Rational system   Open system Rational/natural system   Open/closed system Natural system   a primary source of change in organization forms. Lewin   et al. (this issue) draw on evolutionary theory when link-   ing environmental uncertainty to changes in organization   forms. They suggest two stages of coevolution in a firm's   responses to changes in environmental conditions. During   the first stage, labeled as a period of stochastic uncer-   tainty, changes in the external environment can be ac-   commodated by incremental adaptation of the existing   organization form. In stage two, due to major environ-   mental developments, firms perceive that their environ-   ments are entering a phase of high velocity turbulence   (Brown and Eisenhardt 1998). Many firms are then forced   to adapt themselves to these changing environments to   survive. Attempts to do so may result in new organization   forms characterized by radically new adaptive capabili-   ties. Since this paper focuses on coevolution of environ-   ment and organization form, we use the second stage,   referred to as the chaotic stage, as context for our research   propositions. We do, however, add shared managerial   schemas as a mediating variable for two purposes. First,   it allows for a more comprehensive explanation of dif-   ferences in organization form across firms operating in   the same (chaotic) environment. Second, it contributes to   a coevolutionary theory of new organization forms in   which new forms arise as a joint outcome of managerial   actions that are shaped by shared managerial schemas and   environmental developments.   Shared Managerial Schemas. Socially constructed   reality is defined by a process of interchange in which   perceptions are affirmed, modified, or replaced according   to their apparent congruence with the perceptions of oth-   ers. Weick (1979) describes this process as enactment.   Members of organizations actively form or enact their   environment through their social interaction. A pattern of   enactment establishes the foundation of organized reality,   which in turn affects future enactments. In this cognitive   approach, shared managerial schemas might be defined   as actively developing shared sets of meanings and con-   nections that are continuously being modified as they are   drawn upon and used (cf. Boland et al. 1990). Shared   schemas are reflected in the basic assumptions underlying   managerial actions and are therefore considered to be an   575   MARJOLIJN S. DIJKSTERHUIS, FRANS A. J. VAN DEN BOSCH, AND HENK W. VOLBERDA Organizational Forms   idiosyncratic characteristic of organizations. They are   preserved and legitimized in a cultural web of organiza-   tional actions in terms of myths, rituals, and symbols   (Johnson 1988). Various scholars have included shared   schemas as a primary contingency in the evolution of or-   ganization forms (Barr et al. 1992, Meyer et al. 1993,   Tenbrunsel et al. 1996, Weick 1979).   It is important to point out that our notion of shared   managerial schemas differs from the dominant logic con-   cept of Prahalad and Bettis (1986, 1995) in several ways.   Prahalad and Bettis define dominant logic as ". . . the way   in which managers conceptualize the business and make   critical resource allocation decisions. . ." (1986, p. 490).   While shared managerial schemas are conceived as ac-   tively developing sets of meanings, the relation between   environment, dominant logic, and organization form is   pictured as a relatively stable. The interrelatedness of   thought and action (Giddens 1979, Weick 1979) remains   largely unexplored. In this paper, however, managerial   schemas are described as an integrative part of the design   process. They are considered the medium of action as   well as its product. Moreover, while Prahalad and Bettis   believe that dominant management logic is primarily   shaped at the firm level, we describe shared managerial   schemas as a function of both firm-level factors and ma-   crolevel variables.   Strategic Design Actions. A study on the role of   shared managerial schemas in the design process requires   a unit of analysis which functions as a point of reference.   In the explanatory framework, the strategic design action   is the key unit of analysis. To categorize strategic design   actions the concept of nodes and links is applied (cf.   Grandori 1997). Nodes are defined as organizational ac-   tors. Links are the interaction processes between nodes   that underly the significance of these nodes. A strategic   design action will be referred to below as a change in one   or more dimensions of nodes and links, having a sub-   stantial impact on a wide range of organizational subsys-   tems. We suggest three dimensions of nodes and links:   number, position, and content. The first dimension, num-  ber of nodes (size) and links (density), relates to number   of organizational actors within a firm and number of en-   during relationships between these actors. The second di-   mension, position of nodes and links, refers to how or-   ganizational actors are linked to each other, which is   determined by allocation of resources and formal rules.   Finally, the content dimension relates to properties of   nodes, such as capabilities and attitudes of organizational   actors, and properties of links, such as nature, content,   and directionality of information and knowledge flows   (cf. Van Wyk and Van den Bosch 1998). The three di-   mensions give way to the categorization of strategic de-   sign actions in three levers of change (Table 2).   In the 1980s, top managers of many large corporations   started to reduce costs by cutting management layers and   discharging personnel. In terms of nodes and links, top   management changed the size and density of their orga-   nizations by decreasing the number of nodes and links.   In addition to downsizing and expansion activities, re-   positioning events have generally received much atten-   tion in both theory and practice. The repositioning or re-   structuring of nodes has been considered an effective way   to align organization and environment. For example, a   shift from a functional structure to a matrix structure em-   bodies the repositioning of nodes and links in order to   attain renewed alignment. While design actions affecting   the number and position of nodes and links are fully em-   phasized in organization literature, the content dimension   has been largely overlooked (Bartlett and Ghoshal 1990).   The distinction between number, position, and content is   consistent with a primary development in the conceptu-   alization of organization form found in organization lit-   erature. While the classical notion of form refers to formal   structural dimensions (Hage and Aiken 1967, Pugh et al.   1968), more recently scholars have started to broaden the   definition by including variables like communication   (Fulk and DeSanctis 1995), culture, and decision-making   norms (Daft and Lewin 1990). The shift toward a multi-   dimensional conception of organization form might be   attributed to the problem of insufficient variety (cf. Meyer   et al. 1993). As Grandori (1997, p. 29) argues, ". . . the   variety of governance forms that are theoretically de-   scribed and assessed is too low with respect to the ob-   served variety in economic life." Meyer (1995) refers to   the same problem when stating that the excessive concern   with rationality that characterizes research on bureaucra-   cies may be due to the neglect of cultural and national   particulars of organizations. Adding the content variable   to more traditional form aspects such as size, density, and   structure enriches the discussion on organization form.   New Organizatiorz Forms. Our coevolutionary model   links new organization forms back to the environment.   Triggered by perceptions of changing environments and   by changed shared managerial schemas, radical innova-   tions in organization form that prove to be successful may   subsequently influence the environment as other organi-   zations start developing similar forms and management   practices. New management practices within GE, for ex-   ample, that were based upon a changed managerial   schema drove the organization's revitalization process,   resulting in a new organization form. The new schema   was apparent in concepts, such as the Boundaryless Or-   ganization (Ashkenas et al. 1995, Tichy and Sherman   ORGANIZATION 1999SCIENCE NO^. 10, NO. 5 ,  September-October 576   MARJOLIJN S.

GE's perspective has had great in-   fluence on competitors' behavior as it changed industry   recipes. Variation in shared managerial schemas thus re-   sulted in the emergence of a new organization form that   changed the business landscape as other firms copied   GE's management practices. The example shows that   coevolutionary processes between a firm and its environ-   ment (macrocoevolution) and within a firm (microco-   evolution) are inextricably bound up with each other   which leads to the following propositions:   PROPOSITION1 a. Macrocoevolution: In the process   of coevolution, variations in shared managerial schemas   due to industry and country differences are likely to give   rise to new managerial logics if they become increasingly   institutionalized in new organization forms.   I b. PROPOSITION Microcoevolution: In the process of   coevolution, variations in shared managerial schemas   due tojirm-idiosyncratic differences are likely to give rise   to new managerial logics i f  they become increasingly in-   stitutionalized in new organization forms.   In this paper, it is argued that firms confronted with a   shift from a stochastic to a chaotic environment most   probably start applying more intense exploration strate-   gies, which results in a different exploitation/exploration   ratio (Levinthal and March 1993). Contextual applica-   tions of management logics function as a primary medi-   ator in the design process and influence the direction of   change in the exploitation/exploration ratio. Top man-   agement of large firms like IBM (ongoing reorganizations   resulting in a 13% reduced headcount by 1993), Xerox   (numerous reorganizations in the 1980s), and Philips   (launching of the Centurion project in 1990, resulting in   the elimination of 67,000 jobs over a three-year period)   have restructured their organizations using a slash-and-   burn approach, cutting staff to the bone and rationalizing   their portfolios without supporting promising new lines   of business. The enforced corporate anorexia made these   companies thinner and, due to a focus on exploitation,   more efficient, but did not really make them more ex-   plorative (Hamel and Prahalad 1994, Volberda 1998).   The strategic design actions implemented by these firms   reveal a preoccupation with number of nodes and links   (see Table 2). In these cases, organizational size and den-   sity as levers of change were preferred to position and   content levers of change. Perceiving the organization as   a machine, employees as variable costs, and the purpose   of organizations as maximizing profits underlies the pri-   mary focus on number of nodes and links. The emphasis   on highly differentiated, deskilled jobs and tight employ-   ment relations-also considered characteristic of classical   management logic-enforced the preoccupation with   quantitative measures. These quantitative measures, like   productivity measures, limit exploration of future oppor-   tunities that are unrelated to current performance (cf. Van   den Bosch et al., this issue). Based upon these consider-   ations, a second proposition is formulated:   PROPOSITION2. When exploring new organization   forms in a chaotic environment, contextual variation   among jirms applying a classical management logic is   likely to be characterized by number of nodes and links.   In contrast with classical management logic, modern   management logic is based on the need for adaptation to   the environment. Since emphasis is placed on structural   arrangements and on the way people and systems fit to-   gether in a fixed design, strategic design actions associ-   ated with modern logic often reflect changes in the po-   sition of nodes and links. For example, transforming a   functional structure into a divisional structure requires the   repositioning of nodes and links. Another example ad-   dresses the decentralization of responsibilities and   thereby the repositioning of authority lines (links). In re-   cent years, the ability to achieve decentralization has been   greatly advanced through highly technical management   systems, such as management by objectives (MBO), plan-   ning, programming, and budgeting (PPBS), or program-   evaluation review techniques (PERT), all developed and   ORGANIZATION 1999 577SCIENCE NO^. 10, NO.5, September-October   MARJOLIJN S.

In particular,   ". . . MBO is now often used to impose a mechanistic   system of goals and objectives on an organization. These   are then used to control the direction in which managers   and employees can take the organization, e.g. through the   development of performance targets consistent with these   goals" (Morgan 1986, p. 29).   PROPOSITION3. When exploring new organization   forms in a chaotic environment, contextual variation   among jirms applying a modern management logic is   likely to be characterized by position of nodes and links.   In addition to number and position, managers may direct   their attention toward content of nodes and links. These   managers focus on software in addition to hardware as-   pects of the organization. Top management of large cor-   porations such as GE and ABB have not only restructured   their corporations but also tried to change the corporate   cultures (Tichy and Sherman 1994). Philip's Centurion   started with an efficiency drive but was followed by a   cultural revitalizing module (Volberda 1998). An even   more radical cultural change was attempted by ABB,   which developed a 21-page "Mission, Values, and Pol-   icy" booklet when it formed its global matrix structure   (Barham and Heimer 1998).   Craig's (1996) study of the Japanese brewing industry   reveals the importance of the content of nodes and links   as a lever of change for management. As a response to   the changed business environment in the 1980s, Japanese   brewers fostered innovation while using a bureaucratic   structure. An exclusive focus on the number and position   of nodes and links would have explained only part of how   the Japanese brewers were able to increase the level of   innovation. The corporate culture and employee attitudes   had to be changed in order for the bureaucratic systems   to function properly. Burt (1997) more explicitly points   out the importance of including the content dimension in   the discussion of new organization forms. As he argues,   "[Tlhe shift from a unitary to a multidivisional form of   hierarchy is easy to see [. . .] as a change in the formal   structure of fisms. The shift from hierarchy to network   organization is more difficult to see in the same way be-   cause the change is not structural so much as procedural"   (Burt 1997, p. 360). By focusing on content aspects, like   employee attitudes, norms and beliefs, and interaction   processes, such changes are incorporated in the study of   new organization forms. Finally, Adler and Borys (1996)   describe two types of bureaucratic organizations that dif-   fer in their content dimension. While the enabling bu-   reaucracy is characterized by the use of procedures that   allow people to gain understanding of the logic underly-   ing work processes, the coercive bureaucracy applies pro-   cedures that ". . . are formulated as lists of flat assertions   of duties" (1996, p. 72). By showing the impact of these   types of formalization on the attitudes of organizational   members, the authors emphasize the importance of reach-   ing beyond the structural attributes toward content vari-   ables.   PROPOSITION4. When exploring new organization   forms in a chaotic environment, contextual variation   among$rms applying a postindustrial management logic   is likely to be characterized by content of nodes and links.   Three Design Strategies   In principle, all three management logics can be a source   of new organization forms that help to survive in a chaotic   environment. In organization literature, this is indicated   as equifinality. Nonetheless, the classical management   logic will be relatively restrictive in the exploration pro-   cess of new forms as it emphasizes exploitation. We   might even argue that firms that favor the classical man-   agement logic are selected out at increasing rates as the   environment becomes more turbulent. The modern man-   agement logic and postindustrial management logic, how-   ever, show an external and longer-term focus, providing   a more extensive basis for exploration that is likely to   increase a firm's absorptive capacity (Van den Bosch et   al. this issue). We can illustrate this by describing three   design strategies: downsizinglexpanding, restructuring,   and reconfiguration. Figure 2 shows the possible design   trajectories firms go through when confronted with new   competitive landscapes, that is, with a shift from a sto-   chastic to a chaotic environment.   We assume that in stochastic environments the focus   is on exploitation of organization forms, while in a cha-   otic environment the emphasis is on exploration of or-   ganization forms. For fisms in which managers apply a   variation of classical management logic, exploration of   fosms is most limited as it is mainly focused on number   of nodes and links. In Figure 2, Proposition 2 is depicted   as the vertical arrow P2. When these firms are confronted   with new chaotic landscapes, the chances of survival are   relatively low. Only those organizations will survive that   maximally exploit downsizing andlor expanding advan-   tages (left corner below in Figure 2-low exploration,   high exploitation). For firms applying the modern man-   agement logic, the exploration process is primarily based   on position of nodes and links (P3). When confronted   with chaotic environments, such fisms will survive when   they, to some extent (medium to high), exploit reposi-   tioning advantages (e.g., transformation of structure type)   ORGANIZATION 1999SCIENCE NO^. 10, NO. 5, September-October 578   MARJOL1JN.S.

Finally,   for firms with a postindustrial management logic, the ex-   ploration process is most extensive, which increases their   chances of survival in a chaotic environment. Only those   firms that do not exploit these configuration advantages   are likely to face difficulties (right upper box in Figure   2-high exploration and low exploitation). We come up   with the following proposition for future research:   PROPOSITION Chaotic environments are likely to 5.    result in an increasing application of postindustrial man-   agement logic by jirms.   In Figure 2, two dotted arrows reflect a shift away from   the classical management logic toward the modem and   postindustrial management logic. When confronted with   a chaotic environment, firms applying the classical man-   agement logic are likely to change their logic as it be-   comes less appropriate. The concept of learning offers   clarification with regard to a firm's changes in manage-   ment logic over time. When a substantial gap emerges   between external conditions and the applied management   logic or, as Weick (1979) puts it, between the territory   and the map, this logic no longer offers the appropriate   context for learning. The replacement of the core as-  sumptions underlying existing learning processes is in-   dicated as deutero learning (Argyris and Schon 1978). In   Figure 2, this corresponds with a horizontal movement   from one column to another.   ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE NO^. 10, NO. 5, September-October 1999   Discussion   In this paper, a coevolutionary perspective was suggested   which emphasized the multilevel and multidirectional   character of new organization forms. An explanatory   framework provided a more comprehensive explanation   of form variations between companies. The contextual   variation of management logics was represented by the   concept of shared managerial schema as a primary me-   diator in the design process.   The coevolutionary perspective and its underlying as-   sumptions place at least two restrictions on the research.   A first restriction refers to the distinction between three   ideal types of management logics. This distinction reflects   just one way to categorize management logics. Additional   logics and even emerging management logics can be   found. The management logics that were used, however,   represent managerial values we consider to be relevant   for understanding today's business practices. Second, it   has been assumed that top management is the key deci-   sion maker in strategic design issues. The sole focus on   top management has been introduced for practical rea-   sons. It might however prove useful to extend the analysis   to emergent design actions initiated by lower level man-   agement (cf. Burgelman 1983).   This paper offers various opportunities for further elab-   oration. One possibility regards the distinction between   organization structure and form. Organization form has   been viewed as a multidimensional concept. The position   or structure of nodes and links was complemented by the   number and content dimensions of nodes and links.   Within the discussion of new organization forms, the dis-   tinction between structure and form, as indicated in this   paper, can contribute to the evaluation of their novelty   and added value in both theory and practice. We speculate   that new forms score high on the content lever of change   (cf. Grandori 1997). The question of how these new forms   differ in terms of the three dimensions of nodes and links   might prove interesting. A second elaboration of the   model regards the level of analysis. Thus far, the firm has   been the main focus. In large diversified corporations,   divisions are headed by separate management teams, each   applying different managerial schemas. The model may   prove useful in analyzing the intrafirm differences with   regard to managerial schemas, strategic design actions,   and the creation of new forms.   A third elaboration of the model has to do with the   analysis of the dynamics of the different design strategies   as depicted in Figure 2. Different movements in the ma-   trix subdivided into horizontal and vertical movements   are possible. Vertical movements take place within an   existing management logic involving further refinements   of the particular application (single-loop learning) or a   579   MARJOLIJN S. DIJKSTERHUIS, FRANS A. J. VAN DEN BOSCH, AND HENK W. VOLBERDA Organizational Forms   shift toward another application of the same management   logic (double-loop learning). Horizontal movements in   the matrix are often more difficult because they involve   expanded searches that are associated with abandoning   inert management logics. This is similar to deutero learn-   ing. Horizontal movements may positively influence a   firm's determinants of absorptive capacity (Van den   Bosch et al., this issue). Finally, an interesting issue for   future research is the deliberate strategic effort to broaden   a firm's shared managerial schemas. Our framework sug-   gests that firms exposed to a variety of different national   environments may benefit from the contextual variations   involved and thereby increase the ability to change their   managerial schemas (Whittington et al., this issue). Sim-   ilarly, multinational enterprises that consider contextual   variation as a threat, or try to ignore it, may limit the   ability to change their shared managerial schemas. To the   extent that these assumptions are valid, we suggest that   multinational enterprises considering contextual variation   as a strategic challenge are likely to be more involved in   creating new organization forms. This is consistent with   the argument of Whittington et al. (this issue) that inter-   national business can be expected to become more in-   novative.   In conclusion, referring to our initial question-  "Where do new organization forms come from?'-we   argue that the coevolutionary model of new organization   forms adds new insights into the managerial design pro-   cess that have remained largely unexplored in the litera-   ture. Contextual variation of management logics is an im-   portant source of coevolution. Organizational adaptations   executed by managers will reflect the managerial schema   they apply regardless of the rate of change in the envi-   ronment. Managers should therefore become more aware   of the management logic they apply. As our design tra-   jectories showed, the contextual application of a specific   logic may indicate the chances of survival in chaotic en-   vironments.

in   depth  why  management  matters  most  By Henk W   Volberda and   Frans A J van   den Bosch,   RSM Erasmus   University  37eBF issue 22, autumn 2005   d  utch innovation performance and productivity   growth is falling behind. Dutch businesses are   focusing on restructuring and cost reductions.   Dutch politicians have been too concerned with   short-term government expenditures. Research   at Dutch universities is failing to fuel the knowledge economy.   On top of these rather worrying factors, the position of the   Netherlands in the Global Competitiveness Index of the World   Economic Forum is disappointing. The Netherlands has fallen   from the top ten – and this could have serious consequences   for the Dutch welfare state.     The Dutch innovation debate so far has concentrated on   technology-related macrovariables, like below-average private   investment in R&D or the low numbers of available scien-  tists and engineers. The central thought is that for a small   country to innovate, it should invest in only a few promising   core technologies, such as nanotechnology or biotechnology.   Particularly striking is the strong bias towards technological   innovation and the total ignorance of what Daft (1978) called   “administrative innovation”.   But there is strong evidence from around the world that   managerial capabilities and organising principles, not just   technological know-how, are key to innovation. One can think   of Richard Branson’s superior visioning ability, which has   enabled him to understand the future evolution of markets   and technology, and create new opportunities to serve both   current and new customers. Other examples are the superior   “industry foresight” of Dell (direct delivery without intermedi-  aries in the PC market), Ikea (direct delivery and self-assembly   by the client in the furniture market), Xerox (paperless office)   and Southwest Airlines (cost efficiency and focusing on a   When a country or a company starts to   fall behind in innovation performance and   productivity growth, its leaders should   focus on developing new managerial   skills rather than chasing promising new   technologies. The current dilemma facing   the Netherlands is a classic case.  Ill  us  tr  at  io  n:   Fr  az  er   H  ud  so  n  particular value chain in the airline business). These examples   highlight how the ability of top management to imagine the   future – and develop capabilities to meet that future – can lead   to competitive advantage.    Expanding worldwide competition, fragmenting markets   and emerging technologies are forcing established firms to   renew themselves continuously by transforming stagnant   businesses and creating new sources of wealth. Hamel and   Prahalad (1994) contend that instead of “more of the same”   or “try harder” approaches (how to be better), organisations   should fundamentally reconsider their core activities (how to   be different).   Building managerial capabilities   The first step lies in mobilising “dynamic capabilities”. The key   attributes of dynamic capabilities are (Volberda, 1998):  • Broad knowledge base: The ability to combine knowledge   from across different core technologies often distinguishes   innovative companies. Take 3M, for example. When consumer   research showed that customers complained about rusting   steelwool pads, experts from 3M’s adhesives, abrasives, coat-  ings and non-woven technologies divisions got together to   create Never Rust plastic soap pads.   • High absorptive capacity: The ability to recognise the value   of new, external knowledge from beyond the periphery of the   firm, assimilate and apply it to commercial ends is crucial.   • Broad managerial mindsets: Managers must have the abil-  ity to identify and support new ideas. By relying on routines,   managers concentrate on their own specialised areas and   avoid the need to construct new activities. Consider the expe-  riences of firms such as NCR, for example. Due to its contin-  ued focus on established lines of business (electromechanical   cash registers) and its reluctance to experiment, NCR was   outperformed by others. Likewise, Sharp was able to develop   dynamic capabilities in the electronic calculator industry while   TI was held back by its limited managerial mindsets, which   were narrowly focused on the semiconductor market.   • High-level learning: Dynamic capabilities, such as flexible   manufacturing or fast product development, cannot be pur-  chased off the shelf but require strategic vision, development   time and sustained investment. They take time to identify,   nurture and leverage, and tend not to be the kind of assets   that managers can turn on or off. Dynamic capabilities must   be built rather than bought. Skill acquisition and learning are   fundamental issues.   managerial roles in capability development   Developing dynamic capabilities is not exclusively the role of   the manager. While managers do indeed dominate this process   in many situations, every employee participates in principle.   Identifying and building capabilities is traditionally viewed   as a hierarchical process with the CEO and top management   playing a central role. Examples of such a top-down approach   include GE’s corporate revitalisation, guided by its CEO Jack   Welch, and Philips’ corporate change initiated by Jan Timmer   and further accelerated by Cor Boonstra. What is unique   about these companies is the fact that their CEOs drove the   entire process of capability development, starting by introduc-  ing new concepts, communicating them in an understandable   manner. New capabilities such as speed, simplicity and market   responsiveness were consequently passed down the organisa-  tion almost as an order or instruction to be followed.   Not every firm, however, can simply copy this top-down   approach, given that strategy in large complex firms is often   less centralised. Perhaps the most effective process of capa-  bility development is through originating, developing and pro-  moting strategic initiatives from front-line managers lower   down the organisation. Front-line managers typically have   the most current knowledge and expertise and are closer to   the sources of customer information critical to new capabili-  ties. Prahalad and Ramaswamy (2003) refer to these kinds of   innovation as “co-creation”. An example of a more bottom-up   process of capability development can be found in 3M. In this   highly innovative firm, the role of top management is limited   to sponsor, coach or mentor; innovation clearly derives from   initiatives at the bottom. Not surprisingly, the names of suc-  cessive CEOs at 3M are relatively unknown, while the inven-  tors and “intrapreneurs” of the lower levels of the company   have received the most attention (for example, Scotch tape,   invented by Dick Drew; or Post-It Notes, by Art Fry).   A shared ideology can help facilitate capability develop-  ment among various parts or subcultures of the company by   specifying broad, tacitly understood rules. Japanese com-  panies like Canon and Honda try to enhance cross-cultural   capabilities through dialogue, camp sessions or brainstorm-  ing seminars held outside the workplace, and even drinking   sessions. Hewlett-Packard’s corporate values like trust and   respect for individuals, uncompromising integrity and team-  work (the HP Way), or 3M’s culture of tolerance for failure and   bias for action, helped these firms to easily develop capabili-  ties for innovation.   organising principles  Three organising principles must underpin any innovative   organisation (Volberda and Lewin, 2003). First, the internal   rate of change must equal or exceed the external rate of   change (competitors, technology, customers etc). This implies   a keen awareness that co-existing rivals trigger each other’s   adaptations. Organisations that have historically been exposed   to more competition are likely to have developed greater   capabilities for regulating their internal rate of change.   Firms that can build to order, leapfrog their competitors   in new product introductions or improvements or detect   and exploit emerging trends ahead of their competitors are   examples of this. 3M, for instance, continually reassesses the   barriers to innovation that tend to develop over time. To avoid   stagnation or rigidity, it has a formal goal of having 30 per   cent of its sales derived from products that are new or have   been substantially modified in the past four years. HP and   Motorola are also pursuing structures and cultures that are   more focused on building new competencies. Like 3M, these   companies decentralise decision-making at the team and divi-  sional level, and encourage spin-off projects. For example, 70   per cent of HP’s sales are represented by products introduced   or substantially modified in the past two years.   Second, innovative organisations optimise self-organi-  sation. This does not mean, however, that individuals or   units can pull in all directions at will or break all the rules.   But it does mean that no central controller is necessary.   This approach requires a fundamental departure from the   command-and-control philosophy of traditional, hierarchical   bureaucratic organisations.   Third, innovative organisations balance innovation and   knowledge creation (exploration) with improvements in pro-  ductivity and processes improvements, efficiency and product   enhancements (exploitation). Levinthal and March (1993) con-  tend that the long-term survival of an organisation depends   on its ability to “engage in enough exploitation to ensure   the organisation’s current viability and engage in enough   exploration to ensure its future viability”. Most firms seem to   exhibit an asymmetric preference for short-term exploitation   improvements. Corporate icons such as GM, IBM, Xerox and   DEC have fallen into this trap. They became “prisoners” of   their deeply ingrained routines and seemingly irreversible,   fixed assets, turning their formerly distinctive competencies   (big cars, mainframe computers, copiers, minicomputers) into   obstacles to changing direction.   These three principles require continuous attention. It is   exactly this feature of continuous attention that distinguishes   successful, long-lived organisations that are permanently   able to innovate from the non-innovating organisations with   a short-term exploitation focus.   Demanding environments and strategic regulations  How can these managerial capabilities and organising prin-  ciples of innovation be enhanced within Dutch private and   public firms? In this section we will discuss the creation of   demanding internal and external “selection” environments   for innovation and the design of strategic regulations condu-  cive to innovation.   Selection environments create the context in which inno-  vations are assessed on their viability and their expected   contribution to competitive advantage. Prevailing bench-  marks regarding profitability, incentive structures and power   relations determine which innovative processes, products   and services are selected. External selection environments   consist of various “actors” including: (a) customers, distribu-  tors and users; (b) suppliers for materials, labour, capital and   equipment; (c) competitors for both markets and resources;   and (d) regulating groups, including governmental agencies,   unions and interfirm associations. In the end, these actors   select successful innovations.   Internal selection environments are located within the   boundary of organisations and determine the variety of new   innovations within the firm. To develop an internal selection   environment conducive to innovation, managers must find   ways to encourage and nurture new ventures and projects.   Johnson & Johnson is an example of a corporation that has   developed mechanisms to set up new units. This encourages   entrepreneurs to pursue their ideas in new separate divisions,   while the older, more established divisions provide continuity   and stability. This system carries costs, such as the difficulty   of integrating the new ideas back into the old organisation.   But it also brings important benefits, as new ideas are typi-  cally insulated from the inertia of the centre, and have the   possibility to flourish without being suffocated.   The great majority of the existing regulations in the   Netherlands do not enable innovation and productivity   38 issue 22, autumn 2005 eBF  Why management matters most  39eBF issue 22, autumn 2005  • The current focus on technological innovation     will not help the Dutch economy regain its      vitality and strength.  • Managerial and organisational innovation   are at least as important as technological innovation for   long-term business success.  • Business cultures that encourage variety, exploration and   self-organisation are needed.  • Top management, government, business schools,   consultants and the general public all have a role to play   in building such cultures.  in   BRieF  “The great majority of the existing   regulations in the Netherlands do not   enable innovation and productivity growth”  growth. In contrast to operational regulations, strategic   regulations should be based on the central idea that “less is   more”. These regulations must create a demanding competi-  tive context, leading to a sustainable competitive advantage   for those firms that are able to comply. Porter and Van der   Linde (1995) have criticised the relationship between regula-  tions and competitiveness as a fixed trade-off, “ecology ver-  sus the economy”, based on a “static view of environmental   regulation, in which every thing except regulation is held   constant”. Indeed, such a view does not take into account the   possibilities of using regulations to foster innovation, produc-  tivity growth and strategic renewal of organisations.  Look at regulation in the pulp and paper industry, for   instance. Regulation in the US forces firms to install costly   end-of-pipe treatment systems. In Scandinavia, however,   regulation permits more flexible approaches, enabling firms   to focus on the sources of pollution in the production process   itself. This approach stimulated Scandinavian firms to develop   innovative pulping and bleaching technologies that not only   met emission standards, but also raised productivity and cre-  ated first-mover advantages for these firms in the industry.   At company level, top management must be involved in   prioritising and continuously assessing managerial capa-  bilities and organising principles. Progress on these mana-  gerial and organisational innovations should be reported.   Shareholders and other stakeholders have to assess their   impact on competitive advantage. Moreover, to improve the   scientific underpinning of methods of assessment, research   institutions, business schools and consulting firms have to   put this issue higher on their agenda. Most innovation tools   and tests have focused on the technological knowledge   base. They have ignored the managerial and organisational   determinants of innovation. Public recognition of major inno-  vations is also clearly needed. Instead of narrowing down   innovation efforts in business to the “big seven” R&D inten-  sive companies in the Netherlands, it is much more challeng-  ing to publish management and organisation rankings on the   outstanding innovation performance of organisations in both   the private and public sector.  rethinking the Dutch innovation agenda   To conclude this essay, we provide five agenda items for   improvement and diffusion of managerial capabilities and   organising principles of innovation in the Dutch economy.     • What do to? Given the under-utilisation of existing knowl-  edge in the Netherlands, investments in the absorption of   knowledge (and its successful application) should have a   higher priority than investments in technological innovation.  • How to do it? Build managerial capabilities (broad knowl-  edge base, absorptive capacity, managerial experimentation,   higher learning) and management roles (hierarchy, teams,   shared norms) to increase the assimilation of knowledge and its   utilisation for innovation. Develop new organisational principles   that increase internal rates of change, nurture self-organisation   and higher levels of exploration and exploitation within firms.  • Who is involved? Top management has to create a proper   organisational context to foster entrepreneurship and innova-  tion. Government agencies have to focus on innovation and   productivity, and enable strategic regulations. Research insti-  tutes, business schools and consulting firms must focus not   only on technological knowledge, but also on managerial and   organisational knowledge.  • For what purpose? The Netherlands has to return to the   ranks of the top ten most innovative and productive countries   in the world.  • How to build enthusiasm for innovation? Create public   awareness and recognition of the societal relevance of out-  standing managerial capabilities and organising principles.   Develop proper assessment tools for innovations in manage-  ment and organisations. Enhance reporting on the progress   of such innovations, and include this information in annual   reports, along with financial indicators.

Market knowledge refers to knowledge associated with targeting cus-  tomer sets, entering markets, distribution channels, marketing approaches and business models.7  New business development is the process of linking the technological and market knowledge  together.8 Although the two types of knowledge are intertwined, their project management require-  ments and implications for the wider organisational context could differ (see Exhibit 1).9  Exhibit 1  Technological versus market knowledge: The case of Polaroid and digital  photography.59  In the 1980s, Polaroid invested heavily in the development of digital technology. Strongly  supported by top management, the project developed leading-edge technological capabil-  ities in digital imaging. The company’s processes and capabilities were geared towards the  development of technological knowledge, which enhanced the successful development of  digital imaging capabilities. However, the company did not become successful in digital  imaging despite the successful development of technological knowledge. The primary reason  was that Polaroid did not recognise the need for the exploration of market knowledge. PolaroidThe distinction between the newness of technological and market knowledge is important for at  least two reasons. First, both types of knowledge reside in different departments (R&D versus mar-  keting/sales). This might have consequences for the autonomy of projects in terms of leveraging  knowledge. Second, the timing of development differs for both types of knowledge. Knowledge cre-  ation involves learning-by-doing.10 Yet, experimenting with market approaches and distribution  channels will take place after market introduction, while practising with products and technologies  is done before market introduction. This suggests that project completion criteria might be differ-  ent for creating technological versus market knowledge.  was at that time very successful in instant photography. Its business model was a so-called  ‘‘razor/blade’’ strategy, in which the firm dropped prices of its cameras to stimulate demand  and subsequently made money on the film. However, digital imaging does not use film and  the company needed new market knowledge in the form of new business models and  distribution channels. Polaroid was also confronted with a new set of competitors, as  (computer) electronics manufacturers also developed digital imaging capabilities. Because  of Polaroid’s dominant managerial cognition and inertial ways of working that were strongly  tied to its existing market knowledge, the company gradually lost its strengths in digital im-  aging and failed to capture the market.  56 Why New Business Development Projects Failincreasing rate. Companies need to develop new business opportunities continuously to tackle tech-  nological and market changes. However, the managerial and organisational structures of most firms  are primarily catered towards exploitation activities such as refining products and processes. These  structures do not support the requirements for exploring new business opportunities.1 Managers  therefore increasingly use projects to create new businesses.  A key aspect of New Business Development (NBD) projects is the management of knowledge.2  Research has shown that project success is enhanced if project management characteristics are  aligned with the project’s activity.3 Previous studies have made a distinction between projects  that develop exploitative or incremental innovations versus exploratory or radical innovations.4  Given the limited insight in the consequences of technological and market knowledge for NBD  projects, we will address the following research question: How does creation of technological and  market knowledge influence project management characteristics of NBD projects? By doing so,  we address the role of projects as focal points of knowledge creation and integration and provide  insights into the conditions for the successful management of NBD projects. We focus our longi-  tudinal research on new business development projects in a large incumbent firm in the consumer  electronics industry.  Our findings highlight that technological and market knowledge should have a different effect on  project autonomy. By doing so, we extend previous research that has focused on the distinction  between exploitative versus exploratory innovations and its effect on project autonomy.11 Second,  building upon Danneels’ work, we show the timing and duration of development differs between  market and technological knowledge.12 Our findings indicate that the creation of market knowledge  is likely to continue after market introduction, i.e. during the commercialisation phase. Extending  the managing-through-projects approach to the commercialisation phase enhances the success of  NBD projects requiring new market knowledge. Third, our research shows that two strategies  can be applied to offset deficiencies in project management. Top management support can be  used to prolong the project approach and to shield the project from organisational pressures to ex-  ploit. Our findings also indicate that strategic alliances with partners possessing complementary  market knowledge significantly shorten the time to acquire new market knowledge for NBD  projects.  Literature review  Innovation is not only the creation of new knowledge, but also the recombination with existing  knowledge.13 The processes of creating new knowledge versus leveraging existing knowledge are re-  ferred to as exploration and exploitation. Exploration is the act of creating knowledge that is new to  the firm through activities such as experimentation, innovation, search and variation. Exploitation is  the act of using knowledge existing in the firm and is associated with implementation, efficiency,  production and refinement.14 NBD projects call for both the exploration and the exploitation of  knowledge.15 Exploration and exploitation require, however, different styles of management and  organisational arrangements.16  Several studies have been investigating how to manage the creation and transferring of knowledge  in the context of new business development.17 Yet these studies did not take into account the effect  the type of knowledge has on managing NBD projects, even though it has been argued that tech-  nological and market knowledge have different outcomes for organisations.18 The benefits of,  among others, cross-functional teams, project autonomy and stage-gated development processes  for the successful management of projects are well established.19 This paper explicitly focuses on  the relationship between project management characteristics and technological and market knowl-  edge. Success rates of NBD projects are enhanced if project autonomy is aligned with the degree of  exploration of projects.20 This suggests connecting project autonomy with the degree of exploration  of technological and market knowledge. Studies have also shown that exploration and project  management practices change over the project’s lifecycle.21 This suggests linking project completion  criteria to the phase in which exploration of technological and market knowledge occurs, as a prime  objective of NBD projects is the creation of new knowledge.  Degree of exploration of technological and market knowledge and project autonomy  The degree of project autonomy influences to what extent the exploration and the exploitation of  knowledge is enhanced. The higher the project’s autonomy, the more precedence the project takes  over various functional areas and the development of its knowledge base.22 A high degree of project  autonomy stimulates the exploration of knowledge, as it shields the project from organisational in-  ertia and knowledge bases.23 At the same time, higher degrees of project autonomy make learning  and transferring knowledge between the project and the organisation more difficult, because of the  relative distance between the project and organisational units.24 Providing low degrees of autonomy  Long Range Planning, vol 41 2008 57  to an NBD project limits the ability to explore new knowledge, but enhances the possibility to le-  verage existing knowledge and resources from the parent organisation.25 Autonomy could, inter  alia, be increased by using heavyweight leaders, by placing a project in physically distinct location,  or by increasing the reporting level.26  Figure 1 depicts a conceptual framework of four idealised types of projects linking the degree of  technological and market knowledge newness to project autonomy. Projects requiring new techno-  logical and market knowledge (see Figure 1, quadrant 1) benefit the most from autonomy, as sep-  arating a project from the organisational context facilitates learning within the project.27 A typical  structure for such radically new projects would be some sort of venture unit.28  Product improvement projects that exploit both existing technological and existing market  knowledge benefit from staying close to the mainstream of the organisation to maximise the poten-  tial for leveraging knowledge already present within the firm (see Figure 1, quadrant 4). For these  projects a functional or lightweight project type is preferred, which receives very little autonomy.29  Project members in this type of project divide their time between ongoing activities in their func-  tional department and the project. As such, these employees are in the best position to leverage  relevant knowledge and resources from their functional departments. Several authors argue that  Existing-  in-the-firm  knowledge  Project autonomy: Medium  Project completion criterion:  Profitability achieved  Project autonomy: Low  Project completion criterion:  Market introduction  A high degree of project autonomy stimulates the exploration of  knowledgeFigure 1. Conceptual framework: knowledge types and project management characteristics  58 Why New Business Development Projects FailNBD project success is significantly enhanced if projects make use of the firm’s existing sales force  and distribution channels.30  Projects exploring technological knowledge and exploiting market knowledge require a medium  degree of autonomy (see Figure 1, quadrant 2). These projects need autonomy for the development  of technological knowledge but need lower degrees of autonomy to exploit the available market  knowledge. We suggest, therefore, an intermediate solution with medium degrees of autonomy  for the project, which leaves room for both exploitation and exploration.  In a similar vein, projects needing exploration of market knowledge and exploitation of  technological knowledge would benefit most from a medium degree of autonomy (see Figure 1,  quadrant 3). Too close co-operation with marketing and sales might constrain the project’s ability  to explore market knowledge, and have a negative impact on project performance.32 This suggests  Market knowledge  New-to-the-firm Existing-in-the-firm  New-to-  the-firm  Exploration of both  technological and market  knowledge  Project autonomy: High  Project completion criterion:  Profitability achieved  1  Exploration of technological  knowledge  Project autonomy: Medium  Project completion criterion:  Market introduction  2Technological  knowledge 3  Exploration of market  4  No exploration of knowledge  that the NBD project needing exploration of market knowledge should receive a certain degree of  autonomy from sales organisations.  Besides exploring new knowledge internally, NBD projects could also use strategic alliances to  develop the missing knowledge and capabilities. Research has shown that partnerships with  complementary resources and capabilities increase chances for success and competitive advantage.33  Using a partnership could speed up the development process and significantly reduce investment  costs.34 Furthermore, it could also solve the potential conflict between requirements of technolog-  ical versus market knowledge in NBD projects, as partners could be responsible for one type of  knowledge, while the project is focusing on the other type.  Phase in the NBD process in which knowledge creation occurs and project  completion criteria  Projects are temporary structures created to achieve a certain goal.35 This suggests defining clear  project completion criteria. NBD projects have the objective to explore new products/technologies,  and/or explore new markets, for the firm.36 Project completion criteria should, therefore, be aligned  with the process of the exploration of technological and market knowledge. Scholars have previ-  ously argued that NBD projects end when a newly-developed product is introduced.37 This view  limits the exploration of both technological and market knowledge to the development phase  preceding market introduction. We argue, however, the exploration of technological and market  knowledge end at different points in time.  Following Thornhill and Amit, we identify three phases in the process of new business develop-  ment (see Figure 2).38 The development phase ranges from the conception of ideas to the introduction  of developed products or services on the market. When products are introduced on the market, the  project enters the commercialisation phase until profitability is achieved (i.e. when cumulative profits  surpass investment costs).39 The final phase is the business phase, when the project has become a busi-  ness and is self-sustainable.  The exploration of technological knowledge is mainly confined to the development phase, with  exploratory technological activities such as product development and building the (trial) produc-  tion line. Before the product is approved for market introduction, the end result of the techno-  logical development trajectory in terms of a working product and process are usually tested on  aspects such as durability and quality.40 At the moment of market introduction, the product  and production line are technically complete, requiring little additional development of techno-  logical knowledge. The subsequent commercialisation phase calls for exploitation of technological  knowledge to increase the efficiency of the production process and refine the product. Hence, pro-  jects needing only the exploration of technological knowledge should be completed after the de-  velopment phase ending at market introduction (see Figure 1, quadrant 2).41  Main focus on exploration of  technological knowledge and start  of exploration of market  knowledge  Commercialisation phase Business phase  Start of the  project  Development phase  Main focus on  exploration of  market knowledge  Market  introduction  Profitability  achieved  Exploration: creating knowledge new to the firm  Exploitation: using and leveraging knowledge existing in the firm  Exploitation  Figure 2. Exploration and exploitation of technological and market knowledge in subsequent phases of an  NBD-project’s life cycle  Long Range Planning, vol 41 2008 59  The exploration of market knowledge also starts during the development phase with activities such  as gaining knowledge about customer preferences and how to reach and target potential customers  (see Figure 2). Yet, exploration requires learning-by-doing, which for market knowledge can to  some extent only be learned during the commercialisation phase when products are actually  tion of top management or a set of special criteria to further explore market knowledge. Conclud-  ing, the different phases in which exploration of technological and market knowledge occurs (see  Figure 2) suggests project completion criteria for NBD projects should be contingent upon the  phase in which exploration of technological and market knowledge takes place (see Figure 1).  Methods  The research reported here is based on an in-depth, longitudinal case study of new business devel-  opment projects at the Domus division of Electra,i a major manufacturer of consumer electronics.  By selecting projects within a single division, we were able to reduce potential confounding effects  of the industry and the firm. This allowed us to observe our phenomena of interest, namely how the  creation of technological and market knowledge and project management practices influence the  success of NBD projects. To observe the changes in organisational behaviour over time and to  gain deeper understanding of the role of technological and market knowledge creation in managing  NBD projects, we choose qualitative methods instead of quantitative methods. The selected method  increases the validity of our study, but at the same time we acknowledge that we might lose possible  generalisation to other industry contexts. We used several rounds of data collection and a variety of  internal company documents such as minutes of meetings and business plans, and external docu-  ments to analyse the projects. We also interviewed several key project members, division executives,  R&D directors and sales managers for the projects to triangulate the findings with different sources.  The projects were selected based on the exploration of technological and market knowledge (see  Figure 3). All projects needed to have reached the commercialisation phase. To measure the degree  of exploration we first asked respondents to what extent the product/technologies and markets were  existing to the firm, new-to-the-firm, industry or world. Second, we asked them to explain what  aspects were new, because something that is new to the firm does not necessarily involve much ex-  ploration. For example, a firm can enter a new market segment, but might use existing distribution  channels and market approaches. Third, we investigated company documents to look for state-  ments on actual explorative behaviour. For instance, if minutes of meetings stated that the project  team was developing medical knowledge to sell its products through pharmacies as opposed to elec-  tronic retail stores, this would be classified as exploration of market knowledge (see also Table 1).  Using multiple sources of evidence allowed us to develop a more fine-grained measure of the degree  of exploration needed than would be possible through survey research. Appendix 1 provides more  detail on our research methods.  Research setting  Electra is a large multinational company that consists of several relatively autonomous product di-  visions. Besides the product divisions, national and regional sales organisations were part of the  company. Because many of Domus’s products are sold through the same retail stores, a single sales  person of Domus offers the whole range of its products to a retail store instead of having different  sales persons for each product line.  i Due to confidentiality agreements, we changed the name of the company.  60 Why New Business Development Projects Failsold. This is a prime difference with technological knowledge creation in which case one can exper-  iment before products are actually sold on the market. The exploration of market knowledge con-  tinues during the commercialisation phase, when for example concepts are tested in the market and  distribution channels are developed. Based also on customer feedback, the market approach might  be frequently changed during this phase.42 NBD projects requiring new market knowledge should,  therefore, only be completed at the end of the commercialisation phase (see Figure 1, quadrants 1  and 3). At the end of this phase, the project has become self-sustainable and does not need protec-  Market knowledge  New-to-the-firm Existing-in-the-firmAt the time of investigation, Domus consisted of a business group focusing on household products  and one focusing on personal care products. The household products group had a diverse product  portfolio, mostly in increasingly saturated markets. Market growth had slowed down to around 2-3  per cent and there was an increasing trend towards commoditisation. Sales growth was mainly  achieved through market share battles, but management recognised opportunities for entering  new markets and for radically redefining the existing product/market propositions. The  personal care products group consisted of a rather narrow, but highly profitable product portfolio  that was also confronted with decreasing sales growth. Yet the opportunities for boosting growth  were markedly different, as growth opportunities were primarily in addressing new product  categories.  Domus consisted of several business units that each contained a few business lines, which con-  sisted of one or more product lines. Units were defined based on relatedness of product (cate-  gories). The business units were responsible for NBD activities. The NBD project managers  reported to a business line manager within these business units. NBD projects within Domus  were crossfunctional, and included both engineers as well as marketers. Domus used heavyweight  projects for the NBD projects we investigated, but with relatively junior managers leading the  projects. The engineers and marketeers were assigned full time to a project and had clear respon-  sibilities toward the project manager, although they formally reported to their functional units.  The projects were organised and the development activities executed according to a standardised  approach that was described in a manual. A senior project manager of Skin pointed out: ‘‘.we  followed a very strict process, which was actually a best-in-class process with all the stages, gates,  and milestones, but this was very much driven from the [technological] development side. On the  marketing-side it was very loose.’’  New-to-the-  firm  Skin (failed)  Health (failed)  Oral (success)  Cook (failed)  1  Hair (success)  Fem (success)  2Technological  knowledge   Existing-in-  the-firm   3  Drink (success)  Air (failed)  4  Outside scope of  this research   Figure 3. Classification of the eight investigated NBD-projectsCase study findings  We investigated eight NBD projects within Domus. These projects were executed during 1993 to  2003. Table 1 presents an overview of the investigated projects. Project Drink developed a new seg-  ment of an existing market, while others targeted a market completely new for Electra (projects  Health and Skin), or focused on markets that were geographically relatively new for the company  (project Cook). Several projects (Drink, Oral and Health) made use of an alliance to build the new  business. All projects fitted within Domus’s defined strategy to manufacture mass electronic con-  sumer goods for household or personal care use. The projects in our sample provided significant  revenues. Projects Hair and Air achieved more than V30 m in annual turnover two years after  market introduction, while project Drink has sold millions of products in the first four years after  market introduction. Projects Fem and Oral have grown into businesses with annual sales well  exceeding V100 m.  Long Range Planning, vol 41 2008 61  Table 1.

All investigated projects and businesses within Domus were in the area of consumer  electronics, indicating relatively similar technological bases. This allowed project teams to build on  existing engineering capabilities to create electronic products for household use. The heavyweight  structure provided projects with sufficient autonomy to create new knowledge, while the project  was still sufficiently integrated with other units to leverage existing capabilities. The projects  used employees from the R&D departments which further facilitated the access to relevant knowl-  edge and capabilities. Project Cook received more autonomy than the other investigated projects.  Instead of the standard approach of developing the project at one of the operational business units,  project Cook was situated in Asia. Being far away from the company’s business units in Europe  limited project Cook’s access to organisational knowledge and support. As a result, the project  had to develop many of the competencies regarding manufacturing and testing the product. It  could not draw on employees from R&D departments, but hired new personnel. This resulted in  long development times and poor initial product quality, which had adverse effects on the project’s  performance.  Although the projects’ degrees of autonomy were adequate for the exploration of technological  knowledge, it did create problems for the exploration of market knowledge. Most projects operated  autonomously from the sales organisations. A sales manager pointed out: ‘‘The BU sometimes de-  veloped things without full commitment and involvement of the sales organisations. There was  a somewhat isolated attitude, in the sense of wait until it is finished and we’ll show you. Here  and there were some walls in the organisation over which something was thrown from time to  time.’’ The task of NBD projects was to explore what should be done regarding the market, in terms  of new distribution channels and new marketing approaches. The sales organisations were respon-  sible for exploitation in the sense that they had to sell the products through the new distribution  channels etc. The sales representatives had, however, neither the time nor the resources to learn  how to sell the developed product through new distribution channels. The projects received time  and resources to search new knowledge, but sales employees did not receive time and resources  to learn and practise. In an interview a business manager of Oral pointed out: ‘‘An important  market for Oral was country X. The average age of the sales employees was around 50 and they  had been selling kitchen appliances for 25-30 years. Could we ask of these sales employees to  suddenly have a talk with specialists about interdental cleaning?’’ This proved to be too difficult  and currently project Oral still has its own sales force and is managed autonomously from other  business units.  Several projects tried to compensate for their lack of market knowledge by engaging in an alliance  with a partner possessing the required knowledge (see Table 1). The business manager of Project  Oral continued: ‘‘That’s one of the reasons we established the alliance and did the acquisition. It  proved too difficult to build up our own competences and network regarding professional endorse-  ment by medical specialists.’’ The alliance partner did have the competences and network. There  was, however, some overlap on the technological side, which led to disputes between both parties  on how certain parts should be constructed and who should develop it. Combined with the some-  what diverging interests and the lack of alliance experience of both companies, this led to the alli-  ance disbanding. Project Drink’s alliance, however, was a major success. Project Drink used a new  business model in which revenues from so-called consumables were the main profit drivers instead  of the core product (recall Polaroid’s razor/blade strategy discussed in the theory section in which  camera prices were kept low to stimulate demand, while the profit was made on the film, i.e. the  consumable). But project Drink had limited experience with selling and marketing these consum-  ables. The partner did have a background in these and took care of developing and selling the con-  sumable, while project Drink handled the development and selling of the core product. This  complementarity made them ideal partners, although establishing the alliance was a long process,  because of the limited experience of Domus with such alliances. The success of this alliance  Long Range Planning, vol 41 2008 63  contributed to the establishment of a corporate alliance office to capture and leverage knowledge on  establishing alliances.  Concluding, the autonomy of the project influenced to what extent projects were able to explore  competencies in Asia. Despite difficulties with testing the product, these projects continued with  market introduction. The pressure to launch quickly led projects Cook, Health and Oral to intro-  duce the products on the market prematurely, resulting in high recall rates.  The exploration of market knowledge also started during the development phase (see Figure 2). A  project manager of project Skin commented on the market research: ‘‘It is a new business, how do  you know how many we can sell? You can improve your guessing with more and better customer  research and knowing how to understand the numbers. The problem was that we did not know how  to interpret the numbers we got back, as we had no data to compare it to.’’ This lack of understand-  ing of the market led to flaws in the project’s assumptions, product positioning and business model,  which came to the surface during the commercialisation phase. The project manager of Skin stated:  ‘‘Two of the major reasons that brought Skin down were marketing and distribution. We found out  that the average time it took a consumer to decide to purchase our product was three months, while  for the average product Domus sold it is more in the area of two days. During that three-month  period you have to get your message out and convince potential consumers, as they will ask every-  body from their friends to their doctor what they think of the product.’’ A former business manager  of Oral also stressed the exploration of market knowledge still taking place: ‘‘The traditional way of  Domus for a market introduction campaign was to execute just one brief mass marketing campaign  and that is it. We had to learn that we regularly had to contact medical specialists to achieve  professional endorsement.’’  64 Why New Business Development Projects Failtechnological and market knowledge, and benefit from knowledge already existing in the firm. As  suggested by the case study, a heavyweight project placed within the operational business units pro-  vides sufficient autonomy to develop new products, but is still able to leverage relevant technological  knowledge and capabilities. If a project receives more autonomy (e.g. project Cook) it needed more  time to develop technological knowledge, as it could not draw on available knowledge, skills and  personnel. Regarding market knowledge, however, the investigated projects were too autonomous  from the relevant sales organisations. By not being involved in the project, the sales organisations  did not receive the time and resources to develop and experiment with novel market approaches.  The case study indicates that strategic alliances are useful to decrease the time it takes to acquire  new market knowledge and the time to achieve profitability. Projects Drink and Oral demonstrate  the impact of such alliances, as they became major successes, while other projects exploring market  knowledge (Air, Skin and Cook) continued their struggle to find the right approach towards the  market.  Phase in the NBD process in which exploration occurs  A major difference between technological and market knowledge is when the exploration takes  place. In our case study, the exploration of technological knowledge took place before market intro-  duction. The product development ended with exposing the products to durability tests, which  were performed before introduction on the market. Production processes were constructed and  many trial runs were done before the project was given the green light to start manufacturing  for first sales. Most projects benefited from testing facilities and capabilities the company already  possessed. For projects Oral, Cook and Health, existing tests were not applicable. A project manager  of project Oral stated: ‘‘A lot of our standard tests were designed for a kitchen environment. Our  product was however used in a bathroom, in which the atmosphere is warmer and moister. We had  to learn how to test for this.’’ Project Cook faced similar problems, as it had to build up testing  Strategic alliances are useful to decrease the time it takes to acquire  new market knowledge  From the case analysis it appears there was hardly any time left to create the required market  knowledge once products had been introduced on the market, because of the imposed project com-  pletion criteria. During the commercialisation phase projects were managed according to criteria  similar to managing existing businesses within Domus. First, projects had to use a mass-introduc-  tion strategy in multiple countries, which a project manager labelled the ‘‘do-it-right-the-first-time  approach’’. A second criterion was that NBD projects had to achieve profitability within two years.  A third criterion stated that projects needed to use their own revenues if they wanted to make ad-  ditional investments in exploration once products had been launched. In other words, projects were  considered to be completed at the moment of market introduction. During the commercialisation  phase these activities were viewed as emerging businesses, which were granted two years to achieve  profitability levels comparable with other businesses. A project manager of Cook pointed out: ‘‘We  performed relatively well on the milestones in the development phase, but that is one of the  strengths of Domus. The bigger project Cook, however, was not handled in a project-like way.  That was more the running of a daily business.’’  Of the eight investigated projects, Fem and Hair were the only two projects that did not need  significant exploration of market knowledge (see Table 1 and Figure 3). These projects became  instant successes, as they benefited from leveraging existing market knowledge bases. The criteria  to view the project as completed at market introduction were aligned with the exploration of tech-  nological knowledge, which took place before market introduction.  Out of the six projects that required exploration of market knowledge, only two became a success.  The four failing projects were seriously constrained by the before-mentioned business criteria  imposed on them during the commercialisation phase. Project Air, for example, used a mass-intro-  duction strategy on multiple markets. After market introduction, the project experienced several  problems with the business model, marketing approach and distribution channels. As a conse-  quence, demand was far lower than expected and 80 per cent of the production capacity remained  unused. The project either needed significant investments to turn the tide or needed to write off the  initial investments and continue on a smaller scale. Yet the criteria imposed by top management did  not allow these options, as projects only got two years to become profitable and were not entitled to  financial support.  The two successful projects (Drink and Oral) managed to offset these project completion criteria  that were not aligned with exploration during the commercialisation phase. Project Drink used an  alliance for the exploration of market knowledge, i.e. the business model and market, and more  importantly used a single test market to explore further if the developed product propositions  and marketing campaigns were effective. An R&D manager pointed out: ‘‘What worked very  well was using a single test market. It created success, which worked positively towards other mar-  kets. The idea was to keep it small, learn and use the experience gained in other markets. Once you  have success it is easier to convince management to invest additional resources for launch in other  countries.’’ The marketing manager of project Drink explained the exploration of market knowl-  edge: ‘‘Through project Drink we learned how to do this. Just testing it in the market and learn  about optimal product positioning, marketing strategies and then executing it on a larger scale.’’  The number of products sold during the first year was three times higher than the most positive  scenario, which shows the advantage of a project approach over a business approach in the case  of exploration of market knowledge during the commercialisation phase.  Project Oral became a success after almost 10 years of experimentation, learning and develop-  ment, resulting in significant investments and losses. The project completion criteria that were  established for NBD projects that reached the commercialisation phase (i.e. becoming profitable  in two years) were, however, overruled by the responsible business manager. A former project man-  ager of Projects Air and Cook commented: ‘‘One of the most important things is creating the right  environment and support for the new business. In personal care for example they committed them-  selves if they spotted an important opportunity. A good example is project Oral. The first five years  were basically a disaster. Everybody in the organisation yelled that we should stop, as our product  quality was inferior compared with the competition. But there was one manager who said these  Long Range Planning, vol 41 2008 65  comments were fine and all that, but the project would continue.’’ The champion had sufficient  authority and resources to allow the project to continue. Other projects needing additional time  to develop the markets also had champions, but the problem was that these champions moved  top management support could overcome misalignment of project completion criteria with the  requirements for new market knowledge.  Discussion of findings: managing NBD projects  The NBD projects in our sample were managed and organised in accordance with a focus on the  In order to succeed in developing new markets, the sales organisationsexploration of technological knowledge. NBD projects were placed in operating business units close  to R&D and engineering departments, which gave them good access to technological knowledge.  The standardised project management approach treated the NBD projects as regular businesses  66 Why New Business Development Projects FailSeveral projects also found that in order to succeed in developing new markets, the sales orga-  nisations had to explore new ways of working. Although the autonomy of the project allowed  the projects to explore freely and develop innovative approaches, it did not result in workable sit-  uations, as the sales force did not get the time or the incentives to learn how to operate successfully  in these new environments. A sales manager commented: ‘‘At that time sales employees were not  rewarded to introduce new products. Our trade partners received incentives to prioritise certain  products, but not internally towards our sales force. Management just provided sales targets for  each product.’’ The consequence was that the sales organisations and the individual sales represen-  tatives favoured existing products over new products, as they required less effort to reach the sales  targets than new products. Because neither the business units and projects nor the sales organisa-  tions received incentives to create the required market knowledge during the commercialisation  phase, disputes arose frequently about who should pay for it. Fem, Hair and Drink were perceived  as logical additions to the product portfolio and did not receive much resistance from the sales  organisations. Cook was also a welcome addition to the product portfolio in the eyes of the sales  organisations, but they did not have the resources to support the market development for project  Cook. On the contrary, one of the objectives of project Cook was to strengthen the sales organisa-  tions in Asia, which is the other way around. Projects Health, Skin, Oral and Air stretched the port-  folio a bit more, as they all had a medical aspect in their business model, and some were a bit more  niche marketing than usual within Domus. As pointed out, in particular the medical side with new  distribution channels and professional endorsement created major challenges for the sales organi-  sations, but no resources were made available to explore.  In summary, the used project completion criteria at Domus to view a project as a business when  the commercialisation phase starts suited the projects primarily needing exploration of technolog-  ical knowledge, i.e. quadrant 2 in Figure 3. NBD projects requiring new market knowledge, how-  ever, would have significantly benefited from a managing-through-projects approach during the  commercialisation phase. Extending the project approach until profitability is achieved might  have led more of these projects to success, because of the available time and resources to develop  knowledge about the intended markets. The case study also points to the importance of including  sales organisations in the project. This provides the project with access to the available knowledge  stock in the sales organisation and points to the relevance of providing sales organisations with time  and resources to explore market knowledge. Our findings indicated that using strategic alliances or  had to explore new ways of workingto positions in other units or divisions. The project manager continued: ‘‘Then you see the impor-  tance of a long-term champion. He was in that business unit for many years, while for other  projects, every couple of years a new business manager arrived.’’  after market introduction. This benefited projects that focused on the creation of technological  knowledge and did not require new market knowledge (projects Fem and Hair). Projects needing  exploration of market knowledge ran into severe problems because they did not receive the auton-  omy, resources and time necessary to develop market knowledge during the commercialisation  phase.44 Several NBD projects requiring market knowledge during the commercialisation phase  began cutting costs and opted for less innovative approaches to achieve profitability within the re-  quired two years. Moreover, top management demanded a launch strategy, in which products had  to be introduced on many markets at the same time. This strategy maximises economies of scale,  but leaves little time to experiment with different approaches.45 In line with our conceptual frame-  work, the case findings highlight that a single approach towards NBD projects does not do justice to  the diversity of projects in terms of their required exploration of technological and market  knowledge.  Managerial implications  Our findings highlight at least four important implications for senior and project management (see  Table 2).  First, senior and project management have to recognise the differences between the exploration  of technological versus market knowledge and match the project’s autonomy to the degree of ex-  ploration of both types of knowledge (see Figure 1). The degree of autonomy a project receives  ment of market knowledge continues after market introduction, these activities should be managed through  projects until profitability is achieved (see Figures 1 and 2).  3) An organisational champion can be used to offset deficiencies in the project’s autonomy and project completion  criteria. However, management support from a champion is often not a sustainable solution because of mana-  gerial job rotation.  4) To speed up the development of market knowledge, projects can use strategic alliances with firms possessing  complementary market knowledge.  5) Align sales force incentives with NBD project requirements. Proactive sales force involvement and the develop-  ment of new sales skills are essential for successfully commercialising NBD projects that require new market  knowledge.  Long Range Planning, vol 41 2008 67should increase when there is a greater need for development of technological and market knowl-  edge. Higher project autonomy facilitates knowledge creation in the project, while tighter links be-  tween the project and mainstream businesses are beneficial if the project wants to benefit from  existing knowledge. This suggests companies should have a range of managerial and organisational  arrangements for NBD activities tied to the specific knowledge requirements of projects, instead of  applying one standardised arrangement to all types of projects.46 Our case findings pointed out that  a standardised approach aligned with exploration of technological knowledge significantly con-  strained NBD projects requiring the development of market knowledge.  Second, management should enable the exploration of market knowledge taking place during the  commercialisation phase by setting project completion criteria that include this phase in the project  (see Figures 1 and 2). This protects the project from increasing business pressures to show early  results, and provides management with the opportunity to experiment with new approaches;  two key aspects for the success of exploratory projects.47 Establishing project completion criteria  provides clarity and a point-of-reference to both the organisational context and the project in terms  of when exploratory behaviour is expected.48 It is, therefore, important to connect the project  Table 2. Recommendations for managing NBD projects  1) Match the project’s autonomy to the newness of required technological and market knowledge (see Figure 1).  The more development of technological and market knowledge is required, the higher should be the project’s  autonomy.  2) Align project completion criteria with the development of technological and market knowledge. As the develop-  completion criteria to the timing and duration of the exploration of technological and market  knowledge.  Third, senior management support can offset some of these contingencies regarding project com-  impact NBD projects have on the requirements for the company’s sales force. In the case of signif-  icant exploration of market knowledge, the existing sales force might have to learn new skills to  market the new product successfully. If sales employees are judged against exploitative criteria  (i.e. the need to achieve a certain amount of sales each year), they have little incentive to invest  time and resources selling a product for which success is uncertain. Thus alignment of incentive  structures for the sales force with the requirements of an NBD project is an important factor in  the ultimate success of the NBD project.52  Theoretical implications and conclusions  Several implications for theory also resulted from our findings. Previous studies have shown that  project and organisational requirements differ for radical versus incremental innovations.53 Radical  innovations have been classified as requiring both new technological knowledge and new market  knowledge, while incremental innovations use and leverage existing knowledge. We complemented  this literature by also addressing projects that either focus on new technological knowledge or new  market knowledge (see Figure 1), and show that the managerial and organisational requirements  differ for both types of projects.  This more fine-grained description of NBD projects contributes to knowledge and innovation  literature by showing that technological and market knowledge differ in terms of timing when ex-  ploratory activities take place. Danneels argued that technological and market knowledge differ in  terms of competence bases.54 Our findings indicate that exploring new technological knowledge  takes place in the development phase preceding market introduction, while creating market knowl-  edge largely takes place during the commercialisation phase (see Figure 2). This also points to the  importance for more specifically addressing the commercialisation phase in product development  and project management research.  Finally, we complement project management literature by addressing the under-researched rela-  tion between NBD projects and their organisational context.55 In particular, we show that NBD  projects exploring new markets can place significant demands on the company’s sales force to  such an extent that it triggers organisational renewal. The demand for organisational renewal  68 Why New Business Development Projects Failpletion and autonomy. Figure 1 presents an idealised model that provides sufficient protection  from business pressures for each type of project. We argued that a mismatch between auton-  omy/completion criteria and knowledge requirements could result in increasing business pressure  and higher chance of project failure. Yet, senior management supporters (champions) were able to  protect projects from too much pressure.49 Project Oral’s champion, for example, allowed the pro-  ject to undertake the necessary exploration even though organisational procedures suggested other-  wise. However, support is often not a sustainable solution, as for example job rotations could mean  that champions are replaced by new and perhaps less favourable managers.50 For example, project  Air suffered from replacement of its champion. Champions have thus positive effects on NBD pro-  ject success, but management should be aware of the potential negative consequences if a champion  is promoted or leaves.  Fourth, another way of dealing with the conflicting forces of long development times for market  knowledge versus increasing business pressures to show results is the use of strategic alliances to  access complementary market knowledge. This significantly reduces development time and costs.51  It reduces the need to explore market knowledge during the commercialisation phase, which was  one of the main contributors to project failure in our study. In particular, if the existing sales force  is not equipped for selling the newly-developed products, management will have to invest substan-  tial resources to build up a new sales force for the project. Using a strategic alliance (e.g. project  Drink) could reduce or eliminate the need to build a new sales force.  Fifth, the case study showed that senior management should devote significant attention to the  may be offset by alliance partners possessing complementary knowledge and capabilities. By doing  so, we have contributed to the emerging debate on using alliances in NBD projects.  Several future research issues also emerged from our findings. A logical next step would be to do  meetings, progress presentations to top management and strategy documents. For each project,  the data was categorised into our main variables such as exploration of technological and market  knowledge, relations with other parties (inside and outside the organisation), and performance of  the projects. Based on the documentation, case narratives were written for each project to describe  the development of the projects over time.  To provide a richer view of the projects, the third round of data collection included interviews  with key project members. We developed an interview guide based on the categories used in the  documentation process to cover the main topics. We used open-ended questions to invite respon-  dents to talk about a subject instead of pushing them in a predefined direction. The semi-structured  interviews lasted around 1½ hours each and were recorded, resulting in more than 200 pages of  transcripts. The transcripts were sent back to the interviewees for corrections and additions. In total  we conducted 21 interviews (two to three interviews on average per project). We selected key pro-  ject members that had a good overview of the entire project and its relationship with the parent  organisation (i.e. the project, R&D and marketing manager). We compared data from different  sources to check for potential retrospective biases in our after-the-fact interviews. A retrospective  bias seemed to be slightly present with employees still working at that division who had participated  Long Range Planning, vol 41 2008 69large-scale cross-sectional research to assess to what extent our findings can be generalised. It would  in particular be interesting to investigate the extent to which our findings apply to project-based  firms, projects in the service sector and to firms in the so-called Complex Products and Systems  (CoPS) projects sectors, which develop one-off products and are often built to order.56 In the latter  case, we expect the order in which both types of exploration takes place would be different, as sell-  ing and marketing would precede actual technological development. We invite further research to  investigate possible other contingencies regarding the exploration of technological and market  knowledge, such as the internal organisation of a project and the type of project manager needed.  In conclusion, we have put forward the argument that developing technological and market  knowledge have an important impact on managing through projects. Our conceptual framework  and case findings provide guidelines to enhance the success of NBD projects in mass-manufacturing  companies. We showed that aligning project autonomy and project completion criteria with the  degree of required exploration of technological versus market knowledge is essential for successfully  managing new business development projects.  Appendix 1. Research methods  Using multiple cases allowed us to replicate our findings and strengthened the validity of our re-  search.57 The cases were selected based on a theoretical sampling logic following our primary object  of interest, namely technological versus market exploration in the setting of NBD-projects. In the  logic of Figure 1, projects were selected in quadrants 1, 2 and 3. Furthermore, we expect the explo-  ration of market knowledge to continue during the commercialisation phase. As such, the selected  NBD projects needed to have reached this phase. Third, the sample had to incorporate both suc-  cessful and unsuccessful projects. We defined failure in terms of projects that were abandoned and  success as projects that became major, profitable businessesdcriteria that were only possible due to  the long timespan that our study covered (1993-2003).  During the 14-month period (2004-2005) of our research we first sat down with management to  identify the projects and key persons involved. These persons were approached for interviews and to  provide documentation on the projects. Snowball sampling helped us to identify additional con-  tacts. The first round of data collection involved publicly-available information and divisional-level  documents, such as annual reports, and strategy and budget documents, to gain insight into the  context at the time of the projects.  The second round of data collection concerned project-specific documents, such as minutes of  in an unsuccessful project. The overall description they gave of the projects was similar, but some  had a tendency to emphasize external causes for the project’s failure. Using documentation and  multiple informants allowed us to triangulate findings and control for retrospective biases in our  37, 569e590 (2004).  16. C. A. O’Reilly and M. T.
